We propose predicate control as an active approach to debugging such systems. The predicate control approach involves a cycle of observation followed by controlled replaying of computation, based on observation. We formalize the predicate control problem for both off-line and on-line scenarios. We prove that off-line predicate control for general boolean predicates is NP-hard. However, we provide an efficient solution for off-line predicate control for the class of disjunctive predicates. We further solve on-line predicate control for disjunctive predicates under certain restrictions on the system. Lastly, we demonstrate how both off-line and on-line predicate control facilitate distributed debugging by allowing the programmer to control computations to maintain global safety properties.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Debugging","Computer bugs","Distributed computing","Control systems","Safety","Distributed control","Programming profession","Acceleration","USA Councils","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming","distributed processing","program debugging","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offline predicate control","active debugging","distributed program debugging","passive observation","computation replay","boolean predicates","NP-hard","disjunctive predicates","online predicate control","global safety properties"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1998.670013","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First Merged International Parallel Processing Symposium and Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First Merged International Parallel Processing Symposium and Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/5485/14764/00670013.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1998.670013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicate control for active debugging of distributed programs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predicate control for active debugging of distributed programs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670013/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5907591","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Mar-3 Apr 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicate control for active debugging of distributed programs","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00670013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050542S","chronDate":"30 Mar-3 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5485","citationCount":"21","articleId":"670013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":670025,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Jun Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong-Jun Kim","id":"37293232100"},{"name":"M.G.

Miniaturization of inductive components for high frequency has been a key research area to address this issue; however, in general, miniaturized integrated inductors can suffer from low Q factors and/or self-resonant frequencies when compared to their discrete counterparts. In this research, a modified geometry of a solenoid type inductor using a surface micromachining technique is proposed. This inductor has an air core and an electroplated copper coil to reduce the series resistance, and its low temperature process is suitable for various packaging applications. An important feature of the proposed inductor geometry is the introduction of an air gap between the substrate and the conductor coil in order to reduce the effects of the substrate dielectric constant. This air gap can be realized using a polyimide sacrificial layer and a surface micromachining technique. Therefore, the resulting inductor can have less substrate-dependent magnetic properties, less stray capacitance, and higher Q-factor. The measurement result shows that this inductor has high Q-factor and stable inductance over a wide range of operating frequency. Also, various effects of geometrical factors have been investigated. Various inductors with the inductance varying from 1 to 20 nH and maximum Q-factor from 7 to 60 have been fabricated and measured.","doi":"10.1109/3476.670025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part C","pdfPath":"/iel4/3476/14622/00670025.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3476.670025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part C","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface micromachined solenoid inductors for high frequency applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Surface micromachined solenoid inductors for high frequency applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670025/","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5902295","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface micromachined solenoid inductors for high frequency applications","sourcePdf":"00670025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091709S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3476","citationCount":"77","articleId":"670025","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":670030,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

This paper presents a strategy to address this situation through the development of an intelligent machine maintenance tool (IMMT), a software-based maintenance system designed to analyze available equipment data in order to intelligently schedule both preventive and corrective maintenance operations. IMMT uses neural network based modeling techniques to identify when the collected tool data indicates maintenance actions are warranted. This paper provides an initial investigation of the applicability of these methods to model the frequency of nozzle and feeder errors in a surface mount component placement system. The distribution of component errors is modeled using back-propagation neural networks to estimate the amount of time until the next error occurs. Predictions for each nozzle and feeder in the system are then compared, allowing the preventive maintenance system to provide a ranked list of potentially faulty components. IMMT will ultimately be an on-line system for data-driven (as opposed to fixed-interval) preventive maintenance scheduling and dynamic diagnosis of machine faults.","doi":"10.1109/3476.670030","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part C","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3476.670030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14622","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part C","pdfPath":"/iel4/3476/14622/00670030.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling component placement errors in surface mount technology using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670030/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling component placement errors in surface mount technology using neural networks","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5902298","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling component placement errors in surface mount technology using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00670030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040887S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3476","citationCount":"9","articleId":"670030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":670100,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Peng","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Liang Peng","id":"37087386169"},{"name":"Yongjie Pang","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yongjie Pang","id":"37087259024"},{"name":"Yuru Xu","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yuru Xu","id":"37087158913"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4273-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"670100","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Neural networks","Motion control","Underwater vehicles","Sea measurements","Motion planning","Remotely operated vehicles","Control systems","Vehicle dynamics","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","neurocontrollers","motion control","position control","dynamics","kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sea current estimation","AUV","neural network","motion control","autonomous underwater vehicle","model reference control","position control","heading control","neurocontrol","kinematics","dynamics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670100","abstract":"For an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), sea current is an unknown varying parameter which can not be given before operation and which may impose significant influence on the performance of an AUV. Furthermore, it is difficult to measure the sea current from a moving or suspending AUV. This paper presents a technique for automatically estimating the sea current and finding the optimal heading through neural network motion control. By using a model reference neural network controller, the velocity vector of the vehicle can be oriented to point to the goal position. Meanwhile the heading of the vehicle turns to the angle where the lateral resistance approaches to zero. When the vehicle reaches the goal point, the heading is approximately opposite to the direction of the current. Thus, the AUV can estimate the direction of the current with little error.","doi":"10.1109/UT.1998.670100","pdfPath":"/iel4/5493/14773/00670100.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"243","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1998 International Symposium on Underwater Technology","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1998 International Symposium on Underwater Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UT.1998.670100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating the sea current and finding the optimal heading of an AUV through neural network motion control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the sea current and finding the optimal heading of an AUV through neural network motion control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5932765","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"17-17 April 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the sea current and finding the optimal heading of an AUV through neural network motion control","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00670100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032935S","chronDate":"15-17 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5493","articleId":"670100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":670109,"authors":[{"name":"Xuemin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xuemin Liu","id":"37087801011"},{"name":"Liang Peng","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Liang Peng","id":"37087386169"},{"name":"Jiawei Li","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Jiawei Li","id":"37087861985"},{"name":"Yuru Xu","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yuru Xu","id":"37087158913"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4273-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"670109","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670109","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Remotely operated vehicles","Underwater vehicles","Fuzzy logic","Intelligent control","Fuzzy control","Marine vehicles","Artificial neural networks","Oceans","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","intelligent control","path planning","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy control","neurocontrollers","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural networks","autonomous underwater vehicle","obstacle avoidance","fuzzy control","manoeuvring mathematical model","path planning","intelligent control","neurocontrol"]}],"doi":"10.1109/UT.1998.670109","pdfPath":"/iel4/5493/14773/00670109.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1998 International Symposium on Underwater Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1998 International Symposium on Underwater Technology","startPage":"282","endPage":"286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UT.1998.670109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle avoidance using fuzzy neural networks","abstract":"If an underwater vehicle is to be completely autonomous, it must have the ability to avoid obstacles to safely operate.

As a result, the AUV is provided with the ability of obstacle avoidance at the beginning, which greatly shortens the time of network learning.

Because field overlap and junction perimeter defects become relatively more important when the critical dimensions of circuits are scaled to smaller sizes, they dominate yield loss of high-density circuits, magnifying their importance for future technology generations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/14640/00670169.pdf","doi":"10.1109/66.670169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.670169","startPage":"232","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of copper contamination on field overlap edges and perimeter junction leakage current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670169/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of copper contamination on field overlap edges and perimeter junction leakage current","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5924224","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of copper contamination on field overlap edges and perimeter junction leakage current","sourcePdf":"00670169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041401S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"31","articleId":"670169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":670207,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The inertial sensor suit consists of three orthogonally mounted solid state rate gyros. GPS is used for attitude determination in a triple antenna ultra short baseline configuration. A complementary filter is used to combine the information from the inertial sensors with the attitude information derived from GPS. The inertial sensors provide attitude information at a sufficiently high bandwidth to drive an inexpensive glass-cockpit type display for pilot-in-the-loop control. The low bandwidth GPS attitude is used to calibrate the rate gyro biases on-line. Data collected during laboratory testing is used to construct error models for the inertial sensors. Analysis based on these models shows that the system can coast through momentary GPS outages lasting 2 minutes with attitude errors less than 6 degrees. Actual performance observed during ground and flight tests with GPS off was found to be substantially better than that predicted by manufacturer supplied specification sheets. Based on this, it is concluded that off-line calibration combined with GPS based in-flight calibration can dramatically improve the performance of inexpensive automotive grade inertial sensors. Data collected from flight tests indicate that some of the automotive grade inertial sensors (180 deg/hr) can perform near the low end of tactical grade (10 deg/hr) sensors for short periods of time after being calibrated on-line by GPS.","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.1998.670207","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1998 Position Location and Navigation Symposium (Cat.

Resource management deals with the available spectral band, time, power, and space for a transmission signal. It includes (i) the frequency planning and (ii) the assignment of transmission resources to users. The paper presents a generalized notation as well as graph algorithms for resource management problems. Impairment graphs can be used for frequency planning, whereas flow graphs are suitable for resource assignment problems. To evaluate the performance of the resource management, service criteria (such as blocking or the carrier to interference ratio C/I) or efficiency criteria (bandwidth requirements) can be derived from the graphs. The resource management techniques are applied to satellite networks with non-geostationary orbits yielding time-variant network topologies. Examples are provided for fixed and dynamic resource allocation schemes for a typical MEO satellite scenario. Satellite diversity can be also investigated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14775","publicationTitle":"1998 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

We present several practical schemes for implementing digital beamformers employing training sequences for initial weight adaptation and either periodically inserted pilot symbols or decision-feedback for weight updating during subsequent data transmission. The QRD-RLS algorithm was chosen for adaptive control of the array due to its robust numerical properties and because it lends itself well for parallel processing as required in high speed applications, e.g., mobile broadband systems (MBS). It is demonstrated how to map this algorithm onto a highly efficient systolic array architecture entirely consisting of identical processing elements which rely on CORDIC arithmetic to carry out all the required computations, thus enabling very economic VLSI implementations. Additionally, a fast method for joint reference signal synchronisation and array adaptation as well as a simple scheme which allows one to control multiple independent beams in parallel are discussed. Both of these fit very nicely with the proposed hardware concepts and can be exploited advantageously for multipath diversity combining or for the concurrent reception of several spatially distributed users sharing the same frequency and/or time slot. Results of bit-true computer simulations are included to illustrate the performance of the proposed techniques.","publicationTitle":"1998 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

In both schemes, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and its inverse are utilized. For OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), the inverse FFT transforms the complex amplitudes of the individual subcarriers at the transmitter into the time domain. At the receiver, the inverse operation is carried out. For single carrier modulation, the FFT and its inverse are used at the input and output of the frequency domain equalizer in the receiver. Different single carrier and multicarrier transmission systems are simulated with time-variant transfer functions measured with a wideband channel sounder. For OFDM, the individual subcarriers are modulated with fixed and adaptive signal alphabets. In particular, the performance degradation of single carrier and multicarrier transmission due to pilot-aided channel estimation is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/IZSBC.1998.670250","publicationTitle":"1998 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

The effects of synchronization errors in the receiver are analyzed. In a properly designed inner receiver, these errors lead to extra noise. Specifying the limits for this additional noise allows one to derive the requirements for each component and thus to design and optimize the inner receiver independently from the outer receiver. The resulting receiver structure and the synchronization algorithms applied are introduced. Particular attention is paid to the channel estimation unit since its accuracy is most essential for system performance. A short analysis of the complexity of the algorithms allows one to determine the limits of the single components. System simulations including inner and outer receiver are used to evaluate the ideal vs. the realizable performance of the receiver and thus show how it is bounded by receiver complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

Phase noise causes a common phase error (CPE) and inter-carrier interferences (ICI). The former is easy to estimate and equalize, since it identically affects all subcarriers. It is shown that neither a significant degradation of the symbol error rate (SER) due to CPE nor a detrimental error floor due to ICI is introduced provided the constant range of the phase noise power spectral density (PSD) of the stabilized oscillator does not exceed 20 kHz. Above that limit, the SER performance is dominated by a prohibitive error floor caused by ICI.","doi":"10.1109/IZSBC.1998.670252","publicationTitle":"1998 International Zurich Seminar on Broadband Communications.

This specific application is related to an on-line estimation problem for sensor validation purposes. Neural-network-based microprocessors are starting to be commercially available. However, most of them feature a learning performed with the classic back-propagation algorithm (BPA). To overcome this lack of flexibility a customized motherboard with transputers was implemented for this investigation, The extended BPA (EBPA), a modified and more effective BPA, was used for the on-line learning, These parallel hardware-based neural architectures were used to implement a sensor failure detection, identification, and accommodation scheme in the model of a night control system assumed to be without physical redundancy in the sensory capabilities. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for these neural schemes for implementation in actual flight control systems of modern high performance aircraft, taking advantage of the characteristics of the extended back-propagation along with the parallel computation capabilities of NN customized hardware.","doi":"10.1109/7.670327","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/14739/00670327.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.670327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor validation using hardware-based on-line learning neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"Sensor validation using hardware-based on-line learning neural networks","volume":"34","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5909284","publicationDate":"April 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor validation using hardware-based on-line learning neural networks","sourcePdf":"00670327.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047011S","chronDate":"Apr 1998","isNumber":"14739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"26","articleId":"670327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":670328,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

Segmentation is an integral process in the Informedia digital video library. The success of the Informedia project hinges on two critical assumptions: that we can extract sufficiently accurate speech recognition transcripts from the broadcast audio and that we can segment the broadcast into video paragraphs, or stories, that are useful for information retrieval. In previous papers we have shown that speech recognition is sufficient for information retrieval of pre-segmented video news stories. We now address the issue of segmentation and demonstrate that a fully automatic system can extract story boundaries using available audio, video and closed-captioning cues. The story segmentation step for the Informedia Digital Video Library splits full-length news broadcasts into individual news stories. During this phase the system also labels commercials as separate \"stories\". We explain how the Informedia system takes advantage of the closed captioning frequently broadcast with the news, how it extracts timing information by aligning the closed-captions with the result of the speech recognition, and how the system integrates closed-caption cues with the results of image and audio processing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Forum on Research and Technology Advances in Digital Libraries -ADL'98-","pdfPath":"/iel4/5492/14771/00670392.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Forum on Research and Technology Advances in Digital Libraries -ADL'98-","doi":"10.1109/ADL.1998.670392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADL.1998.670392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Story segmentation and detection of commercials in broadcast news video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Digital audio broadcasting","Software libraries","Data mining","Speech recognition","Information retrieval","Indexing","Content based retrieval","Fasteners","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","image recognition","video signal processing","speech recognition","indexing","multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["story segmentation","story detection","broadcast news video","commercials","Informedia Digital Library Project","full content indexing","content retrieval","text","audio","video","digital video library","speech recognition transcripts","information retrieval","video news stories","closed-captioning cues","full-length news broadcasts","news stories","audio processing","image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"Story segmentation and detection of commercials in broadcast news video","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5927547","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Story segmentation and detection of commercials in broadcast news video","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00670392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062203S","chronDate":"22-24 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5492","citationCount":"52","articleId":"670392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":670395,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Many systems are capable of both types of operation, and hence in this paper the fusion of such pulses is examined from a system point of view (i.e., tracking performance) via hybrid conditional averaging (HYCA), a new but increasingly accepted technique for evaluating tracking performance in the presence of missed detections. It is shown that tracking errors are highly dependent on the waveform used, and in many situations tracking performance using a good heterogeneous waveform is improved by an order of magnitude when compared with a scheme using a homogeneous pulse (CF or FM) with the same energy. Between the two types of FM considered (upsweep and downsweep), it is shown that the upsweep is always superior. Also investigated is an alternating-pulse system, which, while suboptimal, appears to offer robust performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection-tracking performance with combined waveforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.670395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/14739/00670395.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.670395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"Detection-tracking performance with combined waveforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1998","accessionNumber":"5909298","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection-tracking performance with combined waveforms","sourcePdf":"00670395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037433S","chronDate":"Apr 1998","isNumber":"14739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"65","articleId":"670395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":670415,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

It focuses on systems where a single chip DRAM/processor will not be feasible even in 10 years, e.g. systems requiring a large memory and/or many CPU's. In such systems a solution needs to be found to DRAM latency and bandwidth as well as to inter-chip communication. Utilizing the projected advances in chip I/O bandwidth we propose to implement a decoupled access-execute processor where the access processor is placed in memory. A program is compiled to run as a computational process and several access processes with the latter executing in the DRAM processors. Instruction set extensions are discussed to support this paradigm. Using multi-level branch prediction the access processor stays ahead of the execute processor and keeps the latter supplied with data. The system reduces latency by moving address computation to memory and thus avoiding sending address to memory by the computational processor. This and the fetch-ahead capabilities of the access processor are combined with multiple DRAM \"streaming\" to improve performance. DRAM caching is assumed to be used to assist in this as well.","doi":"10.1109/IWIA.1997.670415","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Innovative Architecture for Future Generation High-Performance Processors and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Innovative Architecture for Future Generation High-Performance Processors and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/5473/14741/00670415.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWIA.1997.670415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled access DRAM architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled access DRAM architecture","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5927595","conferenceDate":"24-24 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled access DRAM architecture","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00670415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043108S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5473","citationCount":"1","articleId":"670415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":670443,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For simple analytical models, we introduce the most favorable trap position, which gives the largest contribution to the leakage current. A-mode and B-mode SILC are the leakage currents in the nominal oxide region and at the weak oxide spots, respectively, which can be deduced by the large difference in the area density between the single trap area (/spl sim/1/spl times/10/sup 11/ cm/sup -2/) and the multi-trap path (/spl sim/1/spl times/10/sup 2/ cm/sup -2/).

In this work, the influence of the measurement conditions on Q/sub BD/ is examined, as well as the relationship between Q/sub BD/ and oxide thickness. Using oxides ranging from 45 /spl Aring/ to 80 /spl Aring/, two Q/sub BD/ measurement methods are employed: constant current stress (CCS) and an exponential current ramp (ECR). A variety of current densities (for constant current stress) and step durations (for exponential current ramp) are studied. It is shown that not only does Q/sub BD/ depend on oxide thickness, but that Q/sub BD/ depends strongly on the measurement conditions, and that, depending on the test conditions, Q/sub BD/ can increase or decrease as the oxide thickness decreases. It is also shown that there is a strong agreement between the Q/sub BD/ measured with a constant current stress and the Q/sub BD/ measured with an exponential current ramp. Finally, an algorithm is proposed for transforming the Q/sub BD/ distribution obtained from a series of exponential current ramps into the Q/sub BD/ and/or t/sub BD/ domains of constant current stressing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1998.670448","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 36th Annual (Cat.

Three GSO scintillators with different concentration of Ce were chosen and stacked along depth of interaction direction and optically coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a position sensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT). In the beginning, pulse shape, light output and zero-cross time were measured so as to select a proper combination of GSO scintillators with different concentrations of Ce. Selecting three GSO scintillators with different concentration of Ce, a single stacked GSO/PMT depth of interaction detector was fabricated for estimating the possibility of this method. Using the zero-cross time analysis, three peaks correspond to decay times of the three GSO scintillator were obtained. Finally, a GSO/PSPMT depth of interaction block detector was fabricated and tested. The block detector consists of 7/spl times/7 matrix of GSO scintillators which have three layers of different concentrations of Ce optically coupled to a PSPMT. The pulse shape analysis was used for determination of depth of interaction direction while the Anger logic was used for transaxial and axial directions. Good separations were obtained in depth of interaction direction as well as transaxial and axial direction. These results indicate that the GSO block detector may become one solution for developing a positron emission tomograph (PET) with depth of interaction detection capability.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670466","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel4/5472/14740/00670466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14740","startPage":"944","endPage":"948 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GSO depth of interaction detector for PET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A GSO depth of interaction detector for PET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670466/","conferenceDate":"9-15 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"6068760","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GSO depth of interaction detector for PET","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00670466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036103S","chronDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5472","articleId":"670466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":670503,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The approach was put to a first experimental test by manufacturing two prototypes with LSO crystals of dimensions 4/spl times/4/spl times/30 mm and 2.5/spl times/2.5/spl times/20 mm respectively, each comprising three segments along their longitudinal axis. Measurements of their absolute pulse height responses when irradiated by 511 keV photons are presented and evidence resolved peaks for photoelectric interactions occurring in each longitudinal segment as desired. For the second of the above prototypes, the lowest (highest) of these peaks is measured to correspond to a pulse height of 335(559) photoelectrons with full-width-at-half-maximum resolution of 28%(12%).

For PET applications without collimators, the high counting rates place severe demands on such large area detectors. The NaI(Tl) detectors in the PENN-PET scanners are read-out via photomultiplier tubes and preamplifiers. Those preamplifiers use a delay-line clipping technique to shorten the characteristic 240 ns fall time of the NaI(Tl) signal. As an alternative, the authors have investigated a pole-zero network to shorten the signal followed by a multi-pole shaper to produce a symmetric signal suitable for high counting rates. This has been compared to the authors' current design by measuring the energy and spatial resolution of a single detector as a function of different preamplifier designs. Data were taken over a range of ADC integration times and countrates. The new design shows improved energy resolution with short integration times. Effects on spatial resolution and deadtime are reported for position sensitive detectors at different countrates.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670518","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1174 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel4/5472/14740/00670518.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of multi-pole shaping and delay line clipping pre-amplifiers for position sensitive NaI(Tl) detectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of multi-pole shaping and delay line clipping pre-amplifiers for position sensitive NaI(Tl) detectors","conferenceDate":"9-15 Nov. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6068806","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670518/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of multi-pole shaping and delay line clipping pre-amplifiers for position sensitive NaI(Tl) detectors","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00670518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039999S","chronDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5472","articleId":"670518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":670532,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The authors introduced an artificial neural network in the classification of these diseases. In this system the neural network was trained by feature parameters extracted from B-mode ultrasonic images of normal liver (NL), CAH and LC. Therefore one need not input any a priori information about these diseases. For input data the authors used 7 parameters calculated by 5 regions of interest (ROIs) in each image. They are variance of pixel values in an ROI, coefficient of variation, annular Fourier power spectrum, longitudinal Fourier power spectrum, and variation of the means of the 5 ROIs. In addition, the authors used 2 more parameters calculated from a co-occurrence matrix of pixel values in an ROI. The results showed that the accuracies of the neural network were 83.8% for LC, 90.0% for CAH and 93.6% for NL, and that the system was considered to be helpful for clinical and educational use.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670532","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1236 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14740","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel4/5472/14740/00670532.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative tissue characterization of diffuse liver diseases from ultrasound images by neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670532/","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative tissue characterization of diffuse liver diseases from ultrasound images by neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6068819","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-15 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative tissue characterization of diffuse liver diseases from ultrasound images by neural network","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00670532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090761S","chronDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5472","citationCount":"2","articleId":"670532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":670548,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

Coupling segmented crystals to a photodetector at one end yields distinct pulse heights from the different segments and the depth of interaction is determined to within the segment length. The method is simple to implement because no additional instrumentation is required. Since the technique uses light attenuation, a scintillator with sufficient light yield is required. The authors found that 4/spl times/4/spl times/10 mm/sup 3/ segments of lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) provide enough light for this application. The energy spectra of segmented crystals show clearly distinct photopeaks for each segment and the photopeak separation can be adjusted by altering the the optical couple between segments. An ambiguity exists between photopeak events from an attenuated crystal and scattered events from the crystal without attenuation. This leads to the same error as a system with no depth information. Using 10 mm segments the authors find that the fraction of the events in the lower energy window due to scatter contamination in 2-segment (3-segment) crystals increases from 8% (13%) to 32% (60%) for a source in air vs. behind 16 cm of water. In imaging situations with minimal scatter medium (e.g. rodents) DOI is accurately provided by the segmented crystals, while in the presence of scatter (e.g. WB, cardiac) the method is only partially effective, and potential improvements in scanner cost, sensitivity and/or image quality must be carefully evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670548","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel4/5472/14740/00670548.pdf","startPage":"1293","endPage":"1297 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1997.670548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth of interaction for PET using segmented crystals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Depth of interaction for PET using segmented crystals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"6075293","conferenceDate":"9-15 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth of interaction for PET using segmented crystals","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00670548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028044S","chronDate":"9-15 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5472","articleId":"670548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":670575,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

This anomalous charge loss phenomenon strongly depends on the electric field in the tunnel oxide, which is caused by the stored charge in the floating gate. Thus, an accelerated data retention test can be performed by means of the electric field in the tunnel oxide, by controlling the programmed V/sub t/ to be more than 2.4 V just before the retention test (here, neutral V/sub t/ is adjusted to 0 V). By using an accelerated test, it is clarified that controlling the number of surface micro-defects is important in order to obtain extended data retention characteristics. By reducing the surface micro-defects to less than 1.2/spl times/10/sup 20//cm/sup 3/, the data retention reliability after 10/sup 6/ to 10/sup 7/ write/erase cycles can be guaranteed for conventional 2-level flash memories, where programmed V/sub t/ is less than 2.4 V.","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 36th Annual (Cat.

Due to widespread industrial acceptance of 1149.1 standard, ICs are now expected to be 1149.1-compliant. At the same time, a typical IC, like the TMS470 microcontroller manufactured by TI, often contains multiple cores with built-in 1149.1 compliant Test Access Port (TAP), as well as significant amounts of non-core logic, which does not have any built-in test access mechanism. In this paper, we present a new TAP design that enables systematic integration of TAP'ed cores with non-TAP'ed logic, and makes the total IC 1149.1 compliant, at the same time. This TAP design, designated Hierarchical Test Access Port (HTAP), has exactly the same I/O pin specifications as an 1149.1-compliant TAP, and can either serve as an 1149.1-compliant TAP, or act as an arbitrator between existing TAPs in the Embedded cores. Behavior of the HTAP-whether to act as a TAP or as an arbitrator of TAPs-is controlled via the TMS input pin.","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1998.670842","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 16th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

An effective approach to the reduction of the download time is to compress test data before the download. The authors introduced a test data compression method which outperforms other methods for compressing test data. Our previous method was based on the Burrows-Wheeler transformation on the sequence of test patterns and run-length coding. In this paper, we present a new method, called COMPACT, which further improves our previous method. The key idea of COMPACT is to employ two data compression schemes, run-length coding for data with low activity and GZIP for data with high activity. COMPACT increases the compression ratio of test data, on average, by 1.9 times compared with our previous method.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 16th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

It has been found that destructive read-out depends on the level of the precharge. Two techniques to test open defects producing data retention faults are proposed. In the first technique an initial condition is forced during the working phase. In this way, intermediate voltages appear during the memorizing phase. Hence, the quiescent current consumption (I/sub DDQ/) increases and the fault can be detected sensing the I/sub DDQ/. A second technique controlling the power supply level in conjunction with sequential access is proposed. This allows detection of open defects by I/sub DDQ/ testing. The cost of both proposed approaches is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1998.670856","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 16th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

The fault and yield coverages of these tests depend on how the pass/fail test decision is made. In this paper we address the critical issue of accurate test threshold determination for these alternate tests. We propose to post-process the given set of sensitive and linearly independent measurements to synthesize a new set of measurements based on which the pass/fail decision is made. A novel methodology for post processing the measurement results called measurement synthesis is presented. Simulation results show that test effectiveness can be greatly enhanced by measurement synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1998.670860","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 16th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

Bose-Lin codes are an efficient solution for providing concurrent error detection as they are separable codes and have a fixed number of check bits, independent of the number of information bits. Furthermore, Bose-Lin code checkers have a simple structure as they are based on modulo operations. Procedures are described for synthesizing circuits in a way that their structure ensures that all single-point faults can only cause errors that are detected by a Bose-Lin code. This paper also presents an efficient scheme for concurrent error detection in sequential circuits.

A benefit of the proposed type-I single and double output checkers is that all faults are testable by a very small set of code words the number of which does not increase with the information length, that is, the checkers are C-testable. The proposed double output checkers are two-times faster than the corresponding single output checkers, but require for their implementation twice as many transistors as the single output checkers. The proposed single output checkers are the first known TSC Berger code checkers in the open literature, while the type-I single output checkers are near optimal with respect to the number of the transistors required for their implementation. The checkers of this paper with either, single or double output are significantly more efficient, with respect to the implementation area and speed than the already known from the open literature Berger code checkers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14777","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 16th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

We show that statistical encoding of test sets can be combined with low-cost pattern decoding for deterministic BIST.

However, commercially available torque transducers are expensive and not very accurate at high speeds. Elimination of the external torque sensor is an attractive issue in many applications. An electric machine processes its input current based on its physical characteristics and converts it to electromagnetic torque and hence can be considered as a current to torque transducer. However obtaining the mapping between electrical and mechanical terminals of an electric machine by analytical tools is almost impossible because of the nonlinearities involved in the process. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANN) have been used to find the above mapping for an 8/6 SRM drive system. In this paper, the torque production mechanism in SRM is first reviewed to get a closer look at current to torque transformation. Linear estimation techniques are then used for predicting the electromagnetic torque and their shortcomings due to the inherent nonlinearity of the SRM drive are shown. In the next step neural networks have been used to implement nonlinear dynamic predictors. Regressor structure, network topology and learning algorithms have been tuned to introduce a novel torque sensing scheme which can process the phase currents and predict the electromagnetic torque. Certain special considerations for various operations have been taken into account.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1997.670909","startPage":"21","endPage":"26 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IECON'97 23rd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation (Cat.

In contrast with other research, this method only makes use of the information about the skin region and the hair region of heads. At first, we use an efficient algorithm based on a perceptually uniform color system and fuzzy theory to extract the skin region and hair region, which are then used to detect faces in images. After that, the areas, the centers, and the axis of the least inertia both of the skin region and the hair region are calculated, which are then used to estimate the 3D pose of the head. We tested our method by estimating the 3D pose of a head from live video sequences. The three angles describing the three rotation elements of a head about X, Y and Z axes are extracted from each frame of the image sequence, which are then sent to a program that generates CG animations of a synthesized head in the estimated pose.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670930","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Head","Skin","Hair","Face detection","Robustness","Humans","Fuzzy systems","Data mining","Testing","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","computer vision","image segmentation","image colour analysis","fuzzy set theory","object detection","image sequences","computer animation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D head pose estimation","three dimensional head pose estimation","feature tracking","robust approach","skin region","hair region","uniform color system","fuzzy theory","face detection","live video sequences","rotation elements","image sequence","animations"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00670930.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.670930","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.670930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D head pose estimation without feature tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670930/","displayDocTitle":"3D head pose estimation without feature tracking","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5920392","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D head pose estimation without feature tracking","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00670930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074929S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"28","articleId":"670930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":670934,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

First, color segmentation of an input image is performed by thresholding in a perceptually plausible hue-saturation color space where the effects of the variability of human skin color and the dependency of chrominance on changes in illumination are reduced. We then group regions of the resulting binary image which have been classified as candidates into clusters of connected pixels. Performing median filtering on the image and discarding the smallest remaining clusters ensures that only a small number of clusters will be used for further analysis. Fully translation-, scale- anti in-plane rotation invariant moments are calculated for each remaining cluster. Finally, in order to distinguish faces from distractors, a multilayer perceptron neural network is used with the invariant moments as the input vector. Supervised learning of the network is implemented with the backpropagation algorithm, at first for frontal views of faces. Preliminary results show the efficiency of the combination of color segmentation and of invariant moments in detecting faces with a large variety of poses and against relatively complex backgrounds.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670934","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Humans","Layout","Skin","Image color analysis","Image analysis","Shape","Image segmentation","Lighting","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colour model","backpropagation","face recognition","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic detection of human faces","natural scene images","skin color model","invariant moments","Muhulanobis metric","shape analysis","color segmentation","hue-saturation color space","chrominance","multilayer perceptron neural network","supervised learning","backpropagation algorithm"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00670934.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.670934","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.670934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic detection of human faces in natural scene images by use of a skin color model and of invariant moments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670934/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic detection of human faces in natural scene images by use of a skin color model and of invariant moments","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5920396","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic detection of human faces in natural scene images by use of a skin color model and of invariant moments","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"670934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030645S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"79","articleId":"670934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":670939,"authors":[{"name":"J.

First, given an initial rough shaped 3D model, possible pose candidates are generated in a search space efficiently reduced using silhouette features and motion prediction. Then, selecting the candidates with high posterior probabilities, the rough poses are obtained and the feature correspondence is resolved even under quick motion and self occlusion. Next, in order to refine both the 3D shape model and the rough pose under the depth ambiguity in monocular images, the paper proposes an ambiguity limitation method by loose constraint knowledge of the object represented as inequalities. The method calculates the probability distribution satisfying both the observation and the constraints. When multiple solutions are possible, they are preserved until a unique solution is determined. Experimental results show that the depth ambiguity is incrementally reduced if the informative observations are obtained.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.670960","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00670960.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.670960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hand gesture estimation and model refinement using monocular camera-ambiguity limitation by inequality constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670960/","displayDocTitle":"Hand gesture estimation and model refinement using monocular camera-ambiguity limitation by inequality constraints","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5920421","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hand gesture estimation and model refinement using monocular camera-ambiguity limitation by inequality constraints","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00670960.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04351S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"68","articleId":"670960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":670963,"authors":[{"name":"K.

An AAM contains a statistical model of shape and grey level appearance which can generalise to almost any face. Matching to an image involves finding model parameters which minimise the difference between the image and a synthesised face. We observe that displacing each model parameter from the correct value induces a particular pattern in the residuals. In a training phase, the AAM learns a linear model of the correlation between parameter displacements and the induced residuals. During search it measures the residuals and uses this model to correct the current parameters, leading to a better fit. A good overall match is obtained in a few iterations, even from poor starting estimates. We describe the technique in detail and show it matching to new face images.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.670965","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00670965.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.670965","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","startPage":"300","endPage":"305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpreting face images using active appearance models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"Interpreting face images using active appearance models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670965/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5920426","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpreting face images using active appearance models","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00670965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03626S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"235","articleId":"670965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":670968,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Using PCA, we are able to construct a face subspace in which we apply LDA to perform classification.

In this paper, we present a correlation-based face recognition approach based on the analysis of maximum and minimum principal curvatures and their directions. We treat face recognition problem as a 3D shape recognition problem of free-form curved surfaces. Our approach is based on a 3D vector sets correlation method which does not require either face feature extraction or surface segmentation. Each face in both input images and the model database, is represented as an Extended Gaussian Image (EGI), constructed by mapping principal curvatures and their directions at each surface points, onto two unit spheres, each of which represents ridge and valley lines respectively. Individual face is then recognized by evaluating the similarities among others by using Fisher's spherical correlation on EGI's effaces. The method is tested for its simplicity and robustness and successively implemented for each of face range images from NRCC (National Research Council Canada) 3D image data files. Results show that shape information from surface curvatures provides vital cues in distinguishing and identifying such fine surface structure as human faces.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Curvature-based face surface recognition using spherical correlation.

In methods based on nearest neighbor classification, the representational capacity of a face database depends on how prototypical face images are chosen to account for possible image variations and also how many prototypical images or their feature points are available. We propose a novel method for generalizing the representational capacity of available face database. Any two feature points of the same class (individual) are generalized by the feature line passing through the points. The feature line covers more of the face space than the feature points and thus expands the capacity of the available database. In the feature line representation, the classification is based on the distance between the feature point of the query image and each of the feature lines of the prototypical images. Experiments are presented using a data set from five databases: the MIT, Cambridge, Bern, Yale and our own. There are 620 images of 124 individuals subject to varying viewpoint, illumination, and expression. The results show that the error rate of the proposed method is about 55%-60% of that of the standard eigenface method of M.A. Turk and A.P. Pentland (1991). They also demonstrate that the recognition result can be used for inferring how the position of the input face relative to the two retrieved faces.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.670982","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00670982.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.670982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalizing capacity of face database for face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670982/","displayDocTitle":"Generalizing capacity of face database for face recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5920443","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalizing capacity of face database for face recognition","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00670982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02634S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"5","articleId":"670982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":670990,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyou Zhang","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France","ATR Human Information Processing Research Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Zhengyou Zhang","id":"37087168150"},{"name":"M.

The first type is the geometric positions of a set of fiducial points on a face. The second type is a set of multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor wavelet coefficients extracted from the face image at the fiducial points. They can be used either independently or jointly. The architecture developed is based on a two-layer perceptron. The recognition performance with different types of features has been compared, which shows that Gabor wavelet coefficients are much more powerful than geometric positions. Furthermore, since the first layer of the perceptron actually performs a nonlinear reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space, they have also studied the desired number of hidden units, i.e., the appropriate dimension to represent a facial expression in order to achieve a good recognition rate. It turns out that five to seven hidden units are probably enough to represent the space of feature expressions.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.670990","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00670990.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.670990","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","startPage":"454","endPage":"459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison between geometry-based and Gabor-wavelets-based facial expression recognition using multi-layer perceptron","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=670990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"Comparison between geometry-based and Gabor-wavelets-based facial expression recognition using multi-layer perceptron","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/670990/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5920451","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between geometry-based and Gabor-wavelets-based facial expression recognition using multi-layer perceptron","confLoc":"Nara","sourcePdf":"00670990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063623S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"277","articleId":"670990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":671007,"authors":[{"name":"Rung-Huei Liang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Shih Chien University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rung-Huei Liang","id":"37087352426"},{"name":"Ming Ouhyoung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming Ouhyoung","id":"37087145260"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8344-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"671007","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":177,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2684},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=671007","abstract":"A large vocabulary sign language interpreter is presented with real-time continuous gesture recognition of sign language using a data glove. Sign language, which is usually known as a set of natural language with formal semantic definitions and syntactic rules, is a large set of hand gestures that are daily used to communicate with the hearing impaired. The most critical problem, end-point detection in a stream of gesture input is first solved and then statistical analysis is done according to four parameters in a gesture: posture, position, orientation, and motion. The authors have implemented a prototype system with a lexicon of 250 vocabularies and collected 196 training sentences in Taiwanese Sign Language (TWL). This system uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) for 51 fundamental postures, 6 orientations, and 8 motion primitives. In a signer-dependent way, a sentence of gestures based on these vocabularies can be continuously recognized in real-time and the average recognition rate is 80.4%,.","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.671007","startPage":"558","endPage":"567","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00671007.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.671007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time continuous gesture recognition system for sign language","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Handicapped aids","Vocabulary","Hidden Markov models","Data gloves","Natural languages","Auditory system","Motion detection","Statistical analysis","Motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handicapped aids","real-time systems","statistical analysis","hidden Markov models","image recognition","data gloves","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time continuous gesture recognition system","large vocabulary sign language interpreter","data glove","natural language","formal semantic definitions","syntactic rules","hand gestures","hearing impaired","end-point detection","gesture input stream","statistical analysis","posture","position","orientation","lexicon","training sentences","Taiwanese Sign Language","hidden Markov models","motion primitives","gesture sentence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/671007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"A real-time continuous gesture recognition system for sign language","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","accessionNumber":"5920468","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time continuous gesture recognition system for sign language","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00671007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026557S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"177","articleId":"671007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":671009,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This system is based on an architecture in which a supervisor selects and activates visual processes. Each process provides a confidence factor which makes it possible for the system to dynamically reconfigure itself in response to events in the scene. Visual processes for hand tracking are described using image differencing and normalized histogram matching. The result of hand detection is used by a recursive estimator (Kalman filter) to provide an estimate of the position and size of the hand. The resulting system provides robust and precise tracking which operates continuously at approximately 5 images per second on a 150 megahertz Silicon Graphics Indy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFGR.1998.671009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14786","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5501/14786/00671009.pdf","endPage":"578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active hand tracking","doi":"10.1109/AFGR.1998.671009","startPage":"573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=671009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"Active hand tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/671009/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5920470","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active hand tracking","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00671009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025427S","chronDate":"14-16 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5501","citationCount":"42","articleId":"671009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":671014,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We start by providing the mathematical basis for dynamic modeling and show that it is equivalent to a multivariate nonlinear prediction problem in the reconstructed space. We address the importance of dynamic reconstruction for dynamic modeling. Recognizing that dynamic reconstruction is an ill-defined inverse problem, we describe a regularized radial basis function network for solving the dynamic reconstruction problem. Prior knowledge in the form of smoothness of the mapping is imposed on the solution via regularization. We also show that, in time-series analysis, some form of regularization can be accomplished by using the structure of the time series instead of imposing a smoothness constraint on the cost function. We develop a methodology based on iterated prediction to train the network weights with an error derived through trajectory learning. This method provides a robust performance because during learning the weights are constrained to follow a trajectory. The dynamic invariants estimated from the generated time series are similar to the ones estimated from the original time series, which means that the properties of the attractor have been captured by the neural network. We finally raise the question that generalized delay operators may have advantages in dynamic reconstruction, primarily in cases where the time series is corrupted by noise. We show how to set the recursive parameter of the gamma operator to attenuate noise and preserve the dynamics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/671132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5917733","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Making sense of a complex world [chaotic events modeling]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making sense of a complex world [chaotic events modeling]","sourcePdf":"00671132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047978S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"109","articleId":"671132","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":671374,"authors":[{"name":"Makitani","affiliation":["Yokogama Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Makitani","id":"37087745627"},{"name":"Kawamura","affiliation":["Yokogama Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kawamura","id":"37087744653"}],"articleNumber":"671374","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=671374","doi":"10.1109/CPEM.1988.671374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPEM.1988.671374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14604","publicationTitle":"1988 Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements","pdfPath":"/iel4/5405/14604/00671374.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Reconstruction by Interleaved Sampling","abstract":"According to the Sarnpling Theorem, a given signal must be bandlimited to fo / 2 (fo is the sampling frequency) to be recoverable from its sampling data.

However, the processes of requirements negotiation are not well understood. We have had the opportunity to capture and analyze requirements negotiation behavior for groups of projects developing library multimedia archive systems, using an instrumented version of the USC WinWin groupware system for requirements negotiation. Some of the more illuminating results were: most stakeholder Win Conditions were noncontroversial (were not involved in issues); negotiation activity varied by stakeholder role; LCO package quality (measured by grading criteria) could be predicted by negotiation attributes; and WinWin increased cooperativeness, reduced friction, and helped focus on key issues.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Taxonomy","Software engineering","Computer science","Software libraries","Collaborative software","Collaborative work","Software systems","Multimedia systems","Instruments","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","systems analysis","multimedia computing","groupware","library automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software requirements negotiation","system life cycle","system value","software projects","library multimedia archive systems","WinWin","groupware system","LCO package quality","grading criteria"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1998.671616","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/5475/14745/00671616.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software requirements negotiation: some lessons learned","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=671616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Software requirements negotiation: some lessons learned","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/671616/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5920058","conferenceDate":"19-25 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Apr 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software requirements negotiation: some lessons learned","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"00671616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03742S","chronDate":"19-25 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5475","citationCount":"23","articleId":"671616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":671642,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The vector control methods, advanced scalar controls and adaptive and optimal controls are discussed. The intelligent control with fuzzy logic and neural network has been particularly emphasized.

A cascade M-level inverter consists of (M-1)/2 H-bridges in which each bridge has its own separate DC source. The new inverter: (1) can generate almost sinusoidal waveform voltage while only switching one time per fundamental cycle, (2) can eliminate transformers of multipulse inverters used in conventional utility interfaces and static VAr compensators, and (3) makes possible direct parallel or series connection to medium- and high-voltage power systems without any transformers. In other words, the cascade inverter is much more efficient and suitable for utility applications than traditional multipulse and pulse width modulation (PWM) inverters. The authors have experimentally demonstrated the superiority of the new inverter for reactive power (VAr) and harmonic compensation. This paper summarizes features, feasibility, and control schemes of the cascade inverter for utility applications including utility interface of renewable energy, voltage regulation, VAr compensation, and harmonic filtering in power systems. Analytical, simulated, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the new inverters.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IECON'97 23rd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation (Cat.

The drive behaviour, in terms of flux and torque response, is dependent on the voltage vector selection strategy utilised and the operating conditions. In this paper, a detailed discussion of DTC basic principles is carried out in order to determine analytically the relationships between the applied voltage vector and the corresponding torque and flux variations. The analysis allows the flux and the torque ripple to be easily determined. It has been observed that the effects produced by a voltage vector are strongly dependent on both the rotor speed and the voltage vector direction relative to the rotor flux. Some significant diagrams are presented showing the theoretical results obtained. The analysis can be useful in defining new voltage vector selection criteria and in optimising the dynamic behaviour with minimal torque and flux ripple.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1997.671793","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IECON'97 23rd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation (Cat.

The tank circuit of this power converter consists of a leakage inductance, a magnetizing inductance and two power capacitors with an inductive output filter.

The soft-switching mode and the sensitivity to the load variation, the coupling factor and the air gap (6-8 mm) are studied using the first harmonic method. The choice of the working range and the validity limit of the analysis method are presented.

It is important to sort suffixes because an array of indexes of suffixes is called a suffix array and it is a memory efficient alternative of the suffix tree. Sorting suffixes is also used for the Burrows-Wheeler (see Technical Report 124, Digital SRC Research Report, 1994) transformation in the block sorting text compression, therefore fast sorting algorithms are desired. We compare algorithms for making suffix arrays of Bentley-Sedgewick (see Proceedings of the 8th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, p.360-9, 1997), Andersson-Nilsson (see 35th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, p.714-21, 1994) and Karp-Miller-Rosenberg (1972) and making suffix trees of Larsson (see Data Compression Conference, p.190-9, 1996) on the speed and required memory and propose a new algorithm which is fast and memory efficient by combining them. We also define a measure of difficulty of sorting suffixes: average match length. Our algorithm is effective when the average match length of a text is large, especially for large databases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1998.672139","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1998.672139","startPage":"129","endPage":"138","pdfPath":"/iel4/5483/14760/00672139.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '98 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

In combination, these techniques allow the decoder to identify, estimate, and exploit the source structure.

Known algorithms for block-based multi-hypothesis motion-compensated prediction are, for example, overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) and bidirectionally predicted frames (B-frames). This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms in a rate-distortion framework. All blocks which are available for prediction are called hypotheses. Further, we explicitly distinguish between the search space and the superposition of hypotheses. Hypotheses are selected from a search space and their spatio-temporal positions are transmitted by means of spatio-temporal displacement codewords. Constant predictor coefficients are used to combine linearly hypotheses of a multi-hypothesis. The presented design algorithm provides an estimation criterion for optimal multi-hypotheses, a rule for optimal displacement codes, and a condition for optimal predictor coefficients. Statistically dependent hypotheses of a multi-hypothesis are determined by an iterative algorithm. Experimental results show that Increasing the number of hypotheses from 1 to 8 provides prediction gains up to 3 dB in prediction error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A locally optimal design algorithm for block-based multi-hypothesis motion-compensated prediction","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '98 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

A method that segments words in English text is introduced and is shown to be a significant improvement over previously used methods. A similar technique is also applied as a post-processing stage after pages have been recognized by a state-of-the-art commercial OCR system.

A context table stores all substrings in a text as their lexicographic orders. Examples of compression algorithms described in terms of context table concepts include LZ77 and the block-sorting algorithm. Since these algorithms are designed to work with an arbitrary source distribution, they can be expected to serve as an entropy estimator. A primal use of a context table is to reveal the capability of estimating the entropy. A context table makes it easy to understand several characteristic quantities including the recurrence time of a substring, the conditional recurrence time, and the length of the shortest unique substring. With the help of these concepts, some relations among apparently independent algorithms are established.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Mar-1 Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/672158/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6010840","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Context tables: a tool for describing text compression algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context tables: a tool for describing text compression algorithms","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00672158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029854S","chronDate":"30 Mar-1 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5483","citationCount":"2","articleId":"672158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":672173,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

Analysis of the general case is provided, which can be used to numerically design optimal MDTC systems. The case of two variables sent over two channels is analytically optimized in the most general setting where channel failures need not have equal probability or be independent. It is shown that when channel failures are equally probable and independent, the transforms used in Orchard et al. are in the optimal set, but many other choices are possible.

We extend the basic scheme to perform region-based compression, in which specified portions of the image are coded to higher quality with little or no side information required by the decoder.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1998.672184","startPage":"418","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '98 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

The EZW algorithm is extended to three dimensions and context-based adaptive arithmetic coding is used to improve its performance. The algorithm (3-D CB-EZW) efficiently encodes image volumes by exploiting the dependencies in all three dimensions, while enabling lossy and lossless compression from the same bitstream. Results on lossless compression of CT and MR images are presented, and compared to other lossless compression algorithms. The progressive performance of the 3-D CB-EZW algorithm is also compared to other lossy progressive coding algorithms. For representative images, the 3-D CB-EZW algorithm produced an average of 14% and 20% decrease in compressed file sizes for CT and MR images, respectively, compared to the best available 2-D lossless compression techniques.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1998.672188","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '98 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

Image compression relies on efficient representations of images, and within smooth image regions, the wavelet transform provides such a representation. However, near edges, wavelet coefficients decay slowly and are expensive to code. We focus on improving the transform by incorporating adaptivity. Construction of nonlinear filter banks has been discussed, but the question of how to utilize the nonlinearities remained. We answer this question by describing our transform via lifting. Lifting provides a spatial domain framework for the wavelet transform. In the lifting formalism, wavelet coefficients are seen as prediction residuals from a linear prediction operation. Wavelet coefficients are large near edges because the linear predictors are built to interpolate low order polynomials. Our goal is to avoid this problem by adapting the predictor based on local image properties. In smooth regions of the image, we use high order polynomial predictors. We adaptively reduce the prediction order to avoid attempting to predict values across discontinuities.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '98 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

We investigate lossless coding of video using predictive coding and motion compensation. The new coding methods combine state-of-the-art lossless techniques as JPEG (context based prediction and bias cancellation, Golomb coding), with high resolution motion field estimation, 3D predictors, prediction using one or multiple (k) previous images, predictor dependent error modelling, and selection of motion field by code length. We treat the problem of precision of the motion field as one of choosing among a number of predictors. This way, we can incorporate 3D-predictors and intra-frame predictors as well. As proposed by Ribas-Corbera (see PhD thesis, University of Michigan, 1996), we use bi-linear interpolation in order to achieve sub-pixel precision of the motion field. Using more reference images is another way of achieving higher accuracy of the match. The motion information is coded with the same algorithm as is used for the data. For slow pan or slow zoom sequences, coding methods that use multiple previous images perform up to 20% better than motion compensation using a single previous image and up to 40% better than coding that does not utilize motion compensation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '98 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

Integrated PAs with >1 W output are demonstrated in Si-based BiCMOS and CMOS technologies, but because their power-added-efficiency (PAE) is lower than that of GaAs, they are not useful in applications where long battery life is of concern. Here, the problem of low PAE is sidestepped by implementing the final power stage of the amplifier off-chip.

Cellular systems such as the advanced mobile phone system (AMPS) employ modulation schemes that generate constant amplitude RF outputs to use efficient but nonlinear PAs. Modern digital communication standards such as the North American dual-mode cellular (NADC) system require nonconstant amplitude RF outputs to maximize frequency spectral usage, and therefore require linear PAs. The traditional approach to linear RF power amplification is to back-off the output power of a PA until its distortion is reduced to an acceptable level. Power back-off can lead to significant reduction in output power and efficiency. The envelope elimination and restoration (EER) system is an alternative to power back-off, to simultaneously achieve efficiency and linearity in RF PAs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IC for linearizing RF power amplifiers using envelope elimination and restoration","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

An important building block is an A/D converter. /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ ADCs provide an efficient way of trading off speed for resolution. The switched op amp (SO) technique allows design of switched-capacitor (SC) circuits at very low supply voltage without the use of multithreshold technologies or voltage multipliers to drive the switches. The basic idea of it is to leave out the switches connected to the output of the amplifier in a SC integrator, because those are the ones that fail to conduct when the supply voltage is low. Switches can only be connected to well-chosen reference voltages. In this implementation the differential modified SO integrator cell is used, so the reference voltages are V/sub SS/ and V/sub DD/. This allows maximum overdrive of V/sub DD/-V/sub SS/ for the switches.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672379","startPage":"68","endPage":"69","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The article shows the expandable floor layout scheme (EFLS) of the DRAM macros. A macro architecture that consists of several banks has a disadvantage that the macro size becomes large, because each bank has peripheral circuits for independent operation. The EFLS eliminates this redundancy by sharing the peripheral circuits among the expansion units of the memory array. Two types of floor layouts are supported by EFLS. One is simple I/O type. The other is doubled I/O type. In both of the arrangements, a DRAM macro is formed by combination of 1 Mb memory array segments and peripheral blocks. Each block is manually designed so the macro size is minimized when all the blocks are combined together. Peripheral circuits that can be shared among 1 Mb segments are placed in the peripheral blocks to save the area.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672380","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The macro operation is generic, yet versatile, allowing gate-array or standard-cell interface personalization. The design has a wide databit interface of 128 or 256 bits, separate databit-in and databit-out to ease bus contention, bit-write capability for multiplexing to narrower databit widths or partial databit-writes, and granular-density options from 0.5 Mb-8 Mb. Built-in self test (BIST) with two-dimensional redundancy calculation and allocation, along with in-situ burn-in capability, is also included.

When the memory core supply voltage is reduced to below 1.8 V, the electrical performance significantly degrades in two ways. First, sensing speed slows due to the noticeable threshold voltage of source-floated transistors. Second, the necessity of a relatively high Vpp voltage for the word lines may require a tripler-pumping circuit that significantly increases power. In this 1 Gb synchronous DRAM, the bitline precharge level is Vss (ground). The word line reset level is -0.5 V to prevent cell leakage current while reducing the threshold voltage of pass transistors and thus to eliminate word line boosting. Power consumption is thus decreased since inefficient tripler boosting is no longer necessary. This technology is also suitable for merged DRAM and logic circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672385","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Conventional digital neurochips achieve high-speed operation by parallelizing processing on the premise that synapse weights are stored in on-chip memory and can be accessed at high speed. This premise restricts the size of a network and therefore the size of the problem that the chip can handle. To solve this problem, this digital neural network chip uses sparse memory-access (SMA) architecture to eliminate unnecessary external memory access. The chip, together with sixteen 1 Mb external SRAMs, handles a 1M synapse network, 50 times larger than a conventional on-chip memory-based neural network chip can handle. An external RAM access mechanism enables high-speed calculation using data stored in external memory. High-speed on-chip learning using SMA is implemented, another major advantage over previous chips.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Feb. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/672391/","accessionNumber":"5979222","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Feb. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 1M synapse self-learning digital neural network chip","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1M synapse self-learning digital neural network chip","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00672391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070878S","chronDate":"5-7 Feb. 1998","isNumber":"14797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508","citationCount":"2","articleId":"672391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":672396,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Sampling rate at the A/D interface can be increased by using multiple component ADCs that are time interleaved. Mismatches in offsets, gains, and sampling times among the component ADCs limit the performance of the ADC system. Previous time-interleaved ADC arrays use careful layout, foreground calibration and/or digital filters to minimize the effects of these mismatches. The presented time-interleaved ADC uses monolithic analog background calibration to match the gains and offsets of the component pipelined ADCs. The contributions are an expandible adaptive background calibration technique for parallel ADCs and a calibration loop that uses a mixed-signal integrator. The fully-differential prototype is fabricated in a 1.0 /spl mu/m CMOS single-poly process with poly-thin-oxide-diffusion capacitors. It includes 3 pipelined ADCs, one algorithmic ADC, the calibration signal generator, channel control logic, and 6 mixed-signal integrators, each followed by a unity-gain buffer that supplies the offset or reference correction voltage to one of the pipelined ADCs. The SC integrator and ADC stages use telescopic opamps with source followers at the input.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Signal sampling","Array signal processing","Performance gain","Digital filters","Prototypes","CMOS process","Capacitors","Signal processing algorithms","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog background calibration","parallel pipelined ADC","A/D interface","time-interleaved ADC","adaptive background calibration technique","calibration loop","mixed-signal integrator","fully-differential prototype","CMOS single-poly process","unity-gain buffer","reference correction voltage","10 bit","1 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672408","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

This CMOS APS imager is capable of enhancing signal to noise ratio (S/N) under low illumination through summation of signals from neighboring pixels. On-chip S/N improvement in CMOS APS is demonstrated by pixel averaging or by pixel binning. Pixel binning is implemented in a CMOS APS primarily designed for frame-transfer. That implementation suffers from extraneous noise pick-up and high-residual fixed-pattern noise (FPN) due to the use of single-ended column integrator. This APS has improved kernel summing circuits implemented in fully-differential topology. The imager performance is improved by greatly reducing FPN and temporal circuit noise. This multi-resolution APS is suited for application in light-level-adaptive imaging.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672422","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

A 5/spl times/5 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ pixel makes the 8.3/spl times/7.1 mm/sup 2/ IT-CCD the smallest yet applicable to the SXGA format. A two-phase drive horizontal CCD with phosphorus-implanted storage regions (PST-HCCD) with optimized wells so that they do not generate potential pockets under inter-electrode gaps helps reduce the driving voltage to 2.5 V. In still camera use, an overflow drain with self-adjusting potential barrier (SA-OFD) is attached to the HCCD to remove superfluous charges in the vertical CCD (VCCD) just before an exposure. A source-follower amplifier with separate p-well driver transistors with suppressed back-gate effects achieves a gain 11% higher than that obtained using a conventional amplifier.

Existing solutions for such low supply voltages are: 1) reduction of threshold voltages from 0.7 V to 0.3-0.4 V; 2) use of voltage multipliers. It is possible to reduce supply voltages to 1 V in standard CMOS without voltage multipliers.

Since the power consumption of CMOS VLSIs quadratically depends on the supply voltage, low-voltage circuits have been exploited. If a VLSI is operated in 0.5 V-0.8 V V/sub DD/ range for low-power consumption, the threshold voltage of MOSFETs, V/sub TH/, should be well below 0.5 V to turn the MOSFETs on. V/sub TH/ between 0.1 V and 0.2 V causes 10 nA-order subthreshold leakage current per logic gate in a standby mode, which leads to 10 mA standby current for 1M-gate VLSIs. This hinders application of the VLSIs in mobile equipment powered by a small battery. The super cut-off CMOS (SCCMOS) circuit overcomes this problem. With the SCCMOS, operation is possible below 0.5 V-0.8 V V/sub DD/ with 0.1 V-0.2 V V/sub TH/ and, at the same time, pA-order standby current per logic gate can be achieved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14797","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Currently available interface systems implement a capacitive measurement bridge in bipolar technology.

The active charge cancellation system (ACCS), an interface circuit architecture implemented in submicron CMOS, uses a feedback to directly sense and cancel the charge injected by MOSFET switch at the amplifier input. Unlike conventional methods that rely on component matching for charge injection compensation, the ACCS employs feedback compensation to provide more than two orders of magnitude reduction in charge injection error without requirement on component matching.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672462","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The sensor uses direct finger contact with the surface of the sensor IC to capture a capacitive fingerprint image. The sensor consists of a 2-D array of metal plates capped with a thin dielectric layer. Unlike previous designs, each sensing site uses one metal sensor plate. Each functions as capacitor bottom plate, with the finger surface acting as the grounded top plate. Distance between the finger and the sensor and hence the measured capacitance varies with the pattern of ridges and valleys in the fingerprint. The capacitance is \"measured\" as the change in voltage that results when a fixed charge is removed from each sensing plate.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672468","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

For a high-resolution display such as 1280/spl times/1024 pixels, more than 3.4 Gb/s of aggregate bandwidth is required over a 10 m cable. Since most graphic controllers synthesize the pixel clock to support various display resolutions, the pixel clock jitter exceeds more than 2 ns and the problem is further aggravated. The authors present an interconnect method for minimizing the effects of jitter in the pixel clock, thus improving the robustness of data recovery. The interconnect, comprising a transmitter and receiver, is fabricated with a 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS process. A 100-pin TQFP package is used for both transmitter and receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/672480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Feb. 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5999095","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A jitter-tolerant 4.5 Gb/s CMOS interconnect for digital display","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A jitter-tolerant 4.5 Gb/s CMOS interconnect for digital display","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00672480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030411S","chronDate":"5-7 Feb. 1998","isNumber":"14797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508","citationCount":"8","articleId":"672480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":672482,"authors":[{"name":"T.

CompressDRAMs are connected along the main memory bus, just as other conventional DRAMs are. A frame buffer is allocated on a CompressDRAM, and the graphics data is transferred in compressed form from/to the frame buffer. Here the memory bus consists of unidirectional command link and bi-directional data link, both at 200MHz, double data rate. A 40b request packet is issued from a memory/graphics controller to a target DRAM or CompressDRAM using 10b CA of Command Link, while a variable length data packet is transmitted over 16b DQ of Data Link (800MB/s peak bandwidth). A unidirectional READY signal is newly introduced to synchronize the controller and the CompressDRAMs.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672507","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Usually, the requisite A/D conversion is performed after the RF signal is down-converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) in the 0-100 MHz range, and the demodulation is digital. Design simplifications, such as the avoidance of in-phase and quadrature analog processing, can often be achieved if the A/D conversion is above 5 MHz, but in CMOS technology such systems are usually limited to about 12 b precision. This key component of a CMOS frequency-to-digital converter (FDC), a device that simultaneously performs A/D conversion and frequency demodulation, in certain cases, promises to be an attractive alternative to conventional non-zero IF A/D conversion.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672533","startPage":"366","endPage":"367","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Analog implementation of the entire channel has lower power consumption, because it eliminates the power-consuming A/D converter. It requires a BiCMOS process for precise analog circuits. The digital approach uses an A/D converter that provides precise digital signal processing. Here, the CMOS digital approach is used because it has potential for advanced signal processing. Two important issues are 1) reduction of the power consumption of extensive digital circuits and the A/D converter, and 2) breaking the speed bottleneck of the A/D converter. To reduce power consumption, a 0.4 /spl mu/m CMOS process with 3.3 V supply voltage is used. In addition, 3.3 V analog CMOS circuits are used, such as a gain controlled integrator for 7th-order equiripple active filters and an analog PLL.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672546","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

To mitigate the errors introduced during manufacturing or by user damage, a Reed-Solomon Product-Code (RS-PC) is used in DVD for error correction. For this application, the authors present an RS-PC decoder chip with a dual-frame-buffer architecture. The decoder chip contains two frame buffer controllers that interface with two off-chip frame buffers, a (182,172) row RS decoder and a (208,192) column RS decoder. The chip uses a cell library in a 0.6 /spl mu/m SPDM CMOS process. The 99-pin chip is packaged in a 100 LDCQFP package, where 48 pins are for frame buffer interface and can be eliminated with embedded frame buffers. The row and column RS decoders work at 33 MHz with a 3 V supply. The RS-PC decoder is currently limited in speed by the off-chip frame buffer to about 18 MHz. The power dissipation is 102 mW at 33 MHz.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14797","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Clock skew reduces the performance of the design and is a function of load, network distribution across the die, and device mismatch as well as temperature, and voltage gradients. This digital deskewing circuit can be used in microprocessor designs to equalize two clock distribution spines by compensating for these mismatches and gradients. The circuit is composed of delay lines in both spines of the microprocessor clock distribution network, a phase detection circuit, and a controller. The phase detection circuit determines the phase relationship between the two spines and generates an output based on the phase relationship. The controller takes the phase detection information and makes a discrete adjustment to one of the delay lines that was determined by the controller to require adjustment.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672552","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The energy and timing resolutions were measured as a function of photodiode bias and amplifier shaping time constant. While the performance of BGO and GSO is critically dependent on these operating parameters because the signal-to-noise ratio is degraded by the dark and excess noise from the ReAPD, that of the high-luminosity LSO and YSO scintillators is not. The energy resolution in these crystals is demonstrated to be limited by the scintillator resolution. Further analysis indicates that excess variance in the number of photons generated in the crystal is mostly responsible for their disappointing energy resolution.

The proposed forecasting algorithm captures patterns relation between the inputs: gross domestic product, money supply (held by the public), interest rate, number of branches of commercial banks, and loans, and the output: bank deposits, while keeping the absolute average forecasting error as minimal as possible. The results of computer simulations show the average error for a ten year forecast at around /spl plusmn/5%, which is within a satisfactory range. The results demonstrate that GAs can accurately forecast in the model of econometrics and finance, and that they do not restrict either the form or the regularity of the objective function.

The fuzzy CMAC network topological architecture is described. First, the continuous states of the system are partitioned into a number of fuzzy boxes. Second, the proposed fuzzy CMAC evaluates the Q-values of agents in the fired fuzzy boxes and chooses control actions with maximum Q-values. Then a critic generates an external reinforcement signal according to the outcome or the effect of the control at every time-step, which is used later for further improving the estimation of these Q-values. To speed up the convergence of reinforcement learning, the traditional PID controller with several groups of different parameters is adopted so as to collect a number of taught-lessons. These taught-lessons together with the experienced lessons generated automatically, are sequentially replayed and learned, respectively, under the guidance of different reinforcement mechanisms. The hybrid adaptive and learning control system is applied to the control of a pH-neutralization process. Simulation investigations show that the fuzzy connectionist Q-learning control system has more adaptive, higher intelligence, and stronger generalization ability compared to neural network or fuzzy neural network control techniques using supervised learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/672805/","accessionNumber":"5927159","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic neural network control through fuzzy Q-learning algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic neural network control through fuzzy Q-learning algorithms","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00672805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032384S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5482","citationCount":"3","articleId":"672805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":672809,"authors":[{"name":"Fu Kai","affiliation":["Chang'an office of Industrial and Commercial, Bank of China, Shi jia Zhuang Branch, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Fu Kai","id":"37087356337"},{"name":"Xu Wenhua","affiliation":["Agricultural University of Hebei, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"lastName":"Xu Wenhua","id":"37087072703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4253-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"672809","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":352},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=672809","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Stock markets","Investments","Economic forecasting","Macroeconomics","Industrial training","Production","Content management","Expert systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","stock markets","forecasting theory","investment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network training","genetic algorithms","stock price index forecasting","special stock knowledge","abstract data","shareholders","investment agencies","Shanghai Stock Exchange","short time prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIPS.1997.672809","pdfPath":"/iel4/5482/14763/00672809.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Processing Systems (Cat.

It has been proved to perform better than other heuristic methods with a number of established job-shop problem instances.

This is then followed by a logical combination of the so-formed neural network with a physical modelling exercise, leading to an improved semi-physical model which combines the advantages of physical and neural network modelling. The effectiveness of the proposed modelling techniques is illustrated by their applications in the establishment of two models, paper sizing and dry strength, for the wet-end chemical processes of the UMIST pilot paper machine.","doi":"10.1109/ICIPS.1997.672851","startPage":"584","endPage":"588 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Processing Systems (Cat.

In modern cellular, satellite mobile communications systems, and in GPS systems, both the desired and interfering signals change their directions continuously. Therefore, a fast tracking system is needed to constantly track the users, and then adapt the radiation pattern of the antenna to direct multiple narrow beams to the desired users and nulls to the sources of interference. In the approach suggested in this paper, the computation of the optimum weights is viewed as a mapping problem which can be modeled using a suitable artificial neural network trained with input output pairs. Three-layer radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) are used in the design of one and two-dimensional array antennas. The results obtained from this network are in excellent agreement with the Wiener solution. The networks implementing these functions are successful in tracking mobile users as they move across the antenna's field of view.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1998.673332","startPage":"216","endPage":"219","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '98 'Engineering for a New Era'","pdfPath":"/iel4/5503/14789/00673332.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '98 'Engineering for a New Era'","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1998.673332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach to adaptive nulling with neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Adaptive arrays","Artificial satellites","Mobile communication","Global Positioning System","Antenna radiation patterns","Interference","Computer networks","Artificial neural networks","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","adaptive signal processing","interference suppression","tracking","antenna radiation patterns","multibeam antennas","multilayer perceptrons","radiofrequency interference","mobile radio","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive nulling","weights","one-dimensional adaptive arrays","two-dimensional adaptive arrays","cellular communications system","mobile communications systems","GPS systems","interfering signals","directions","fast tracking system","radiation pattern","multiple narrow beams","nulls","mapping problem","artificial neural network","input output pairs","three-layer radial basis function neural networks","RBFNN","array antennas","mobile users"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Apr 1998","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to adaptive nulling with neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 1998","accessionNumber":"5939784","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to adaptive nulling with neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00673332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033053S","chronDate":"24-26 Apr 1998","isNumber":"14789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503","citationCount":"2","articleId":"673332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":673333,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The GORDIAN-L cell placement tool minimizes linear wirelength by first approximating the linear wirelength objective by a modified squared wirelength objective, then executing the following loop-(1) minimize the current objective to yield some approximate solution and (2) use the resulting solution to construct a more accurate objective-until the solution converges. This paper shows how to apply a generalization of an algorithm due to Weiszfeld (1937) to placement with a linear wirelength objective and that the main GORDIAN-L loop is actually a special case of this algorithm. We then propose applying a regularization parameter to the generalized Weiszfeld algorithm to control the tradeoff between convergence and solution accuracy; the GORDIAN-L iteration is equivalent to setting this regularization parameter to zero. We also apply novel numerical methods, such as the primal-Newton and primal-dual Newton iterations, to optimize the linear wirelength objective. Finally, we show both theoretically and empirically that the primal-dual Newton iteration stably attains quadratic convergence, while the generalized Weiszfeld iteration is linear convergent. Hence, primal-dual Newton is a superior choice for implementing a placer such as GORDIAN-L, or for any linear wirelength optimization.","doi":"10.1109/43.673628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/14803/00673628.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.673628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster minimization of linear wirelength for global placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Faster minimization of linear wirelength for global placement","volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5933464","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673628/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster minimization of linear wirelength for global placement","sourcePdf":"00673628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035644S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"32","articleId":"673628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":673629,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

Due to their efficiency and ease of implementation, one-wire-at-a-time downhill improvement heuristics are often applied to solve such problems. Unfortunately, when there are complex boundary constraints, the solutions from such heuristics can be far away from the global minimum. There are formal methods for solving convex programs, but they are too costly in terms of runtime for some applications. Some optimization techniques can be quite efficient but they solve less desirable formulations, such as minimum weighted sum of area and critical path delays. This paper proposes an efficient wire-sizing algorithm (EWA) that is able to trade solution accuracy for time efficiency while providing an upper bound on the distance from the optimal solution. EWA solves the practical problem of minimizing the total wiring area or the capacitance of an interconnect RC tree subject to hard constraints on the Elmore delay. The implementation is simple and efficiency is comparable to the available heuristics. No restrictions are placed on the circuit or wire widths. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimal wire width assignment for a minimum wiring area objective satisfies all the delay constraints as equalities when minimum wire width constraints are not active. It follows that EWA can be applied for problems with equality delay constraints such as clock trees. Moreover, this and other properties are general enough to permit extensions to higher order delay models and can be used to enhance other optimization methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EWA: efficient wiring-sizing algorithm for signal nets and clock nets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.673631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/14803/00673631.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.673631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=673631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"EWA: efficient wiring-sizing algorithm for signal nets and clock nets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5933467","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EWA: efficient wiring-sizing algorithm for signal nets and clock nets","sourcePdf":"00673631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031764S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","articleId":"673631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":673633,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The presence of such obstacles introduces inconsistency to a coding scheme, called sequence pair, which has been proposed for an obstacle free placement problem. We solve this difficulty by proposing a procedure called \"adaptation\" which transforms an inconsistent sequence pair to a consistent one with the utmost consideration for minimizing the modification. It is shown that a simulated annealing is well organized so that it tests only feasible placements by the adaptation procedure. As a design example, a Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmark data \"ami49\" is packed with treating ten modules among 49 modules as preplaced ones. Further, a PCB example which includes 32 free modules and four preplaced modules (connectors) is laid out successfully by our method with a conventional wiring estimation followed by a commercial router.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI/PCB placement with obstacles based on sequence pair","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.673633","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/14803/00673633.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.673633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=673633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"VLSI/PCB placement with obstacles based on sequence pair","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5933469","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI/PCB placement with obstacles based on sequence pair","sourcePdf":"00673633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032502S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"14803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"35","articleId":"673633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":673636,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The insertion of repeaters alleviates the quadratic increase in propagation delay with interconnect length while decreasing power dissipation by reducing short-circuit current, In order to develop a repeater design methodology, a timing model characterizing a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverter driving a resistance-capacitance (RC) load is presented. The model is based on the Sakurai short-channel /spl alpha/-power law model of transistor operation. The inverter model is applied to the problem of repeaters to produce design expressions for determining the optimum number of uniformly sized repeaters to be inserted along a resistive interconnect line for reduced delay. For a wide variety of typical RC loads, this analytical repeater model exhibits a maximum error of 16% as compared to a dynamic circuit simulator (SPICE). The advantage of uniformly sized repeaters versus tapered-buffer repeaters is also investigated using the repeater model presented in this paper. It is shown that uniform repeaters remain advantageous over tapered buffers and tapered-buffer repeaters even with relatively small resistive RC loads. An expression for the short-circuit power dissipation of a repeater driving an RC load is presented, A comparison of the short-circuit power dissipation to the dynamic power dissipation in repeater chains and related power/delay tradeoffs are made.","doi":"10.1109/82.673643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.673643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/14802/00673643.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeater design to reduce delay and power in resistive interconnect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","displayDocTitle":"Repeater design to reduce delay and power in resistive interconnect","volume":"45","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5925309","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeater design to reduce delay and power in resistive interconnect","sourcePdf":"00673643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040995S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"159","articleId":"673643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":673644,"authors":[{"name":"Shyh-Jye Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyh-Jye Jou","id":"37270102100"},{"name":"Tsu-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Taipei Satellite Telecommunication Center, Chung-Hua Telecommunication Institute, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsu-Lin Chen","id":"37613971600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"673644","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Voltage","Digital systems","Circuits","DC-DC power converters","Logic","Temperature dependence","Operational amplifiers","Differential amplifiers","MOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","VLSI","reference circuits","circuit feedback","differential amplifiers","convertors","voltage control","CMOS logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip voltage down converter","low-power digital system","differential-amplifier-based converter","DC-to-DC voltage down converter","negative feedback-type voltage follower","internal reference voltage generator","high current drive capability","single-poly-double-metal CMOS process","5 V","3 V","0 to 100 mA","0.8 micron"]}],"abstract":"An on-chip differential-amplifier-based DC-to-DC voltage down converter (VDC) is proposed.

Unlike other block matching structures, it estimates motion in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain instead of the spatial domain. As a result, it achieves high system throughput and low hardware complexity as compared to the conventional motion estimation design in MPEG standards. That makes the proposed architecture very attractive in real-time high-speed video communication. Importantly, the DCT-based nature enables us not only to efficiently combine DCT and motion estimation units into a single component but also to replace all multiply-and-add operations in plane rotation by CORDICs to gain further savings in hardware complexity. Furthermore, this multiplier-free architecture is regular, modular, and has solely local connection suitable for VLSI implementation. The goal of the paper is to provide a solution for MPEG compatible video codec design on a dedicated single chip.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Finite impulse response filter","Power harmonic filters","Interference","Electrocardiography","Delay","Design methodology","IIR filters","Magnetic separation","Magnetic field measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","pipeline arithmetic","parallel architectures","discrete cosine transforms","data compression","video coding","digital signal processing chips","real-time systems","VLSI","telecommunication standards","video codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined parallel CORDIC architecture","motion estimation","discrete cosine transform","DCT domain","high system throughput","low hardware complexity","real-time high-speed video communication","multiplier-free architecture","regular modular architecture","local connection","VLSI implementation","MPEG compatible video codec design","dedicated single chip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=673651","doi":"10.1109/82.673651","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/14802/00673651.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.673651","startPage":"653","endPage":"660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complete pipelined parallel CORDIC architecture for motion estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A complete pipelined parallel CORDIC architecture for motion estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1998","volume":"45","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5925317","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complete pipelined parallel CORDIC architecture for motion estimation","sourcePdf":"00673651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034273S","chronDate":"May  1998","isNumber":"14802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"27","articleId":"673651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":673652,"authors":[{"name":"Yawpo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yawpo Yang","id":"37616248900"},{"name":"Ching-Hwa Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Hwa Liu","id":"38129866900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"673652","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Phase modulation","Binary phase shift keying","AWGN","Probability density function","Phase shift keying","Quadrature phase shift keying","Additive white noise","Testing","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","signal processing","quadrature phase shift keying","probability","optimisation","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic optimal algorithm","modulation classification","M-ary phase-shifted keying","MPSK signals","exact phase probability density function","Tikhonov function","continuous wave","binary phase-shift keying","BPSK","quaternary phase-shift keying","QPSK","8PSK","performance","AWGN channel"]}],"abstract":"A suboptimal algorithm for modulation classification was proposed for classifying the modulation type of general M-ary phase-shifted keying (MPSK) signals.

Traditionally, a parametric reflectivity-snowfall (Z-S) relationship is used to estimate ground snowfall amounts based on radar observations. However, the accuracy and reliability of Z-S relationship are limited by the wide variability of the Z-S relationship with snowfall type. In this paper, the authors introduce a neural network based approach to address the problem of snowfall estimation from radar by taking into account the vertical structure of precipitation. The motivation for using a multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN), such as the radial-basis function (RBF) network, is the good universal function approximation capability of the network. The network is trained using vertical reflectivity profiles averaged over a 9-km/sup 2/ area as the input and ground snowfall amounts as the target output. Separate data, which are not part of the training data, are used to test the generalization performance of the RBF network after the training is done. Radar reflectivity data collected by the CSU-CHILL multiparameter radar and ground snowfall measurements recorded by snowgages located at the Stapleton International Airport (SIA), Stapleton, CO, and the Denver International Airport (DIA), Denver, CO, during the Winter and Icing and Storms Projects (WISP94) were used for this study. The snowfall estimates from the RBF network are shown to be better than those obtained from conventional Z-S algorithms. The neural network based approach provides an alternate method to the snowfall estimation problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5929294","volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Development of a neural network based algorithm for radar snowfall estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a neural network based algorithm for radar snowfall estimation","sourcePdf":"00673664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058187S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"1","articleId":"673664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":673667,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Unlike other prevailing methods, this algorithm has linear computational complexity and memory requirements, making it a suitable candidate for analyzing scattering from large rough surfaces as well as for carrying out Monte Carlo simulations. The method exploits the quasiplanar nature of rough surfaces to efficiently evaluate the dyadic Green's function for multiple source and observation points. This is achieved through a combination of a Sommerfeld steepest descent integral and a multilevel fast multipole-like algorithm based on inhomogeneous plane wave expansions. The fast evaluation of the dyadic Green's function dramatically speeds up the iterative solution of the integral equation for rough surface scattering. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the method in analyzing scattering from extremely large finite rough surfaces.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Iterative algorithms","Two dimensional displays","Computational electromagnetics","Magnetic analysis","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical prospecting","remote sensing by radar","radar theory","radar cross-sections","backscatter","Green's function methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","prospecting","exploration","radar remote sensing","backscattering","radiowave scattering","combined steepest descent-fast multipole algorithm","fast multipole algorithm","steepest descent algorithm","fast analysis","three-dimensional scattering","rough surface","random rough surface","dyadic Green's function","multiple source","multiple observation points","Sommerfeld steepest descent integral","multilevel fast multipole-like algorithm","inhomogeneous plane wave expansion","land surface"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.673667","startPage":"738","endPage":"748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/14800/00673667.pdf","doi":"10.1109/36.673667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combined steepest descent-fast multipole algorithm for the fast analysis of three-dimensional scattering by rough surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","displayDocTitle":"A combined steepest descent-fast multipole algorithm for the fast analysis of three-dimensional scattering by rough surfaces","accessionNumber":"5929297","publicationDate":"May 1998","volume":"36","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combined steepest descent-fast multipole algorithm for the fast analysis of three-dimensional scattering by rough surfaces","sourcePdf":"00673667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083423S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"71","articleId":"673667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":673674,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Phase unwrapping is a key problem in all quantitative applications of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, but also in other fields. A new phase unwrapping method, which is a different approach from existing techniques, is described and tested. The method starts from the fact that the phase differences of neighboring pixels can be estimated with a potential error that is an integer multiple of 2/spl pi/. This suggests the formulation of the phase unwrapping problem as a global minimization problem with integer variables. Recognizing the network structure underlying the problem makes for an efficient solution. In fact, it is possible to equate the phase unwrapping problem to the problem of finding the minimum cost flow on a network, for the solution of which there exist very efficient techniques.

In this paper, the OSP is revisited and extended by three unconstrained least squares subspace projection approaches, called signature space OSP, target signature space OSP, and oblique subspace projection, where the abundances of spectral signatures are not known a priori but need to be estimated, a situation to which the OSP cannot be directly applied. The proposed three subspace projection methods can be used not only to estimate signature abundance, but also to classify a target signature at subpixel scale so as to achieve subpixel detection. As a result, they can be viewed as a posteriori OSP as opposed to OSP, which can be thought of as a priori OSP. In order to evaluate these three approaches, their associated least squares estimation errors are cast as a signal detection problem ill the framework of the Neyman-Pearson detection theory so that the effectiveness of their generated classifiers can be measured by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. All results are demonstrated by computer simulations and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data.","doi":"10.1109/36.673681","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"898","endPage":"912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/14800/00673681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.673681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least squares subspace projection approach to mixed pixel classification for hyperspectral images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Least squares approximation","Hyperspectral imaging","Image classification","Computer errors","Signal detection","Character generation","Signal generators","Optical receivers","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical signal processing","remote sensing","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","land surface","terrain mapping","optical imaging","visible region","IR mapping","multispectral remote sensing","least squares method","subspace projection approach","mixed pixel classification","image classification","hyperspectral image","orthogonal subspace projection","linear mixture model","Neyman-Pearson detection theory","remote sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","displayDocTitle":"Least squares subspace projection approach to mixed pixel classification for hyperspectral images","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5929311","publicationDate":"May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673681/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least squares subspace projection approach to mixed pixel classification for hyperspectral images","sourcePdf":"00673681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05837S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"144","articleId":"673681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":673686,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The mechanisms are canopy scatter from a cloud of randomly oriented dipoles, evenor double-bounce scatter from a pair of orthogonal surfaces with different dielectric constants and Bragg scatter from a moderately rough surface. This composite scattering model is used to describe the polarimetric backscatter from naturally occurring scatterers. The model is shown to describe the behavior of polarimetric backscatter from tropical rain forests quite well by applying it to data from NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPLs) airborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) system. The model fit allows clear discrimination between flooded and nonflooded forest and between forested and deforested areas, for example. The model is also shown to be usable as a predictive tool to estimate the effects of forest inundation and disturbance on the fully polarimetric radar signature. An advantage of this model fit approach is that the scattering contributions from the three basic scattering mechanisms can be estimated for clusters of pixels in polarimetric SAR images. Furthermore, it is shown that the contributions of the three scattering mechanisms to the HH, HV, and VV backscatter can be calculated from the model fit. Finally, this model fit approach is justified as a simplification of more complicated scattering models, which require many inputs to solve the forward scattering problem.","doi":"10.1109/36.673687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/14800/00673687.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.673687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14800","startPage":"963","endPage":"973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-component scattering model for polarimetric SAR data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=673687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A three-component scattering model for polarimetric SAR data","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5929317","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-component scattering model for polarimetric SAR data","sourcePdf":"00673687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031446S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"1441","articleId":"673687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":673695,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

It further concluded that the MLE subsumed the OSP classifier in spite of a constant difference in their magnitudes. Coincidentally, the equivalence of the OSP approach to linear unmixing was also derived in J. Harsanyi (1993) and T. M. Tu et al.

In this communication, the author shows, on the contrary, that the MLE can be viewed as an a posteriori version of the OSP classifier and, thus, belongs to a family of OSP-based classifiers. More importantly, the author further shows that the constant produced by the MLE determines abundance estimation and has nothing to do with classification. As a result, it only alters the abundance concentration of the classified pixels, but not classification results.","doi":"10.1109/36.673697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/14800/00673697.pdf","startPage":"1030","endPage":"1032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.673697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further results on relationship between spectral unmixing and subspace projection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=673697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673697/","displayDocTitle":"Further results on relationship between spectral unmixing and subspace projection","volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5929327","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further results on relationship between spectral unmixing and subspace projection","sourcePdf":"00673697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053592S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"42","articleId":"673697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":673699,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

In this paper, we discuss the design of IBM's CMOS S/390 computer for control of mid-frequency noise. This machine has a 10-way multiprocessor on a 127 mm by 127 mm multichip module (MCM) on a FR4 board. The chips on the MCM cause a current step of tens of Amps in a few cycles that can be sustained for many cycles. The power distribution and decoupling capacitors must supply that current without disturbing the voltage level at the circuits.

The strategy has two main features to improve a total power factor and efficiency, taking harmonic components into account without detecting the voltage waveforms. One feature is a direct instantaneous power control technique for the converter, which has been developed to control the instantaneous active and reactive power directly by selecting the optimum switching state of the converter. The other feature is an estimation technique of the power-source voltages, which can be performed by calculating the active and reactive power for each switching state of the converter from the line currents. A digital-signal-processor-based experimental system was developed, and experimental tests were conducted to examine the controllability. As a result, it was confirmed that the total power factor and efficiency were more than 97% and 93% over the load power range from 200 to 1400 W, respectively. These results have proven the excellent performance of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/28.673716","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"473","endPage":"479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/28/14798/00673716.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.673716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct power control of PWM converter without power-source voltage sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Pulse width modulation converters","Reactive power","Switching converters","Pulse width modulation","Voltage control","Power system harmonics","Reactive power control","State estimation","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","reactive power control","digital signal processing chips","switching circuits","controllability","power factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct power control","PWM converter","power-source voltage sensors","voltage waveform detection","direct instantaneous power control","instantaneous active power control","instantaneous reactive power control","optimum switching state selection","estimation technique","power-source voltages","line currents","digital-signal-processor","controllability","total power factor","93 to 97 percent","200 to 1400 W"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Direct power control of PWM converter without power-source voltage sensors","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5935293","publicationDate":"May-June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673716/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct power control of PWM converter without power-source voltage sensors","sourcePdf":"00673716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03185S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1998","isNumber":"14798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"641","articleId":"673716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":673718,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper describes one method of meeting high MVA specifications by using multiple modules of two-level three-phase power converter modules controlled by the phase-shifted triangle carrier technique of the sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) strategy. Two conceptual designs are presented. The first is the gate-turn-off (GTO)-SPWM-UPFC at the lowest switching rate, f/sub c//f/sub m/=3, to minimize GTO switching loss. The design is based on applying the fundamentals of SPWM theory to overcome unbalances arising from sideband harmonic interferences. The second is the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)-SPWM-UPFC, at f/sub c//f/sub m/=12 or higher, in which SPWM theory assures that direct paralleling of the modules is free of current unbalance. A laboratory UPFC based on six modules of three-phase 5-kVA size IGBT power converters operating at the baseline condition of dual unity displacement factor at the sending end and the receiving end has been implemented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/673719/","volume":"34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1998","accessionNumber":"5935296","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"UPFC using multiconverter operated by phase-shifted triangle carrier SPWM strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UPFC using multiconverter operated by phase-shifted triangle carrier SPWM strategy","sourcePdf":"00673719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027286S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1998","isNumber":"14798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"30","articleId":"673719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":673729,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The k-merge problem is fundamental as it provides a common generalization of both merging and sorting. The main contribution of this work is to give simple and intuitive work-time optimal algorithms for the k-merge problem on three PRAM models, thus settling the status of the k-merge problem. We first prove that /spl Omega/(n log k) work is required to solve the k-merge problem on the PRAM models. We then show that the EREW-PRAM and both the CREW-PRAM and the CRCW require /spl Omega/(log n) time and /spl Omega/(log log n+log k) time, respectively, provided that the amount of work is bounded by O(n log k). Our first k-merge algorithm runs in /spl Theta/(log n) time and performs /spl Theta/(n log k) work on the EREW-PRAM. Finally, we design a work-time optimal CREW-PRAM k-merge algorithm that runs in /spl Theta/(log log n+log k) time and performs /spl Theta/(n log k) work. This latter algorithm is also work-time optimal on the CREW-PRAM model. Our algorithms completely settle the status of the k-merge problem on the three main PRAM models.","doi":"10.1109/71.674319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/14814/00674319.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.674319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=674319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Work-time optimal k-merge algorithms on the PRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/674319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1998","displayDocTitle":"Work-time optimal k-merge algorithms on the PRAM","volume":"9","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5898554","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Work-time optimal k-merge algorithms on the PRAM","sourcePdf":"00674319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041477S","chronDate":"Mar 1998","isNumber":"14814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"6","articleId":"674319","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":674320,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

To meet these demands, we must use high performance computing systems, such as parallel computers and distributed networks of workstations. We present two parallel computational methods for analyzing these biological sequences. The first method is used to retrieve sequences that are homologous to a query sequence. The biological information associated with the homologous sequences found in the database may provide important clues to the structure and function of the query sequence. The second method, which helps in the prediction of the function, structure, and evolutionary history of biological sequences, is used to align a number of homologous sequences with each other. These two parallel computational methods were implemented and evaluated on an Intel IPSC/860 parallel computer. The resulting performance demonstrates that parallel computational methods can significantly reduce the computational time needed to analyze the sequences contained in large databases.","doi":"10.1109/71.674320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/14814/00674320.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.674320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14814","startPage":"283","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel computation in biological sequence analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=674320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel computation in biological sequence analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/674320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1998","accessionNumber":"5898555","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel computation in biological sequence analysis","sourcePdf":"00674320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06433S","chronDate":"Mar 1998","isNumber":"14814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"38","articleId":"674320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":674322,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We use this parallelism in tasks to meet their deadlines and, thus, obtain better schedulability compared to nonparallelizable task scheduling algorithms. To study the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling algorithm, we have conducted extensive simulation studies and compared its performance with the myopic scheduling algorithm.

We present a novel approach to set up a neural linear or nonlinear feature transformation that is used as a preprocessor on top of the HMM system's RBF-network to produce discriminative feature vectors that are well suited for being modeled by mixtures of Gaussian distributions. In order to omit the computational cost of discriminative training of a context-dependent system, we propose to train a discriminant neural feature transformation on a system of low complexity and reuse this transformation in the context-dependent system to output improved feature vectors. The resulting hybrid system is an extension of a state-of-the-art continuous HMM system, and in fact, it is the first hybrid system that really is capable of outperforming these standard systems with respect to the recognition accuracy, without the need for discriminative training of the entire system. In experiments carried out on the Resource Management 1000-word continuous speech recognition task we achieved a relative error reduction of about 10% with a recognition system that, even before, was among the best ever observed on this task.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

This new and simple approach is based on the combination of speech enhancement using traditional spectral subtraction, and missing feature compensation to dynamically modify the probability computations performed in GMM recognizers. The identity of the spectral features missing due to noise masking is provided by the spectral subtraction algorithm. Previous works have demonstrated that the missing feature modeling method succeeds in speech recognition with some artificially generated interruptions, filtering and noise. We show that this method also improves noise compensation techniques used for speaker verification in more realistic conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/674382/","accessionNumber":"6046841","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speaker verification in noisy environments with combined spectral subtraction and missing feature theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker verification in noisy environments with combined spectral subtraction and missing feature theory","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00674382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023763S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"37","articleId":"674382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":674394,"authors":[{"name":"Kae-Cherng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kae-Cherng Yang","id":"38126951400"},{"name":"Tai-Hsuan Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan","National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Tai-Hsuan Ho","id":"37345618700"},{"name":"Lee-Feng Chienq","lastName":"Lee-Feng Chienq","id":"37086980417"},{"name":"Lin-Shan Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Lin-Shan Lee","id":"37271904300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4428-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"674394","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Vocabulary","Computer science","Information science","Speech recognition","Decoding","Context modeling","Character generation","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech processing","speech recognition","natural languages","statistical analysis","parameter estimation","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistics-based segment pattern lexicon","Chinese language modeling","Chinese character","wording structure","out of vocabulary problem","segment pattern extraction","training corpus","perplexity minimisation","language models","experimental results","large vocabulary speech recognition","forward-backward training algorithm","parameter estimation","sentence segmentation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new direction for Chinese language modeling based on a different concept of the lexicon. Because every Chinese character has its own meaning and there are no \"blanks\" in Chinese sentences serving as word boundaries, also because the wording structure in the Chinese language is extremely flexible, the \"words\" in Chinese are actually not well defined, and there does not exist a commonly accepted lexicon. This makes language modeling very sophisticated in the Chinese language, and the \"out of vocabulary (OOV)\" problem specially serious. A new concept for the lexicon is thus proposed. The elements of this lexicon can be words or any other \"segment patterns\". They should be extracted from the training corpus by statistical approaches with a goal to minimize the overall perplexity. The language models can then be developed based on this new lexicon. Very encouraging experimental results have been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.674394","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

They can be employed for detecting possible errors and can help to avoid undesirable verification turns in automatic inquiry systems. We propose to estimate the confidence in a hypothesized word as its posterior probability, given all acoustic feature vectors of the speaker utterance. The basic idea of our approach is to estimate the posterior word probabilities as the sum of all word hypothesis probabilities which represent the occurrence of the same word in more or less the same segment of time. The word hypothesis probabilities are approximated by paths in a wordgraph and are computed using a simplified forward-backward algorithm.

Spectral parameters are mapped using a locally linear transformation based on Gaussian mixture models whose parameters are trained by joint density estimation. The LPC residuals are adjusted to match the target speakers average pitch. To study effects of the amount of training on performance, data sets of varying sizes are created by automatically selecting subsets of all available diphones by a vector quantization method. In an objective evaluation, the proposed method is found to perform more reliably for small training sets than a previous approach.

These processes are all derived through the use of probabilistic learning methods which are aimed at the same optimization criteria.

Until now the results are far from being satisfactory. We present a speaker and task specific approach realized by a neural network. Personal and task specific characteristics are maintained and the demand of generalization decreases. Therefore the results in application can significantly be improved. Using an optimized network structure global and well localized patterns can be covered and trained simultaneously within one network. Correlation analysis of the data base versus the sensitivity of the trained network validates the importance of distinctive parameters in training. Based on this comparison we discuss the generalization properties of the NN trained speaker and task dependency. Finally a variation of the context range helps to find an optimized tuning of the input parameter set.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.674426","startPage":"297","endPage":"300 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

This is for the most part a straightforward choice in the case of word-based languages such as English, but becomes an issue even in handling languages with a complex compounding system like German; with an agglutinative language like Japanese, which provides no spaces in written text, the choice is not at all obvious. Once an appropriate unit has been determined, the problem of consistently segmenting transcriptions of training data must be addressed. This paper describes a method for learning a lexicon from a training corpus which contains no word-level segmentation, applied to the problem of building a Japanese speech recognition system. We show not only that one can satisfactorily segment transcribed training data automatically, avoiding human error, but also that our system, when trained with the automatically segmented corpus, showed a significant improvement in recognition performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.674428","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

The potential power of this new framework is explored, both algorithmically and experimentally, by an implementation with hidden Markov modeling techniques. This implementation is applied to the recognition of the 39-phone set on the TIMIT database. The new model achieves 74.4% and 75.6% accuracy, respectively, on the core and complete test sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

A major speaker independent cause of the reduction of recognition accuracy is a mismatch of the phonetic contexts between the training and testing data. To overcome this problem, we introduced in previous work the idea of an update of task independent acoustic models by means of Bayesian learning. In this paper we introduce a new approach of adaptively splitting the probability density functions (PDFs) of a continuous density HMM. The goal is to model the appropriate state PDFs better so that they can more accurately match new contexts that are observed while the system is in service.

Systems for a continuous online supervision of wear have to process pattern sequences. Therefore recurrent neural networks have been investigated in the past. However, in most cases where only noisy input or even noisy output patterns are available for a supervised learning, success is not forthcoming. That is, recurrent networks don't perform noticeably better than non-recurrent networks processing only the current input pattern like multilayer perceptrons. This paper demonstrates on the basis of an application example (online tool wear monitoring in turning) that results can be improved significantly with special non-recurrent feedforward networks. The approach uses time-delay neural networks which consider the position of a single pattern in a pattern sequence by means of delay elements at the synapses. In the mentioned application example, the average error in the estimation of a characteristic wear parameter could be reduced by about 24.2% compared with multilayer perceptrons.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.674463","startPage":"445","endPage":"448 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

If these units represent classes in a model this means that the distribution of samples between classes (the class prior) may be extremely nonuniform and that the distribution over many utterances in a training set may be very different from the rather flat distribution over any single test utterance. Using a neural network to model context-dependent phonetic units we show how to compensate for this problem. We do this by roughly flattening the class prior for infrequently occurring context units by a suitable weighting of the neural network cost function. This is based entirely on training set statistics. We show that this leads to improved classification of infrequent classes and translates into an improved overall recognition performance. We give results for telephone speech on the OGI Numbers Corpus. Flattening the prior for infrequently occurring context units resulted in a 12.37% reduction of the sentence-level error rate (from 16.17% to 14.76%) and a 9.93% reduction of the word-level error rate (from 4.23% to 3.81%) compared to not doing any compensation.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.674476","startPage":"497","endPage":"500 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

In WI, pitch-cycle waveforms are filtered in the evolution domain to decompose the signal into two waveform surfaces, one characterising voiced speech and a second representing unvoiced speech. The slow roll-off of FIR filters leads, however, to a significant inter-relationship between the decomposed surfaces. We present the pitch synchronous wavelet transform (PSWT) as an alternative decomposition mechanism. Filtering is again performed in the evolutionary waveform domain, producing characteristic surfaces at several resolutions. This multi-scale characterisation leads to more flexible quantisation of parameters, especially at higher rates than WI's 2.4 kb/s. FIR filters are replaced in the wavelet filter bank by causal, stable FIR filters which achieve significant delay reductions over their IIR counterparts. Furthermore, FIR filters track the dynamic aspects of the evolutionary surfaces faster, overcoming problems existing in the current WI decomposition.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.674480","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

An approach based on the use of a fixed-bandwidth analogue front-end for the implementation of a wideband digital SDR receiver was introduced by Karimi and Friedrichs (see, IEE Colloquium on Adaptable and Multi-Standard Mobile Radio Terminals, 1997) and the resulting impact on analogue-to-digital converter technology investigated. This paper examines a number of the architectural issues and trade-offs involved in the design and implementation of the digital signal processing aspects of such wideband receivers in the context of multi-standard GSM/DCS/UMTS digital radios.

Novel properties of the proposed protocols include: 1) offline trusted third party (TTP), i.e., TTP does not take part in the exchange unless one of the parties behaves improperly; 2) only three message exchanges are required in the normal situation; 3) true fair exchange, i.e., either A and B obtain each other's data or no party receives anything useful; no loss can be incurred to a party no matter how maliciously the other party behaves during the exchange. This last property is in contrast to previously proposed protocols with offline TTP ([1] and [21]), where a misbehaving party may get another party's data while refusing to send his document to the other party, and the TTP can provide affidavits attesting to what happened during the exchange. To our knowledge, the protocols presented here are the first exchange protocols which use offline TTP and at the same time guarantee true fair exchange of digital messages. We introduce a novel cryptographic primitive, called the Certificate of Encrypted Message Being a Signature (CEMBS), as the basic building block of the fair exchange protocols. It is used to prove that an encrypted message is a certain party's signature on a public file, without revealing the signature. We also give two examples to show in detail how the certificate can be constructed.","doi":"10.1109/SECPRI.1998.674825","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Cat.

In this paper, we study secure off-line authenticated user identification schemes based on a biometric system that can measure a user's biometrics accurately (up to some Hamming distance). The presented schemes enhance identification and authorization in secure applications by binding a biometric template with authorization information on a token such as a magnetic strip. Also developed are schemes specifically designed to minimize the compromising of a user's private biometrics data, encapsulated in the authorization information, without requiring secure hardware tokens. We also study the feasibility of biometrics performing as an enabling technology for secure systems and applications design.

Flexibility in the design permits the use of multiple code types and lengths needed for phase coded pulse compression and code sequences, which eliminate ambiguities, caused by high pulse repetition frequencies.

We briefly compare existing systems and give special consideration to active optical triangulation-based scanners.","doi":"10.1109/38.674969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/38/14827/00674969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.674969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14827","startPage":"28","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical 3D digitizers: bringing life to the virtual world","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=674969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optical 3D digitizers: bringing life to the virtual world","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/674969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1998","accessionNumber":"5913452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical 3D digitizers: bringing life to the virtual world","sourcePdf":"00674969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033938S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1998","isNumber":"14827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"43","articleId":"674969","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":675005,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

The DRRM scheme can only handle unicast cells, while the CMCR scheme can handle both unicast and multicast cells. The DRRM scheme can make over five billion unicast cell forwarding decisions per second with CMOS technology, while the CMCR can make over one billion multicast cell forwarding decisions per second. With an internal speed-up of two, delay performance of the optical ATM switch is close to that of an output-buffered switch.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE ATM Workshop Proceedings.

We consider the performance of blind techniques for a time-varying, fading, environment. The three techniques we investigate are Tong's (1994), subspace, and multiple survivor Viterbi methods due to their fast convergence and robustness to additive Gaussian noise. Their performance is compared with the non-blind cross-correlation scheme used in the GSM system. We also give the bit error rates (BER) in terms of the SNR after passing the resulting channel estimates from the three techniques to the Viterbi decoder. It is shown that both Tong's and the subspace methods outperform the multiple survivor Viterbi algorithm. Also, Tong's and subspace method show only a 5 dB loss in SNR as compared with the non-blind cross-correlation technique.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19980006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19980006","startPage":"27","endPage":"31","displayPublicationTitle":"6th IEE Conference on Telecommunications 1998 (Conf.

Coherent modulation combined with OFDM gives an optimum performance but needs a powerful channel estimator. We present a channel estimation method based on pilot symbols inserted both in time and frequency domains, and a linear interpolation algorithm. This linear interpolation algorithm has the advantage of minimising the system complexity and processing delay while giving a good approximation to the real mobile channel. The performance of the linear pilot aided estimation algorithm is compared to coherent modulation with perfect channel estimation as well as to differential modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"6th IEE Conference on Telecommunications 1998 (Conf.

The traffic in such networks is modelled by marked point processes that consist of two sequences of variables: the arrival times and the packet lengths. We propose a new traffic characterization, called g-regularity, to characterise a marked point process. Based on the new traffic characterizations, we introduce two basic network elements: (i) traffic regulators that generate g-regular marked point processes, and (ii) g-servers that provide QoS for marked point processes. Network elements can be joined by concatenation, \"filter bank summation\" and feedback to form a composite network element. We illustrate the use of the framework by various examples that include G/G/1 queues, VirtualClock, guaranteed rate servers in tandem, segmentation and reassembly, jitter control, dampers, window flow control, and queues with service curve-based earliest deadlines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1998","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6033352","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A general framework for deterministic service guarantees in telecommunication networks with variable length packets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general framework for deterministic service guarantees in telecommunication networks with variable length packets","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00675218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041138S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1998","isNumber":"14855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5540","citationCount":"4","articleId":"675218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":675239,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The powerful properties of GPS-based schemes translate easily into simple call admission control (CAC) procedures. The intense research on GPS has also resulted in very efficient implementation techniques, which have made the cost of these schedulers very affordable. The EDF discipline, in conjunction with per-node traffic shaping [which we refer to as rate-controlled EDF (RC-EDF)] has also been proposed for end-to-end QoS provisioning. However, an appropriate framework for CAC with RC-EDF has not been developed, nor the possible advantages of using RC-EDF in place of GPS have been properly characterized. Furthermore, the implementation complexity of an RC-EDF server is potentially very high, and no technique to reduce costs has been proposed. In this paper, we first formulate an end-to-end CAC framework for RC-EDF that can be implemented in practice. Then, using this framework, we numerically compare the schedulable regions of RC-EDF and GPS and show that, when the traffic mix in the network consists of connections with both stringent and loose delay requirements, RC-EDF can substantially outperform GPS in the number of admitted connections, and can thus achieve much higher network utilization. Finally, we propose a technique to substantially reduce the implementation complexity of a RC-EDF server.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 Sixth International Workshop on Quality of Service (IWQoS'98) (Cat.

In this paper, we assess the state-of-the-art in QoS adaptive wireless systems and argue for new adaptation techniques that are better suited to respond to application-specific adaptation needs. A QoS adaptive data link control model is presented that accounts for application-specific adaptation dynamics that include adaptation time scales and adaptation policies. A centralized adaptation controller employs a novel utility-fair bandwidth allocation scheme that supports the dynamic bandwidth needs of adaptive flows over a range of operating conditions. Three wireless service classes play an integral role in accommodating a wide variety of adaptation strategies. In this paper, we discuss the design of the utility-fair allocation scheme and the interaction between the centralized adaptation controller and a set of distributed adaptation handlers, which play a key role in intelligently responding to the time-varying channel capacity experienced over the air-interface.","doi":"10.1109/IWQOS.1998.675246","publicationTitle":"1998 Sixth International Workshop on Quality of Service (IWQoS'98) (Cat.

Previous work by Bourlard et al. (see Proc. Int. Conf. on Spoken Language Processing, Philadelphia, p.426-9, 1996) and Hermansky et al. (see Proc. Int. Conf. on Spoken Language Processing, Philadelphia, p.1579-82, 1996) suggests that multi-band ASR gives a more accurate recognition, especially in noisy acoustic environments, by combining the likelihoods of different frequency bands. Here we evaluate this likelihood recombination (LC) approach to multi-band ASR, and propose an alternative method, namely feature recombination (FC). In the FC system, after different acoustic analyzers are applied to each sub-band individually, a vector is composed by combining the sub-band features. The speech classifier then calculates the likelihood from the single vector. Thus, band-limited noise affects only a few of the feature components, as in the multi-band LC system, but, at the same time, all feature components are jointly modeled, as in conventional ASR. The experimental results show that the FC system can yield better performance than both the conventional ASR and the LC strategy for noisy speech.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6040004","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"Multi-band speech recognition in noisy environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-band speech recognition in noisy environments","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00675346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029221S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"51","articleId":"675346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":675347,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Shaobing Chen","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

If multi-variate Gaussian distributions are used to model the data then they must have full covariance matrices to accurately do so. This requires a large number of parameters per distribution which restricts the number of distributions that may be robustly estimated, particularly when high dimensional feature vectors are required. This paper describes an alternative to full covariance matrices in these situations. An approximate full covariance matrix is used. The covariance matrix is now split into two elements, one full and one diagonal, which may be tied at completely separate levels. Typically, the full elements are extensively tied, resulting in only a small increase in the number of parameters compared to the diagonal case. Thus dramatically increasing the number of distributions that may be robustly estimated. Simple iterative re-estimation formulae for all the parameters within the standard EM framework are presented. On a large vocabulary speech recognition task a 10% reduction in word error rate over a standard system was achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6040008","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"Semi-tied covariance matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-tied covariance matrices","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00675350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05005S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"12","articleId":"675350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":675351,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Sharing parameters across classes (or constraining the parameters) clearly tends to alleviate the first three problems. We show that in some cases it can also lead to better discrimination (as evidenced by reduced misclassification error). The parameters considered are the means and variances of the Gaussians and linear transformations of the feature space (or equivalently the Gaussian means). Some constraints on the parameters are shown to lead to linear discrimination analysis (a well-known result) while others are shown to lead to optimal feature spaces (a relatively new result). Applications of some of these ideas to the speech recognition problem are also given.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675351","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

While fully-expanded networks have been used before in restrictive settings (medium vocabulary or no cross-word contexts), we demonstrate that our network determination method makes it practical to use fully-expanded networks also in large-vocabulary recognition with full cross-word context modeling. For the DARPA North American Business News task (NAB), we give network sizes and recognition speeds and accuracies using bigram and trigram grammars with vocabulary sizes ranging from 10000 to 160000 words. With our construction, the fully-expanded NAB context-dependent networks contain only about twice as many arcs as the corresponding language models. Interestingly, we also find that, with these networks, real-time word accuracy is improved by increasing the vocabulary size and n-gram order.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Barnard (see Proceedings of the IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop, 1997) presented novel subspace distribution clustering hidden Markov models (SDCHMMs) which can be converted from continuous density hidden Markov models (CDHMMs) by clustering subspace Gaussians in each stream over all models. Though such model conversion is simple and runs fast, it has two drawbacks: (1) it does not take advantage of the fewer model parameters in SDCHMMs-theoretically SDCHMMs may be trained with smaller amount of data; and, (2) it involves two separate optimization steps (first training CDHMMs, then clustering subspace Gaussians) and the resulting SDCHMMs are not guaranteed to be optimal. We show how SDCHMMs may be trained directly from less speech data if we have a priori knowledge of their architecture. On the ATIS task, a speaker-independent, context-independent (CI) 20-stream SDCHMM system trained using our novel SDCHMM reestimation algorithm with only 8 minutes of speech performs as well as a CDHMM system trained using conventional CDHMM reestimation algorithm with 105 minutes of speech.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

We introduce an online paradigm which interleaves the estimation and application of a language model.

This principle is based on the recombination of several independent sub-recognizers, each one assigned to a specific frequency band. The major issue of such systems consists of deciding at which time the recombination must be done. Our algorithm lets each band be totally independent from the others, and uses the different solutions to resegment the initial sentence. Finally, the bands are synchronously merged together, according to this new segmentation. The whole system is too complex to be entirely described here, and, in this paper, we concentrate on the synchronous recombination part, which is achieved by a classifier. The system has been tested in clean and noisy environments, and proved to be especially robust to noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6040023","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A recombination model for multi-band speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recombination model for multi-band speech recognition","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00675365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027639S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"9","articleId":"675365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":675369,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Segmental feature vector normalization was found to improve the noise robustness of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) feature vectors and to outperform other state-of-the-art noise compensation techniques in speaker-dependent recognition. The objective of feature vector normalization is to provide environment-independent parameter statistics in all noise conditions. We propose a more efficient implementation approach for feature vector normalization where the normalization coefficients are computed in a recursive way. Speaker-dependent recognition experiments show that the recursive normalization approach obtains over 60%, the segmental method approximately 50%, and parallel model combination a 14% overall error rate reduction, respectively. Moreover, in the recursive case, this performance gain is obtained with the smallest implementation costs. Also in speaker-independent connected digit recognition, over a 16% error rate reduction is obtained with the proposed feature vector normalization approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6040027","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A recursive feature vector normalization approach for robust speech recognition in noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recursive feature vector normalization approach for robust speech recognition in noise","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00675369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051968S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"46","articleId":"675369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":675371,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Huo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Qiang Huo","id":"38521947900"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["Dialogue Systems Research Department, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Chin-Hui Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4428-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"675371","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Speech recognition","Testing","Bayesian methods","Acoustic distortion","Automatic speech recognition","Error analysis","Parameter estimation","Computer science","Natural languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","Bayes methods","prediction theory","pattern classification","maximum likelihood estimation","statistical analysis","Gaussian noise","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian predictive classification","robust speech recognition","prior sensitivity","distortions","BPC algorithm","prior distribution","model parameters","speech signal","performance","mismatch compensation","AWGN","MAP decision rule","parameter estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675371","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

The job of finding the distance between two distributions has been addressed with many solutions present in the literature. To cluster speakers using the pre-computed models of their speech, a need arises for computing a distance between these models which are normally built of a collection of distributions such as Gaussians (e.g., comparison between two HMM models). The definition of this distance measure creates many possibilities for speaker verification, speaker adaptation, speaker segmentation and many other related applications. A distance measure is presented for evaluating the closeness of a collection of distributions with centralized atoms such as Gaussians (but not limited to Gaussians). Several applications including some in speaker recognition with some results are presented using this distance measure.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675374","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

These phonetic questions are in fact phonetic categories such as vowels, plosives or fricatives. The assumption behind this is that context phonemes which belong to the same phonetic class have a similar influence on the pronunciation of a phoneme. For a new phoneme set, which has to be used, for example, when switching to a different corpus, a phonetic expert is needed to define proper phonetic questions. In this paper a new method is presented which automatically defines good phonetic questions for a phoneme set. This method uses the intermediate clusters from a phoneme clustering algorithm which are reduced to an appropriate number afterwards. Recognition results on the Wall Street Journal data for within-word and across-word phoneme models show competitive performance of the automatically generated questions with our best handcrafted question set.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675387","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

In particular, we study several LM look-ahead pruning techniques. Further, we improve the efficiency of this look-ahead technique by exploiting subtree dominance. This method avoids the computation of redundant subtrees within the copies of the lexical prefix tree and thus reduces the memory requirements of the search algorithm.

The compression algorithm can be used very effectively for speech recognition in network environments, such as those employing a client-server model, or to reduce storage in general speech recognition applications. The algorithm has also been tuned for practical implementations, so that the computational complexity and memory requirements are modest. We have successfully tested the compression algorithm against many test sets from several different languages, and the algorithm performed very well, with no significant change in the recognition accuracy due to compression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6033474","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compression of acoustic features for speech recognition in network environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of acoustic features for speech recognition in network environments","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00675430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024705S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"26","articleId":"675430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":675433,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We compare the performance and complexity of contextual hidden Markov models with a 'pause' model for ligatures. While the common contextual models lead to a word error rate reduction of 12.7%-38% at the cost of almost six times more character models, the pause model improves the word error rate by 15%-25% and adds only a single model to the recognition system.

The HMM and NN modules are typically treated as separate entities in a hybrid system. This paper, however, suggests that the a priori knowledge of the HMM structure can be beneficial in the design of the NN subsystem. A case of isolated word recognition is studied to demonstrate that a substantially simplified NN can be achieved in a structured HMM by applying a Bayesian factorization and pre-classification. The results indicate a similar performance to that obtained with the classical approach with much less complexity in the NN structure.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675464","pdfPath":"/iel4/5518/14874/00675464.pdf","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1116 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

The network is optimized using the maximum a posteriori technique, i.e., the cost function is the sum of the log-likelihood and a regularization term (prior). In order to perform robust classification, we present a modified likelihood function which incorporates the potential risk of outliers in the data. This leads to the introduction of a new parameter, the outlier probability. Designing the neural classifier involves optimization of network weights as well as outlier probability and regularization parameters. We suggest to adapt the outlier probability and regularisation parameters by minimizing the error on a validation set, and a simple gradient descent scheme is derived. In addition, the framework allows for constructing a simple outlier detector. Experiments with artificial data demonstrate the potential of the suggested framework.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675487","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

While often easy to implement, the convergence speed of gradient adaptation can be slow when the slope of the cost function varies widely for small changes in the parameters. In this paper, we outline an alternative technique, termed natural gradient adaptation, that overcomes the poor convergence properties of gradient adaptation in many cases. The natural gradient is based on differential geometry and employs knowledge of the Riemannian structure of the parameter space to adjust the gradient search direction. Unlike Newton's method, natural gradient adaptation does not assume a locally-quadratic cost function. Moreover, for maximum likelihood estimation tasks, natural gradient adaptation is asymptotically Fisher-efficient. A simple example illustrates the desirable properties of natural gradient adaptation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14874","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Four multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) were trained using the data from DMRT model. With the provision of an initial guess from snow hydrology prediction, neural networks effectively invert the snow parameters based on SSM/I measurements. In addition, a prediction neural network is used to achieve adaptive learning rates and a good initial estimate of snow depth for inversion.

It amounts to identifying pairs of corresponding pixels, one pixel in each image, that are associated with the same point on the 3-D world. We are introducing ART-1 neural networks as a primitive capable of addressing the stereo correspondence problem. Using a multi-pass approach it is possible to increase gradually the density of matched points, while at the same time false matches are filtered by requiring close agreement between disparity estimates in a neighborhood. At the end, a reasonably dense disparity map is obtained, to the extent that it allows the reconstruction of the scene using interpolation methods. Our scheme has been tested on stereograms, virtual world scenes generated by computer programs (where the \"ground truth\" is known) as well as real-world scenes.

The linguistic module employs a letter-to-sound neural network and postlexical neural network. The acoustic module employs a duration neural network and a phonetic neural network. The visual neural network is employed in parallel to the acoustic module to drive a talking head.

Three methods to detect fraud are presented. Firstly, a feed-forward neural network based on supervised learning is used to learn a discriminative function to classify subscribers using summary statistics. Secondly, a Gaussian mixture model is used to model the probability density of subscribers' past behavior so that the probability of current behavior can be calculated to detect any abnormalities from the past behavior. Lastly, Bayesian networks are used to describe the statistics of a particular user and the statistics of different fraud scenarios. The Bayesian networks can be used to infer the probability of fraud given the subscribers' behavior. The data features are derived from toll tickets. The experiments show that the methods detect over 85% of the fraudsters in our testing set without causing false alarms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675496/","accessionNumber":"6040112","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fraud detection in communication networks using neural and probabilistic methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fraud detection in communication networks using neural and probabilistic methods","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00675496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05492S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"28","articleId":"675496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":675572,"authors":[{"name":"T.O.

The liquid functions both as an electrical insulation and as a heat transfer fluid. The liquid in almost all of these units is transformer oil, petroleum-based insulating oil refined specifically to meet the requirements of this application. Transformers in electric power distribution and transmission systems are expected to function reliably and efficiently and to do this for many years. The quality of the oil in a transformer plays an important role in performing this function, and the characteristics of transformer oil have been examined and reported on for decades. This article discusses some of these characteristics and the relationships between these characteristics and the production and in-service performance of mineral transformer oil.

The goal is to find the solution that satisfies the product goals. The architecture team must invent and refine the design until it converges on an implementable architecture.

Typically, the input to a collision detection algorithm is a large number of geometric objects comprising an environment, together with a set of objects moving within the environment. In addition to determining accurately the contacts that occur between pairs of objects, one needs also to do so at real-time rates. Applications such as haptic force feedback can require over 1000 collision queries per second. We develop and analyze a method, based on bounding-volume hierarchies, for efficient collision detection for objects moving within highly complex environments. Our choice of bounding volume is to use a discrete orientation polytope (k-DOP), a convex polytope whose facets are determined by halfspaces whose outward normals come from a small fixed set of k orientations. We compare a variety of methods for constructing hierarchies (BV-trees) of bounding k-DOPs. Further, we propose algorithms for maintaining an effective BV-tree of k-DOPs for moving objects, as they rotate, and for performing fast collision detection using BV-trees of the moving objects and of the environment. Our algorithms have been implemented and tested. We provide experimental evidence showing that our approach yields substantially faster collision detection than previous methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan-Mar 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan-Mar 1998","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-March 1998","accessionNumber":"5921227","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Efficient collision detection using bounding volume hierarchies of k-DOPs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient collision detection using bounding volume hierarchies of k-DOPs","sourcePdf":"00675649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0904S","chronDate":"Jan-Mar 1998","isNumber":"14872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"442","articleId":"675649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":675715,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The sensitivity analysis can be used to measure the loss in accuracy along the computational chain, to characterize the tolerated perturbations, and to dimension the whole architecture.","doi":"10.1109/12.675715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/12/14873/00675715.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.675715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=675715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy vs. precision in digital VLSI architectures for signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/675715/","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy vs. precision in digital VLSI architectures for signal processing","volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5915500","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy vs. precision in digital VLSI architectures for signal processing","sourcePdf":"00675715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05923S","chronDate":"Apr 1998","isNumber":"14873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","articleId":"675715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":675719,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Nung Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Nung Yang","id":"37279103900"},{"name":"Chi-Sung Laih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Sung Laih","id":"37353921300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"675719","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tail","Error correction codes","Information rates","Very large scale integration","Programmable logic arrays","Shift registers","Hamming weight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error detection codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC/sub m/ codes","t-EC/AUED codes","error correction codes","errror detection codes","codeword"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=675719","abstract":"A common method for constructing t-error correcting/all unidirectional error detecting (t-EC/AUED) codes is to append a tail to t-EC code, where the tail is a function of the weight of the codeword.

Femtosecond lasers emitting in the wavelength range around 1 /spl mu/m are attractive sources for a variety of applications. At 1.06 /spl mu/m, neodymium-doped glass offers both the relatively broad gain bandwidth, which is necessary for femtosecond pulse generation, and a strong absorption band around 800 nm, which allows for direct diode-pumping. Femtosecond pulses from diode-pumped Nd:glass lasers were previously reported, using intracavity semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAMs) to obtain mode-locking. In these lasers prism pairs were used for compensation of intracavity material dispersion and of self-phase modulation, limiting the reliability and compactness of the systems. Towards more compact and reliable femtosecond lasers we demonstrate a SESAM-mode-locked Nd:silicate laser, which uses Gires-Tournois interferometer mirrors for dispersion compensation and which is pumped by only a single laser diode.","doi":"10.1109/CLEO.1998.675991","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

We describe a new type of coherent red light source which has the potential of low cost, high efficiency and multiwatt output powers. Red light was generated by sum frequency mixing of the outputs of a high-power Er/Yb co-doped fiber (EYDF) amplifier pumped by a 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser. The 9-m-long, single-mode EYDF copropagating amplifier had a gain peak near 1535 nm and was seeded by a laser diode. The fiber amplifier served as an efficient power converter of the 1064-nm pump light into 1.5-/spl mu/m emission. To generate sum frequency, the 1535 and 1064 nm radiation emerging from the angle-cleaved output end of the amplifier was focused directly into a nonlinear crystal using a dichroic lens. Two fiber polarization controllers were used to achieve polarization at both wavelengths, which was linear and parallel to the crystal c-axis. A 2.2-cm-long LiNbO/sub 3/ crystal was periodically poled to obtain a domain period of 11.2 /spl mu/m, calculated to produce sum frequency generation quasi-phase matching near 120/spl deg/C.","doi":"10.1109/CLEO.1998.676227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEO.1998.676227","startPage":"323","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

This is accomplished via modularized sensitive skin patches that can be connected in various ways, and a hierarchical control architecture that can be easily modified for various system configurations. In the implemented version, the skin contains about 1000 infrared sensors; it can be easily expanded, with minor changes.

One way of reducing the size of the electronic hardware is through three-dimensional (3-D) packaging at the chip level. This approach reduces the length of the chip-to-chip interconnects by placing the neighboring chips in very close proximity to each other. Each chip in the stack communicates with its neighbors via electrical interconnects. Free-space optics provide the much-needed low-power global high-density interconnects to communicate between stacks. We show a schematic view of multiple 3-D electronic chip stacks interconnected via free-space optoelectronics. An array of microlasers and detectors are attached to each stack. The stacks communicate between each other via micro-optical components. 3-D packaging allows the overall system size to be small.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chip-level three-dimensional stacking for free-space optical interconnects","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

From a viewpoint of practical applications, however, it turns out, we found, to have some performance limitations such as unrealistically high torque due to joint angle limit constraints and tracking errors due to joint torque limit constraints under parameter variation and disturbance. Remedying the limitations, the enhanced compact QP method is developed by using the practical inequality constraints with p-step-ahead predictor and time delay estimation. Through dynamic simulation results, it is verified that the enhanced compact QP method significantly improves the compact QP method in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for the real-time control of redundant manipulators under physical limits.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1998.676327","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

The robot has complex, animal-like kinematics with 24 degrees of freedom, yet the controller effectively manages its posture despite large perturbations. The algorithm is also computationally efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1998.676348","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

Although the cascadability of several all-optical wavelength converters (AOWC) will be an important issue, to our knowledge there is only one study dealing with the cascadability of more than two AOWCs based on cross-gain modulation (XGM) in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). In this study, only signal characteristics were addressed. However, investigations of the cascadability require analysis of signal as well as noise characteristics, because both determine the resulting bit error rate (BER). In this paper, the transmission of both the input signal and noise are investigated analytically. This is used to estimate the BER performance and the cascadability of AOWCs based on XGM at 2.5 Gbits/s. The evaluation is based on the theory used to calculate the output probe power, as a function of the input powers, and the wavelengths.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEO.1998.676359","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

Recently, there has been tremendous interest in applying spread spectrum and code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques in optical fiber communication systems. Contrary to radio CDMA systems, which employs electric-field encoding and correlation to achieve orthogonality, most of the optical communication systems use intensity modulation and direct detection. To achieve true orthogonality in optical CDMA systems, the balanced detection scheme and spectral intensity coding need to be used. We shows the block diagram of the bipolar spectrally encoded CDMA system. The transmitter consists of a pair of broadband optical sources connected in a balanced fashion. The input data differentially modulate the intensity of the two balanced sources.","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

The wavelength converter has been considered to be one of the key devices in wavelength division-multiplexed (WDM) systems because it allows reuse of wavelengths, thus avoiding wavelength channel contention and giving more flexibility to the systems. Although several wavelength converters exist, problems such as insufficient conversion efficiency and critical operating conditions have prevented them from being widely deployed. In this paper, we describe a type of semiconductor wavelength converter with compact size and better conversion characteristics. The newly proposed wavelength converter utilizes coupled semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) and has a very simple structure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEO.1998.676519","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

Previous demonstrations of self-synchronization have involved marker pulses at different wavelengths, polarization, intensity, or bit period.

In a chirped-pulse amplification laser chain, as the spectral phase added by the stretcher and the group-velocity dispersion in all the materials is imperfectly compensated by the compressor, the output pulse is distorted by the residual phase, and its duration and contrast are not optimal. There is thus a need for an efficient characterization of the pulses in order to optimize the system or control a programmable spectral phase modulator. Spectral shearing interferometry is demonstrated as a powerful technique for measuring the amplitude and phase of ultrashort optical pulses. Its implementation is simple, and the phase retrieval from the data is straightforward.","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

This methodology is based on a generic architecture utilising time interleaved coefficients for the wavelet transform filters. The architecture is scaleable and it has been parameterised in terms of wavelet family, wavelet type, data word length and coefficient word length. The control circuit is designed in such a way that the cores can also be cascaded without any interface glue logic for any desired level of decomposition. This parameterisation allows the use of any orthonormal wavelet family, thereby extending the design space for improved transformation from algorithm to silicon. Case studies for stand alone and cascaded silicon cores for single and multi stage analysis respectively are reported. The typical design time to produce silicon layout of a wavelet based system has been reduced by an order of magnitude. The cores are comparable in area and performance to hand crafted designs. The designs have been captured in VHDL so they are portable across a range of foundries and are also applicable to FPGA and PLD implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid design of discrete orthonormal wavelet transforms","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Neural Network II further reduces the residual noise level, and calculates the final angular acceleration estimate. As an illustrative example, we discuss the application of our scheme in the elevator velocity and acceleration signal acquisition. Two different kinds of neural network models are employed: the back-propagation neural network (BP) and the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

The novelty lies in combining a fully analytical procedure for the design (including thermal constraints) with a genetic algorithm procedure in order to optimise an objective function, as the motor efficiency or the material cost or some other motor figures or a combination of them. The motor design procedure consists of a system of nonlinear equations which imposes PM characteristics, motor performance, magnetic stresses and thermal limits. Taking advantage of the analytical form of the design procedure, the optimisation technique based on genetic algorithms has been readily implemented. An optimised design is included in the paper, as well as a comparison between the proposed optimisation technique and that based on the classical climbing-hill direct-search method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/676937/","accessionNumber":"5731077","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Brushless DC motor design: an optimisation procedure based on genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brushless DC motor design: an optimisation procedure based on genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"00676937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038555S","chronDate":"1-3 Sep 1997","isNumber":"14907","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5573","citationCount":"28","articleId":"676937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":676938,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Random sampling is an equivalent sampling technique which measures waveforms using a finer time resolution compared to the sampling period. Random sampling is usually applied for digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs). Its design does not require delay lines for introducing the time shift for the measured signals, and theoretically, it is able to measure very-wide-band signals. However, partial waveform missing phenomenon will occur if interference between the trigger signals and hold-off (HO=trigger-enable) signals exists. One of the mechanisms already reported for the phenomenon is where the trigger periods are shorter than those of the sampling periods. Some dithers were added to hold-off signals to eliminate the interference. We call this method the random hold-off method (RHM). In this paper, we introduce the second mechanism where the trigger signals are not evenly divided by hold-off signals. Unexpectedly, RHM has a good effect on the second mechanism. However, we propose a rational countermeasure with no dither to avoid both mechanisms. Our proposed countermeasure controls the timing of the hold-off signals using the data which was measured during a series of acquisitions. We call it the constant hold-off method (CHM). CHM makes it possible to design a low-display-noise and wide-band DSOs because dither produces intermodulation. In a simulation, the waveform acquisition time of CHM is about two-thirds that of RHM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/676962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6090483","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Waveform missing mechanisms and a countermeasure in a random sampling system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform missing mechanisms and a countermeasure in a random sampling system","confLoc":"St. Paul, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00676962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029446S","chronDate":"18-21 May 1998","isNumber":"14915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5565","citationCount":"3","articleId":"676962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":676963,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

The method does not require a time-base error model and thus provides accurate estimates where model-based methods fail. Measurements of sinewaves at multiple phases and frequencies are used as test signals. A harmonic distortion model is used to account for amplitude nonlinearity of the sampling channel. Use of an independent method for estimating the channel noise and jitter allows an accurate estimate of the harmonic order. Methods are presented for separating the harmonics generated by the sampling channel from those generated by the time-base distortion. The use of an iterative sine-fit procedure gives accurate results in a short time. A new weighting procedure is described, which minimizes the error in the estimates.

The different types of faults are further analyzed to failure-initiators, contributors and underlying causes. The results have been compared with those of a previous survey by these authors, and one by an IEEE Report. Methods of fault detection are reviewed and analyzed: mechanical (vibrations, shock pulses, acoustic, speed fluctuations), electro mechanical (currents, surges, partial discharges, leakage fluxes) and temperature-, oil particle-, gas, analysis, and performance- and visual methods. Different types of fault generate different frequency components in vibration spectra, in motor supply current, in torque and in magnetic field, and relationships between fault types and spectra have been studied.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19971048","publicationTitle":"1997 Eighth International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

A modified output re-definition approach is utilized to overcome the problem caused by the non-minimum phase characteristic of the flexible-link system. This modification is based on using minimum a priori knowledge about the system dynamics. The modified output redefinition approach requires a priori knowledge about the linear model of the system and no a priori knowledge about the payload mass. Four different neural network schemes are proposed. The neural networks are trained and employed as online controllers. The four proposed neural network controllers are implemented on a single flexible-link experimental test-bed. Experimental and simulation results are presented to illustrate the advantages and improved performance of the proposed tip position tracking controllers over conventional PD-type controllers in the presence of unmodeled dynamics.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1998.677084","pdfPath":"/iel4/5562/14892/00677084.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"811 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

Two classes of waveform are described: least-current and smooth-torque. The least current waveforms neglect torque ripple, whilst the smooth-torque waveforms eliminate torque ripple. The new classes of waveform are contrasted with the conventional single-pulse and chopping waveforms. Of particular importance is the medium speed smooth-torque, waveform that has a lower RMS current and a similar peak current to its chopping counter part. Thus it is possible to increase the mean torque produced by the SRM and simultaneously smooth its torque production, without increasing the electronics VA rating.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19971098","publicationTitle":"1997 Eighth International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

This is particularly true when the reluctance motors are excited by currents which are synchronized with the rotor position, as is the case in this paper. The doubly salient reluctance motor, with position-synchronised excitation, is commonly referred to as a switched reluctance motor (SRM). The paper compares a singly salient reluctance motor (SSRM), an SRM and an 'off-the-shelf induction motor' (IM). Every attempt has been made to make this comparison 'fair'. All three motors have the same cooling, use the same frame, have the same temperature rise, use the same air gap and use the same steel. The paper concludes that both of the reluctance motors have superior performance to the IM and that the SRM has superior performance to the SSRM. The comparison is for D80 sized motors with a nominal top speed of 1500 RPM.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19971099","pdfPath":"/iel4/5573/14907/00677147.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"365","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Eighth International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

A single figure of merit, for a given design, is identified that effectively determines what the best available working power factor may be. The same figure of merit is applicable to synchronous machines of conventional configuration, so that comparison can be made between VRPM and conventional machines and the fundamental reasons for their difference in working power factor understood. The scope for power factor improvement in VRPM machines can then be examined, by changing the electromagnetic design so as to modify the figure of merit appropriately. However, it will become clear that a very limited amount of improvement is possible, and low working power factor seems to be the price that must be paid for the high specific output.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=677152","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power factor","transverse-flux machines","variable reluctance permanent magnet motors","figure of merit","synchronous machines","power factor improvement","electromagnetic design","low working power factor","stator flux distribution","rotor flux distribution"]}],"publicationTitle":"1997 Eighth International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

II. Visual control aspects","abstract":"During a conventional colonoscopy examination, the endoscopist watches a video monitor that displays the real-time images being captured by a CCD camera at the distal end of the colonoscope. Some researchers believe that a computer can be used to interpret these images and be trained to recognize and correctly locate the position of the lumen. This information will then be processed and used to control and maneuver the colonoscope automatically into the colon. It can also be used to identify abnormalities of the large intestine. This article presents a literature survey that gives a critical review of research in the area of visual control in automated colonoscopy. It is concluded that, generally, the idea of using computer vision to aid in the automation of colonoscopy is meritorious. However, it is important for one to realize the vast differences in physical attributes of the colon. No two colons are similar. Even within the same colon, one section may portray very different characteristics from another. Since technology is not yet at the stage where computers can think in the same way as do human beings, computerized visual control in colonoscopy may not be realized for some time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1998","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1998","accessionNumber":"5933970","pubMedId":"9604705","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automation of colonoscopy.

The reasons for this are that prefetches interfere with normal cache operations by making cache address and data ports busy, the memory bus busy, the memory banks busy, and by not necessarily being complete by the time that the prefetched data is actually referenced. In this paper, we present extensive quantitative results of a detailed cycle-by-cycle trace-driven simulation of a uniprocessor memory system in which we vary most of the relevant parameters in order to determine when and if hardware prefetching is useful. We find that, in order for prefetching to actually improve performance, the address array needs to be double ported and the data array needs to either be double ported or fully buffered. It is also very helpful for the bus to be very wide (e.g., 16 bytes) for bus transactions to be split and for main memory to be interleaved. Under the best circumstances, i.e., with a significant investment in extra hardware, prefetching can significantly improve performance. For implementations without adequate hardware, prefetching often decreases performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/12/14889/00677225.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.677225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.677225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=677225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CPU cache prefetching: Timing evaluation of hardware implementations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Timing","Hardware","Cache memory","Central Processing Unit","Investments","Memory architecture","Delay","System performance","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","storage management","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CPU caches","hardware implementations","cache miss ratio","CPU performance","cache operations","cycle-by-cycle trace-driven simulation","uniprocessor memory system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","displayDocTitle":"CPU cache prefetching: Timing evaluation of hardware implementations","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5942200","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CPU cache prefetching: Timing evaluation of hardware implementations","sourcePdf":"00677225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07606S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","articleId":"677225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":677251,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

In their method, both modules perform identical computation except when the algorithm is in a \"branching\" [1]. We have improved the algorithm and show that it is possible to perform two circular mode rotations in a single step, with little additional hardware. In our method, both modules perform distinct computations at each step which leads to a better utilization of the hardware and the possibility of further speedup over the original method.

The homography between some planar feature points extracted from two images (corresponding to the current and desired camera poses) is computed at each iteration. Then, an approximate partial-pose, where the translational term is known only up to a scale factor, is deduced, from which can be designed a closed-loop control law controlling the six camera DOF. Contrarily to the position-based visual servoing, our scheme does not need any geometric 3D model of the object. Furthermore and contrarily to the image-based visual servoing, our approach ensures the convergence of the control law in all the task space.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1998.677293","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

We show that the trained network provides good estimate of the exact solution to the kinematics of each module. Moreover, this indirect approach allows us to efficiently project the practical limits on the displacement of actuators onto the backbone-curve posture. This feature of the proposed approach is very attractive for the real-time configuration control and motion planning of a VGT manipulator, that comprises a large number of parallel modules connected in series.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677396/","accessionNumber":"5966166","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-20 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast estimation of the kinematics of the parallel modules of a variable-geometry-truss manipulator using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast estimation of the kinematics of the parallel modules of a variable-geometry-truss manipulator using neural networks","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"00677396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032663S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1998","isNumber":"14899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562","articleId":"677396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":677399,"authors":[{"name":"Di Xiao","affiliation":["FANUC Robotics North America, Inc., Rochester Hills, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Di Xiao","id":"38135647500"},{"name":"B.K.

The task under consideration is to control a robot such that a tool grasped by the end-effector of the robot follows a path on an unknown surface with the aid of a single camera vision system. To accomplish the task, we propose a new planning and control strategy based on multisensor fusion. Three different sensors-joint encoders, a wrist force-torque sensor and a vision system with a single camera fixed above a workspace-are employed. We decouple control variables into two sub-spaces: one is for force control and the other for control of constrained motion. We also develop a new scheme by means of sensor fusion to handle the uncertainties in an uncalibrated workspace. The contact surface is assumed to be unknown and the precise position and orientation of the camera with respect to the robot is also unknown.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1998.677399","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

Therefore the model is computationally efficient. The stability of the network is analytically proved using a Lyapunov function candidate.

Building on our previous success in developing optimization-based scheduling methods using Lagrangian relaxation for practical applications, this paper presents a novel Lagrangian relaxation neural network (LRNN) optimization technique. The convergence of LRNN for separable convex programming problems is established. For separable integer programming problems, LRNN is constructed to obtain near optimal solution in an efficient manner. When applying LRNN to separable job shop scheduling, a new neural dynamic programming method is developed to solve subproblems making innovative use of the dynamic programming structure. The synergy of Lagrangian relaxation and neural dynamic programming leads to a powerful neural optimization method for job shop scheduling. Testing results obtained by software simulation demonstrate that the performance is superior to what has been reported in the neural network literature. Results are also very close to what were obtained by a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm, and should be much improved when the method is refined and implemented in hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677428/","accessionNumber":"5966189","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-20 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Lagrangian relaxation neural networks for job shop scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lagrangian relaxation neural networks for job shop scheduling","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"00677428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074032S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1998","isNumber":"14899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562","citationCount":"3","articleId":"677428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":677598,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The transmission operation is traditionally characterized by its traditional transfer function. Using a Thevenin source, the transfer function may be scaled to become the absolute radiation efficiency. Transmission lines are accurately modeled, and a matched impedance design is recommended. The reception operation also is characterized by its traditional transfer function. However, reception sensitivity is defined as the signal-to-noise ratio achieved by the combined transducer, transmission line, and preamplifier. The thermal noise arises from the media and other noise sources contributed by the transducer, transmission line, and preamplifier. An absolute sensitivity measure is defined as the acoustic noise figure, which is the sum of individual transducer and preamplifier noise figures. The transducer noise figure is independent of the receiver load impedance and depends critically on dissipative loss. Preamplifier noise figure performance requires noise matching to the transducer. High performance design methods are presented that incorporate transmission lines, which include loss. Modeled examples are used to demonstrate performance.","doi":"10.1109/58.677600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/14911/00677600.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.677600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14911","startPage":"559","endPage":"566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing ultrasonic transducers using radiation efficiency and reception noise figure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=677600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing ultrasonic transducers using radiation efficiency and reception noise figure","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5950180","pubMedId":"18244207","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing ultrasonic transducers using radiation efficiency and reception noise figure","sourcePdf":"00677600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043123S","chronDate":"May  1998","isNumber":"14911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"14","articleId":"677600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":677610,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To increase contrast between these agents and tissue, nonlinear methods such as harmonic imaging can be used. Contrast is limited, however, by tissue second harmonic signals. We show that a major source of this signal is nonlinear propagation through tissue. In addition, we present methods to suppress this second harmonic generation. One simple approach is to decrease the f/number of the imaging system. Simulations show that doubling the size of the array, while keeping total power output constant, decreases propagating second harmonic generation. A second approach uses active noise cancellation to suppress second harmonic generation. A specific method, the harmonic cancellation system (HCS), is developed and presented as an example. In simulations, HCS decreased second harmonic generation by over 30 dB. Using such methods, contrast can be improved between tissue and bubbles in harmonic imaging.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Frequency conversion","Transducers","Noise cancellation","Phased arrays","Backscatter","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Signal restoration","Blood flow","Fluid flow measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics","ultrasonic imaging","backscatter","biomedical ultrasonics","blood flow measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagating second harmonic","ultrasound contrast imaging","contrast agents","backscatter","nonlinear methods","harmonic imaging","nonlinear propagation","total power output","active noise cancellation","harmonic cancellation system","bubbles"]}],"doi":"10.1109/58.677614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/14911/00677614.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.677614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of propagating second harmonic in ultrasound contrast imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=677614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of propagating second harmonic in ultrasound contrast imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677614/","volume":"45","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5950194","pubMedId":"18244221","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of propagating second harmonic in ultrasound contrast imaging","sourcePdf":"00677614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037998S","chronDate":"May  1998","isNumber":"14911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"59","articleId":"677614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":677615,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is compared with the conical transducer, which also gives an approximate limited-diffraction solution to the wave equation. The conical transducer's field deviates from the predicted field in the nearfield, where it is wider. Therefore, the Bessel beam is better for use in a hybrid system where a limited-diffraction beam is used for transmission and a dynamically focused beam for reception. The limited-diffraction Bessel beam of order zero can be excited on an annular transducer with equal-area division of elements and with a fixed prefocus, i.e., conventional transducers used in commercial medical imaging equipment. The element division implies that the scaling parameter must be chosen to contain the first lobe of the Bessel function in the first element. In addition, the prefocus must be such that the array is steerable to infinite depth with minor loss. Even when the Bessel beam yields a larger depth of field than that of an unfocused transducer, it has the advantage of a narrower beam. Simulated examples are shown where the approximate Bessel beam compares favorably with a spherically focused beam with a fixed focus, an unfocused beam, and a conical transducer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1998","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5950195","pubMedId":"18244222","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Bessel and conical beams and approximation with annular arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bessel and conical beams and approximation with annular arrays","sourcePdf":"00677615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039537S","chronDate":"May  1998","isNumber":"14911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"39","articleId":"677615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":677685,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

The movement of the object is determined from a field with spatial oscillations in both the axial direction of the transducer and in one or two directions transverse to the axial direction. By using a number of pulse emissions, the inter-pulse movement can be estimated and the velocity found from the estimated movement and the time between pulses. The method is based on the principle of using transverse spatial modulation for making the received signal influenced by transverse motion. Such a transverse modulation can be generated by using apodization on individual transducer array elements together with a special focusing scheme. A method for making such a field is presented along with a suitable two-dimensional velocity estimator. An implementation usable in medical ultrasound is described, and simulated results are presented. Simulation results for a flow of 1 m/s in a tube rotated in the image plane at specific angles (0, 15, 35, 55, 75, and 90 degrees) are made and characterized by the estimated mean value, estimated angle, and the standard deviation in the lateral and longitudinal direction. The average performance of the estimates for all angles is: mean velocity 0.99 m/s, longitudinal S.D. 0.015 m/s, and lateral S.D. 0.196 m/s. For flow parallel to the transducer the results are: mean velocity 0.95 m/s, angle 0.10, longitudinal S.D. 0.020 m/s, and lateral S.D. 0.172 m/s.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.677749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14911","startPage":"837","endPage":"851","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/14911/00677749.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for estimation of velocity vectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1998","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new method for estimation of velocity vectors","publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5950209","pubMedId":"18244236","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for estimation of velocity vectors","sourcePdf":"00677749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073968S","chronDate":"May  1998","isNumber":"14911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"337","articleId":"677749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":677757,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

A novel technique, called \"spatial quadrature,\" for the simultaneous estimation of axial and lateral velocity components is introduced. This technique utilizes even and odd spatial weightings of the point spread function that have a quandrature relationship. These weightings produce modulation in the received echo that can be decoded to quantify lateral motion. This estimator can be implemented for two-dimensional velocity estimation with a conventional transducer array and medical ultrasound scanner, preferably one with parallel receive processing. The technique also can be extended to three-dimensional velocity estimation given an appropriate 2-D transducer and scanner architecture. Discussed are space and frequency domain descriptions of this estimator in the context of a brief overview of 2-D flow estimation methods, including analyses characterizing the performance envelope of this estimator. In addition, the application of this technique in CW and PW regimes, and with both radio frequency and baseband quadrature (I- and-Q) data, are discussed. Phantom studies demonstrate spatial quadrature in 2-D using a clinical scanner.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/14911/00677757.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.677757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.677757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=677757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-dimensional velocity estimation with ultrasound using spatial quadrature","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Frequency estimation","Biomedical transducers","Ultrasonic transducers","Motion estimation","Decoding","Ultrasonic transducer arrays","Frequency domain analysis","Performance analysis","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood flow measurement","biomedical ultrasonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-dimensional velocity estimation","parallel receive processing","spatial quadrature","blood flow","point spread function","echo modulation","transducer array","medical ultrasound scanner"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/677757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1998","displayDocTitle":"Multi-dimensional velocity estimation with ultrasound using spatial quadrature","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5950210","pubMedId":"18244237","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-dimensional velocity estimation with ultrasound using spatial quadrature","sourcePdf":"00677757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042707S","chronDate":"May  1998","isNumber":"14911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"144","articleId":"677757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":677984,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The focus, however, is on adaptive system designs with limited training data sets and low computational optimization complexity. In this context, the target vector is equipped with a carefully selected orthogonal auxiliary vector for disturbance suppression with one complex space-time degree of freedom. Direct generalization leads to adaptive generation of a sequence of conditionally optimized weighted auxiliary vectors that are orthogonal to each other and to the target vector of interest. This approach appears here for the first time. Adaptive disturbance suppression with any desired number of complex degrees of freedom below the data dimension is therefore possible. It is shown that processing with multiple auxiliary vectors falls under well known blocking-matrix processing principles. The proposed blocking matrix, however, is data dependent, adaptively generated, and no data eigen analysis is involved. While the issues treated refer to general adaptive detection procedures, the presentation is given in the context of joint space-time adaptive processing for array radars.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint domain space-time adaptive processing with small training data sets","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Radar Conference, RADARCON'98.

The interpolative vector quantizer maps quantized low dimensional 2/spl times/2 image blocks to higher dimensional 4/spl times/4 blocks by a table lookup method. As a special case of generalized vector quantization (GVQ), a jointly optimal quantizer and interpolator (GIVQ) is introduced to find the corresponding code books for the low and high resolution image. In order to incorporate the nearest neighborhood constraint on the quantizer and also to obtain the desired distortion in the interpolated image, a deterministic annealing based optimization technique has been applied. With a small interpolation example, we demonstrate the superior performance of this method over nonlinear interpolative vector quantization (NLIVQ), in which the interpolator is optimized for a given input quantizer.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.678069","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

In order to reduce the quantity of bits needed to store images and, consequently, increase their transmission velocity, many coding methods have been studied, especially those which utilize transforms. This paper presents an image compression technique that codes edges and textures separately using the wavelet transform. Several test images have been coded with the proposed method and the results show that the reconstructed images have good performance in relation to their PSNR and, especially, in terms of visual perception.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

A prior knowledge of the manufactured object shadow shape is described by a prototype template and a set of admissible linear transformations to take into account the shape variability. Then, the classification problem is defined as a two step process; firstly the detection problem of a region of interest in the input image is stated in a Bayesian framework and is posed as an equivalent energy minimization problem of an objective function: in this paper, this energy minimization problem is solved by using a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA). Secondly, the value of this function at convergence allows one to determine the presence of the desired object in the sonar image. This method has been successfully tested on real and synthetic sonar images, yielding very promising results.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.678090","startPage":"2741","endPage":"2744 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

We propose a set of measures to evaluate image stabilization algorithms based of their fidelity, displacement range, and performance. These measures do not require calibration or ground truth, making the evaluation procedure very simple and flexible, i.e., it provides the means to compare techniques based on different motion models. We have used this procedure to compare several image stabilization algorithms and also evaluate the sensitivity of these algorithms to some of its parameters. These same procedures could also be used for the comparison and evaluation of motion estimation and image registration techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.678102","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Motion estimation is the most computationally demanding part of video compression algorithms and hence usually requires hardware support for real-time implementation. However, dedicated hardware usually requires that the algorithm and most of its parameters be hardwired. Reconfigurable hardware based on FPGAs allows the parallelism of hardware implementations with the flexibility of software. The statistics of motion vectors can be monitored on a frame by frame basis to choose appropriate algorithm and hardware configurations. Unlike some proposed applications of dynamic reconfiguration, this rate can easily be supported by existing FPGA technology. Another novel aspect of this work is that we use power savings as a motivation for the reconfiguration. Although FPGAs are not a very power efficient technology; careful design of array architectures can allow power to be saved by avoiding unnecessary computation by adjusting the search area according to the changing characteristics of an input video signal. Another more general result is that further power saving can be achieved by utilizing free FPGA resources as local memory to avoid power-hungry off-chip communication. Practical implementation issues using Xilinx 6200 series FPGAs are also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfiguration for power saving in real-time motion estimation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

This paper considers software-based implementation of RS codecs where special instructions are assumed to be used to program finite field multiplication datapaths inside a domain-specific programmable digital-signal processor (DS-PDSP). A heterogeneous digit-serial approach is presented, where the heterogeneity corresponds to the use of different digit-sizes in the multiply-accumulate (MAC for polynomial multiplication) and degree reduction (DEGRED for polynomial module operation) subarrays. The salient feature of this digit-serial approach is that only the digit-cells are implemented in hardware, the finite field multiplications are performed digit-serially in software by dynamically scheduling the internal digit-level operations in RS encoders and decoders. It is concluded that, for 2-error-correcting RS(n,k) codec implementations over finite field GF(2/sup 8/), a parallel MAC unit (of digit-size 8) and a DEGRED unit with digit-size 2 is the best datapath, with respect to least energy consumption and energy-delay products. With this datapath architecture and appropriate digit-serial scheduling strategies, more than 60% energy reduction and more than 1/3 energy delay reduction can be achieved compared with the parallel multiplication datapath based approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678169/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 1998","volume":"5","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6061835","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1998","displayDocTitle":"Low-energy heterogeneous digit-serial Reed-Solomon codecs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-energy heterogeneous digit-serial Reed-Solomon codecs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00678169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029874S","chronDate":"12-15 May 1998","isNumber":"14897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5518","citationCount":"6","articleId":"678169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":678190,"authors":[{"name":"I.

However, the applicability of all techniques proposed until now are limited to digital data and they either implicitly or explicitly exploit the imperfection of human perception to audio and video. We propose the first watermarking technique for protecting the intellectual property of DSP designs. The essence of the technique is the use of additional synthesis constraints to encode the authorship signature. The constraints are selected in such a way that they result in minimal hardware overhead while embedding the signature which is unique and difficult to detect and remove. The technique is applicable to all levels of design process, from the algorithm, system and behavioral synthesis to logic synthesis and physical design levels. The technique is illustrated on a set of DSP design examples on all levels of the design process.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.678190","startPage":"3133","endPage":"3136 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

The chip is capable of coping with a with range of applications and thus provides the system designer with great flexibility.

Since the OFDM system can be considered as a set of parallel gaussian channels with different frequency gain for each subcarrier, we apply the theory of sample mean to each subcarrier by averaging the consecutive data symbols. Assuming the channel attenuations and the transmitted data symbols are constant while taking averages, this effectively removes noise and we can obtain the data symbols distorted only by the multipath channel. The proposed method does not require any a priori knowledge about the channel statistics. Furthermore, it has the performance improvement over conventional schemes even for slowly time-varying channels. We evaluate the equalizer through simulation using a 16 QAM OFDM system.

The technique designs on the impulse responses of the analysis filters directly. The design problem is formulated as an optimization program. The filter bank's PR feature can either be implicitly enforced through a set of mathematical relationships among the analysis filters' coefficients or through a set of constraints in the optimization program. The former approach results in a filter bank whose PR feature's dependency on hardware and software is eliminated or, at least, minimized. The synthesis filters are then obtained by a set of relationships that describe each synthesis filter as a function of the analysis filters. The criterion for optimality is \"least-squares,\" where the square of the difference between the ideal and actual frequency responses is integrated over the appropriate frequency bands for all M analysis filters and minimized.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14942/00678467.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.678467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.678467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to the design of critically sampled M-channel uniform-band perfect-reconstruction linear-phase FIR filter banks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Filter bank","Frequency","Design methodology","Lattices","Band pass filters","Design optimization","Constraint optimization","Hardware","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","band-pass filters","circuit optimisation","network synthesis","signal sampling","signal reconstruction","least squares approximations","filtering theory","frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear-phase FIR filter banks","perfect-reconstruction","critically sampled M-channel uniform-band filters","linear-phase analysis filters","linear-phase synthesis filters","impulse responses","optimization program","analysis filter coefficients","least-squares criterion","frequency responses","frequency bands","signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to the design of critically sampled M-channel uniform-band perfect-reconstruction linear-phase FIR filter banks","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944050","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to the design of critically sampled M-channel uniform-band perfect-reconstruction linear-phase FIR filter banks","sourcePdf":"00678467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038719S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","articleId":"678467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":678469,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"lastName":"Xiang-Gen Xia","id":"37274950700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"678469","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Band pass filters","Compaction","Energy resolution","Signal resolution","Design methodology","Fourier transforms","Wavelet transforms","Engineering profession"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","filtering theory","band-pass filters","network synthesis","low-pass filters","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete multiwavelet transforms","prefilter banks design","multiwavelet transforms","orthogonal prefilters","coding","discrete multiwavelet decomposition","nonmaximally decimated prefilters","multiwavelet transform coefficients","redundant prefiltering","energy compaction ratio","Daubechies D/sub 4/ wavelet transform","lowpass property","Geronimo-Hardin-Massopust 2 wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"In conventional wavelet transforms, prefiltering is not necessary due to the lowpass property of a scaling function. This is no longer true for multiwavelet transforms. A few research papers on the design of prefilters have appeared, but the existing prefilters are usually not orthogonal, which often causes problems in coding. Moreover, the condition on the prefilters was imposed based on the first-step discrete multiwavelet decomposition. We propose a new prefilter design that combines the ideas of the conventional wavelet transforms and multiwavelet transforms. The prefilters are orthogonal but nonmaximally decimated. They are derived from a very natural calculation of multiwavelet transform coefficients. In this new prefilter design, multiple step discrete multiwavelet decomposition is taken into account. Our numerical examples (by taking care of the redundant prefiltering) indicate that the energy compaction ratio with the Geronimo-Hardin-Massopust (1994) 2 wavelet transform and our new prefiltering is better than the one with Daubechies D/sub 4/ wavelet transform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new prefilter design for discrete multiwavelet transforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.678469","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14942/00678469.pdf","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.678469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"A new prefilter design for discrete multiwavelet transforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944051","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new prefilter design for discrete multiwavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00678469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052788S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"68","articleId":"678469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678472,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The application of the limit of zero generator spacing, with finite rotor inertia and transmission line impedance per unit length, yields a nonlinear partial differential equation in time and two spatial dimensions for the rotor phase angle. The equation is a nonlinear version of the standard second-order wave equation which exhibits an explicit expression for the finite wave phase velocity. The electromechanical wave propagation characteristics, equilibrium solutions, and linear stability are investigated and some potentially important results are presented. Numerical simulations of the usual discrete generator model, based upon the swing equation, are presented and demonstrate the electromechanical wave propagation as having interesting properties. Numerical solutions of the analogous continuum model are compared to the discrete model and are found to be in excellent agreement. A numerical estimate of the wave phase velocity for the U.S. power grid is consistent with observations of the transient wave phenomena during staged fault events. The continuum model enables an array of alternative analytic and simulation methods to be applied to the study of global power system characteristics, such as stability and transient dynamics.","doi":"10.1109/81.678472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/14947/00678472.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.678472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromechanical wave propagation in large electric power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Electromechanical wave propagation in large electric power systems","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5951243","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromechanical wave propagation in large electric power systems","sourcePdf":"00678472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038853S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"150","articleId":"678472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678475,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This problem is relevant to multiple access communication systems without power control and radar. Assuming that the signal strength is attenuated over distance r as 1/r/m, we show that the interference/clutter could be modeled as a spherically symmetric /spl alpha/-stable noise. A novel approach to stable noise modeling is introduced based on the LePage series representation. This establishes grounds to investigate practical constraints in the system model adopted, such as the finite number of interferers and nonhomogeneous Poisson fields of interferers. In addition, the formulas derived allow us to predict noise statistics in environments with lognormal shadowing and Rayleigh fading. The results obtained are useful for the prediction of noise statistics in a wide range of environments with deterministic and stochastic power propagation laws. Computer simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the /spl alpha/-stable noise model in multiuser communication systems. The analysis presented will be important in the performance evaluation of complex communication systems and in the design of efficient interference suppression techniques.","doi":"10.1109/78.678475","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/14942/00678475.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.678475","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1601","endPage":"1611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic alpha-stable noise modeling in a Poisson field of interferers or scatterers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Analytic alpha-stable noise modeling in a Poisson field of interferers or scatterers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678475/","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic alpha-stable noise modeling in a Poisson field of interferers or scatterers","sourcePdf":"00678475.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053147S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"199","articleId":"678475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":678481,"authors":[{"name":"Wing-Hung Ki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wing-Hung Ki","id":"37269638700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7122"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1268"}],"articleNumber":"678481","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1714},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678481","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Flow graphs","Signal analysis","Pulse width modulation converters","Switches","DC-DC power converters","Switching converters","Character generation","Equations","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal flow graphs","DC-DC power convertors","switched mode power supplies","PWM power convertors","state-space methods","circuit stability","switching networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal flow graph","loop gain analysis","DC-DC PWM CCM switching converters","switch mode power converters","continuous conduction mode","loop gains","single-loop systems","multiloop systems","perturbed state-space averaged equations","characteristic polynomial","error amplifier","voltage-programming converters","trailing-edge modulation","leading-edge modulation","analog injection method","system loop gain","stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/81.678481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/14947/00678481.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.678481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal flow graph in loop gain analysis of DC-DC PWM CCM switching converters","abstract":"A systematic and unified method using the signal flow graph (SFG) technique is presented in analyzing dc-dc pulsewidth modulated (PWM) switch mode power converters (SMPC's) operating in the continuous conduction mode (CCM). Loop gains for single and multiloop systems are reviewed. The SFG of the converter is then generated from the perturbed state-space averaged (SSA) equations, and the characteristic polynomial of the system is computed. By grouping terms associated with the gain of the error amplifier as the numerator, a unique definition of system loop gain is introduced, and locations for breaking the loop are discussed. System loop gains for both voltage- and current-programming converters with either trailing- or leading-edge modulation are derived.

In the lowest doped (5/spl times/10/sup 14/ cm/sup -3/) thick collector the multiplication is determined by the local electric field. As the collector doping increases, the measured multiplication is found to be significantly reduced at low values of multiplication from that predicted by the electric field profile. However, good agreement is always found at high multiplication, close to breakdown. This reduction in multiplication at low electric fields is attributed to the dead space, the minimum distance over which carriers must travel before gaining the ionization threshold energy. A simple correction for the dead space is proposed, allowing the multiplication to be accurately predicted even in heavily doped structures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/14932/00678515.pdf","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.678515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.678515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14932","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avalanche multiplication in GaInP/GaAs single heterojunction bipolar transistors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Space exploration","Electrons","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Density measurement","Gain measurement","Doping profiles","Electric variables measurement","Electric breakdown","Ionization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","gallium arsenide","indium compounds","III-V semiconductors","heterojunction bipolar transistors","avalanche breakdown","impact ionisation","doping profiles","heavily doped semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche multiplication","GaInP/GaAs HBT","single heterojunction bipolar transistors","electron multiplication factors","base-collector bias","GaAs collector doping densities","local electric field","electric field profile","dead space correction","ionization threshold energy","heavily doped structures","GaInP-GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Avalanche multiplication in GaInP/GaAs single heterojunction bipolar transistors","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5929198","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avalanche multiplication in GaInP/GaAs single heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00678515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032234S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","articleId":"678515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":678516,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.T.

The key issue for controlling the retention time distribution has been clarified and its model has been proposed for the first time. Trench capacitor cell with 0.6-/spl mu/m ground rule was evaluated. It was found that the retention time distribution consists of \"tail distribution\" and \"main distribution.\" \"tail distribution,\" by which DRAM refresh characteristics are restricted, depends on the boron concentration of the memory cell region. As boron concentration of the memory cell region increases, \"tail distribution\" is enhanced. This enhancement is due to the increase of the junction leakage current from the storage node. For the purpose of accounting for the nature of \"Tail Distribution,\" the concept of thermionic field emission (TFE) current has been introduced. The high electric field at pn junction of the storage node enhances thermionic field emission from a deep level. The activation energy of the deep level is normally distributed among the memory cells, which leads to the normal distribution of log(retention time). Two methods for reducing \"tail distribution\" are proposed. One is to reduce the electric field of the depletion layer of the storage node. The other is to reduce the concentration of the deep level for TFE current.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","volume":"45","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5929210","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the retention time distribution of dynamic random access memory (DRAM)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the retention time distribution of dynamic random access memory (DRAM)","sourcePdf":"00678551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063373S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"177","articleId":"678551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":678570,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The degradation is a strong function of the amount of injected charge density (Q/sub inj/), oxide thickness, and the direction of stress. Positive charge trapping is usually dominant at low Q/sub inj/ followed by negative charge trapping at high Q/sub inj/, causing a turnaround of gate voltage and threshold voltage. Interface trap generation continues to increase with increasing stress, as evidenced by subthreshold slope and transconductance. Gate injection stress creates more positive charge traps and interface traps than does substrate injection stress. Oxide degradation gets more severe for thicker oxide, due to more oxide charge trapping and interface trap generation by impact ionization. A simple model of oxide degradation and breakdown was established based on the experimental results. It indicates that the damage in the oxide is more serious near the anode interface by impact ionization and oxide breakdown is also closely related to surface roughness at the cathode interface. When all the damage sites in the oxide connect and a conductive path between cathode and anode is formed, oxide breakdown occurs. The damage is more serious for thicker oxide because a thicker oxide is more susceptible to impact ionization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678579/","volume":"45","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5929219","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of thin tunnel gate oxide under constant Fowler-Nordheim current stress for a flash EEPROM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of thin tunnel gate oxide under constant Fowler-Nordheim current stress for a flash EEPROM","sourcePdf":"00678579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051758S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"96","articleId":"678579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":678601,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, their clinical manifestation is often subtle, which tends to hinder their diagnosis at the earliest possible time. This represents an undesirable situation since the failure to quickly and accurately diagnose seizure can lead to longer-term brain injury or even death. Here, the authors consider the problem of automatic seizure detection in the neonate based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data. They propose a new approach based on a model for the generation of the EEG, which is derived from the histology and biophysics of a localized portion of the brain. They show that by using this approach, good detection performance of electrographic seizure is possible. The model for seizure is first presented along with an estimator for the model parameters. Then the authors present a seizure-detection scheme based on the model parameter estimates. This scheme is compared with the quadratic detection filter (QDF), and is shown to give superior performance over the latter. This is due to the ability of the model-based detector to account for the variability (nonstationarity) of the EEG by adjusting its parameters appropriately.","doi":"10.1109/10.678601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14927/00678601.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.678601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"673","endPage":"685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seizure detection of newborn EEG using a model-based approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Seizure detection of newborn EEG using a model-based approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678601/","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5935193","pubMedId":"9609933","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seizure detection of newborn EEG using a model-based approach","sourcePdf":"00678601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039204S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"65","articleId":"678601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":678605,"authors":[{"name":"P.

When the uneven sampling can be modeled as uniform sampling plus a stationary random deviation, this spectrum results in a periodic repetition of the original continuous time spectrum at the mean Nyquist frequency, with a low-pass effect affecting upper frequency bands that depends on the sampling dispersion. If the dispersion is small compared with the mean sampling period, the estimation at the base band is unbiased with practically no dispersion. When uneven sampling is modeled by a deterministic sinusoidal variation respect to the uniform sampling the obtained results are in agreement with those obtained for small random deviation. This approximation is usually well satisfied in signals like heart rate (HR) series. The theoretically predicted performance has been tested and corroborated with simulated and real HR signals. The Lomb method has been compared with the classical power spectral density (PSD) estimators that include resampling to get uniform sampling. The authors have found that the Lomb method avoids the major problem of classical methods: the low-pass effect of the resampling. Also only frequencies up to the mean Nyquist frequency should be considered (lower than 0.5 Hz if the HR is lower than 60 bpm). It is concluded that for PSD estimation of unevenly sampled signals the Lomb method is more suitable than fast Fourier transform or autoregressive estimate with linear or cubic interpolation. In extreme situations (low-HR or high-frequency components) the Lomb estimate still introduces high-frequency contamination that suggest further studies of superior performance interpolators. In the case of HR signals the authors have also marked the convenience of selecting a stationary heart rate period to carry out a heart rate variability analysis.","doi":"10.1109/10.678605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14927/00678605.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.678605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power spectral density of unevenly sampled data by least-square analysis: performance and application to heart rate signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Power spectral density of unevenly sampled data by least-square analysis: performance and application to heart rate signals","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5942188","pubMedId":"9609935","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power spectral density of unevenly sampled data by least-square analysis: performance and application to heart rate signals","sourcePdf":"00678605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052855S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"180","articleId":"678605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678613,"authors":[{"name":"E-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"E-Liang Chen","id":"37365631500"},{"name":"Pau-Choo Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pau-Choo Chung","id":"37287692900"},{"name":"Ching-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Liang Chen","id":"37616351500"},{"name":"Hong-Ming Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Medical College and Hospital, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Ming Tsai","id":"38042426700"},{"name":"Chein-I Chang","lastName":"Chein-I Chang","id":"38559764500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"678613","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":186,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":1441},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Image classification","Image segmentation","Liver neoplasms","Neural networks","Biomedical imaging","Liver diseases","Cancer","Needles","Biopsy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["liver","image classification","medical image processing","computerised tomography","edge detection","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic diagnostic system","CT liver image classification","CT liver boundary","liver diseases","medical diagnostic imaging","detect-before-extract system","neural network liver classifier","feature descriptors","liver tumors","hepatoma","hemageoma","normalized fractional Brownian motion model","initial liver boundary","deformable contour model","gray-level co-occurrence matrix","fractal feature information"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","Fractals","Hemangioma","Hemangioma","Humans","Liver","Liver Neoplasms","Liver Neoplasms","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Radiographic Image Enhancement","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"abstract":"Computed tomography (CT) images have been widely used for liver disease diagnosis.

In this paper, a CT liver image diagnostic classification system is presented which will automatically find, extract the CT liver boundary and further classify liver diseases. The system comprises a detect-before-extract (DBE) system which automatically finds the liver boundary and a neural network liver classifier which uses specially designed feature descriptors to distinguish normal liver, two types of liver tumors, hepatoma and hemageoma. The DBE system applies the concept of the normalized fractional Brownian motion model to find an initial liver boundary and then uses a deformable contour model to precisely delineate the liver boundary. The neural network is included to classify liver tumors into hepatoma and hemageoma. It is implemented by a modified probabilistic neural network (PNN) [MPNN] in conjunction with feature descriptors which are generated by fractal feature information and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. The proposed system was evaluated by 30 liver cases and shown to be efficient and very effective.","doi":"10.1109/10.678613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14927/00678613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.678613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14927","startPage":"783","endPage":"794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automatic diagnostic system for CT liver image classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An automatic diagnostic system for CT liver image classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5942196","pubMedId":"9609943","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automatic diagnostic system for CT liver image classification","sourcePdf":"00678613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080945S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"186","articleId":"678613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":678614,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Surface EMG waveforms were sampled during nonfatiguing, constant-force, constant-angle contractions of the biceps or triceps muscles, over the range of 10%-75% maximum voluntary contraction. EMG amplitude estimates were computed with eight different EMG processor schemes using smoothing length durations spanning 2.45-500 ms. An SNR was computed from each amplitude estimate (deviations about the mean value of the estimate were considered as noise). Over these window lengths, average /spl plusmn/ standard deviation SNR's ranged from 1.4/spl plusmn/0.28 to 16.2/spl plusmn/5.4 for unwhitened single-channel EMG processing and from 3.2/spl plusmn/0.7 to 37.3/spl plusmn/14.2 for whitened, multiple-channel EMG processing (results pooled across contraction level). It was found that SNR increased with window length in a square root fashion. The shape of this relationship was consistent with classic theoretical predictions, however none of the processors achieved the absolute performance level predicted by the theory. These results are useful in selecting the length of the smoothing window in traditional surface EMG studies. In addition, this study should contribute to the development of EMG processors which dynamically tune the smoothing window length when the EMG amplitude is time varying.","doi":"10.1109/10.678614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.678614","startPage":"795","endPage":"799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14927/00678614.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of smoothing window length on electromyogram amplitude estimates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Influence of smoothing window length on electromyogram amplitude estimates","publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5942197","pubMedId":"9609944","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678614/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of smoothing window length on electromyogram amplitude estimates","sourcePdf":"00678614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032166S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"39","articleId":"678614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":678616,"authors":[{"name":"P.

An image is considered as a set of one-dimensional signals, and so all processing including the wavelet transform are one-dimensionally executed. The artifact reduction operation is applied to only the neighborhood of each block boundary in the wavelet transform at the first and second scales. The key idea behind the method is to remove the blocking component which reveals stepwise discontinuities at block boundaries. Each block boundary is classified into one of shade region, smooth edge region, and step edge region. Threshold values for the classification are selected adaptively according to each coded image. The performance is evaluated for 512/spl times/512 images JPEG coded with 30:1 and 40:1 compression ratios. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields not only a PSNR improvement of about 0.69-1.06 dB, but also a subjective quality nearly free of the blocking artifact and edge blur.","doi":"10.1109/76.678618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/14948/00678618.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.678618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of blocking artifact in block-coded images using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678618/","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of blocking artifact in block-coded images using wavelet transform","volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944034","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of blocking artifact in block-coded images using wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00678618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040971S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"42","articleId":"678618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678620,"authors":[{"name":"I-Ming Pao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"I-Ming Pao","id":"37369782600"},{"name":"Ming-Ting Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Ting Sun","id":"37278328800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"678620","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":150},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Quantization","PSNR","Software quality","Video codecs","Degradation","DVD","Satellite broadcasting","Bit rate","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","transform coding","code standards","telecommunication standards","discrete cosine transforms","quantisation (signal)","approximation theory","video codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward discrete cosine transform","DCT","peak-signal-to-noise ratio","PSNR","software implementation","video standard encoders","H.26x","MPEG","quantization parameters","nonzero DCT coefficient position","approximate DCT coefficients","computation savings","statistical characteristics","video codecs"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents new schemes to reduce the computation of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) with negligible peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) degradation.

We investigated the relationship between the quantization parameters and the position of the last nonzero DCT coefficient after quantization. That information is used to adaptively make the decision of calculating all 8/spl times/8 DCT coefficients or only part of the coefficients. To further reduce the computation, instead of using the exact DCT coefficients, we propose a method to approximate the DCT coefficients which leads to significant computation savings. The results show that for practical situations, significant computation reductions can be achieved while causing negligible PSNR degradation. The proposed method also results in computation savings in the quantization calculations.","doi":"10.1109/76.678620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/14948/00678620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.678620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14948","startPage":"264","endPage":"268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation of calculations for forward discrete cosine transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximation of calculations for forward discrete cosine transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678620/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation of calculations for forward discrete cosine transform","sourcePdf":"00678620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052752S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"24","articleId":"678620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":678622,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The system employed an enhanced H.263-compatible video codec. Since most existing wireless systems exhibit a constant bit-rate, the video codec's bit-rate fluctuation was smoothed by a novel adaptive packetization algorithm, which is capable of supporting automatic repeat request (ARQ)-assisted operation in wireless distributive video transmissions, although in the proposed low-latency interactive videophone transceiver, we refrained from using ARQ. Instead, corrupted packets are dropped by both the local and remote decoders in order to prevent error propagation. The minimum required channel signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) was in the range of 8-28 dB for the various transmission scenarios, while the corresponding video peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) was in the range of 32-39 dB.

Experimental results also suggest that intercluster separation plays a more important role in cluster validation than cluster diameter.

Our approach is based on the alternate execution of two fundamental processes: map building and navigation. In the former, range measures are collected through the robot exteroceptive sensors and processed in order to build a local representation of the surrounding area. This representation is then integrated in the global map so far reconstructed by filtering out insufficient or conflicting information. In the navigation phase, an A*-based planner generates a local path from the current robot position to the goal. Such a path is safe inside the explored area and provides a direction for further exploration. The robot follows the path up to the boundary of the explored area, terminating its motion if unexpected obstacles are encountered. The most peculiar aspects of our method are the use of fuzzy logic for the efficient building and modification of the environment map, and the iterative application of A*, a complete planning algorithm which takes full advantage of local information. Experimental results for a NOMAD 200 mobile robot show the real-time performance of the proposed method, both in static and moderately dynamic environments.","doi":"10.1109/3477.678626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.678626","endPage":"333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/14930/00678626.pdf","startPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time map building and navigation for autonomous robots in unknown environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678626/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time map building and navigation for autonomous robots in unknown environments","volume":"28","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5928408","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18255950","publicationDate":"June 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time map building and navigation for autonomous robots in unknown environments","sourcePdf":"00678626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052082S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"133","articleId":"678626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678627,"authors":[{"name":"Lynn Yaling Cai","affiliation":["Ginston Research Center, Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lynn Yaling Cai","id":"37087913453"},{"name":"Hon Keung Kwan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Hon Keung Kwan","id":"37087150031"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"678627","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":308},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678627","abstract":"In this paper, fuzzy inference models for pattern classifications have been developed and fuzzy inference networks based on these models are proposed. Most of the existing fuzzy rule-based systems have difficulties in deriving inference rules and membership functions directly from training data. Rules and membership functions are obtained from experts. Some approaches use backpropagation (BP) type learning algorithms to learn the parameters of membership functions from training data. However, BP algorithms take a long time to converge and they require an advanced setting of the number of inference rules. The work to determine the number of inference rules demands lots of experiences from the designer. In this paper, self-organizing learning algorithms are proposed for the fuzzy inference networks. In the proposed learning algorithms, the number of inference rules and the membership functions in the inference rules will be automatically determined during the training procedure. The learning speed is fast. The proposed fuzzy inference network (FIN) classifiers possess both the structure and the learning ability of neural networks, and the fuzzy classification ability of fuzzy algorithms. Simulation results on fuzzy classification of two-dimensional data are presented and compared with those of the fuzzy ARTMAP. The proposed fuzzy inference networks perform better than the fuzzy ARTMAP and need less training samples.","doi":"10.1109/3477.678627","startPage":"334","endPage":"347","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/14930/00678627.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.678627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy classifications using fuzzy inference networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Partitioning algorithms","Inference algorithms","Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Classification algorithms","Training data","Pattern classification","Fuzzy systems","Backpropagation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","inference mechanisms","pattern recognition","fuzzy neural nets","backpropagation","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy classifications","fuzzy inference networks","pattern classifications","fuzzy rule-based systems","membership functions","training data","backpropagation type learning algorithms","self-organizing learning algorithms","simulation results","fuzzy ARTMAP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy classifications using fuzzy inference networks","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5928409","pubMedId":"18255951","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy classifications using fuzzy inference networks","sourcePdf":"00678627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043801S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"30","articleId":"678627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":678629,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The system presented here is based on a neural network used to detect incipient slippage and on a skin-like sensor sensible to normal and shear stresses. Normal and shear stresses components inside the sensor are the input data of the neural net. An important feature of the system is that the a priori knowledge of the friction coefficient between the sensor and the object being manipulated is not needed. To validate the method we worked on both simulated and experimental data. In the first case, the finite element method is used to solve the direct problem of elastic contact in its full nonlinearity by resorting to the lowest number of approximations regarding the real problem. Simulation has shown that the network learns and is robust to noise. Then an experimental test was carried out. Experimental results show that, in a simple case, the method is able to detect the insipiency of slippage between an object and the sensor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5928410","pubMedId":"18255952","volume":"28","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection of incipient object slippage by skin-like sensing and neural network processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of incipient object slippage by skin-like sensing and neural network processing","sourcePdf":"00678629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039328S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"51","articleId":"678629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":678630,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A dynamic programming algorithm, using a multiview matching cost as well as pure geometrical constraints, is used to estimate disparity and to identify the occluded areas in the extreme left and right views. A significant advantage of the proposed approach is that the exact number of views in which each point appears (is not occluded) can be determined. The disparity and occlusion information obtained may then be used to create virtual images from intermediate viewpoints. Furthermore, techniques are developed for the coding of occlusion and disparity information, which is needed at the receiver for the reproduction of a multiview sequence using the two encoded extreme views.

By using a measure of similarity, a rule base simplification method is proposed that reduces the number of fuzzy sets in the model. Similar fuzzy sets are merged to create a common fuzzy set to replace them in the rule base. If the redundancy in the model is high, merging similar fuzzy sets might result in equal rules that also can be merged, thereby reducing the number of rules as well. The simplified rule base is computationally more efficient and linguistically more tractable.

It is assumed, in our approach, that the original image is highly correlated. Thus, the global frequency characteristics in two adjacent blocks are similar to the local ones in each block. We consider the high-frequency components in the global characteristics of a decoded image, which are not found in the local ones, as the results from the blocking artifact. We employ an N-point discrete cosine transform (DCT) to obtain the local characteristics, and a 2N-point DCT to obtain the global ones, and then derive the relation between the N-point and 2N-point DCT coefficients. A careful comparison of the N-point with the 2N-point DCT coefficients makes it possible to detect the undesired high-frequency components, mainly caused by the blocking artifact. Then, we propose novel convex sets and their projection operators in the DCT domain. The performance of the proposed and conventional techniques are compared on the still images, decoded by JPEG. The results show that, regardless of the content of the input images, the proposed technique yields significantly better performance than the conventional techniques in terms of objective quality, subjective quality, and convergence behavior.","doi":"10.1109/76.678636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/14948/00678636.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.678636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the POCS-based postprocessing technique to reduce the blocking artifacts in transform coded images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678636/","displayDocTitle":"On the POCS-based postprocessing technique to reduce the blocking artifacts in transform coded images","volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944044","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the POCS-based postprocessing technique to reduce the blocking artifacts in transform coded images","sourcePdf":"00678636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047097S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"110","articleId":"678636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":678637,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Yao","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Group School of Computer Science, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"lastName":"Xin Yao","id":"37087181950"},{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Group School of Computer Science, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"lastName":"Yong Liu","id":"37087154766"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"678637","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":181,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":392},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678637","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the simultaneous evolution of artificial neural network (ANN) architectures and weights. The current practice in evolving ANN's is to choose the best ANN in the last generation as the final result. This paper proposes a different approach to form the final result by combining all the individuals in the last generation in order to make best use of all the information contained in the whole population. This approach regards a population of ANN's as an ensemble and uses a combination method to integrate them. Although there has been some work on integrating ANN modules, little has been done in evolutionary learning to make best use of its population information. Four linear combination methods have been investigated in this paper to illustrate our ideas. Three real-world data sets have been used in our experimental studies, which show that the recursive least-square (RLS) algorithm always produces an integrated system that outperforms the best individual. The results confirm that a population contains more information than a single individual. Evolutionary learning should exploit such information to improve generalization of learned systems.","doi":"10.1109/3477.678637","startPage":"417","endPage":"425","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/14930/00678637.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.678637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Making use of population information in evolutionary artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Artificial neural networks","Resonance light scattering","Genetic programming","Evolutionary computation","Design methodology","Australia Council","Computational intelligence","Computer science","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural net architecture","optimisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","software prototyping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population information","evolutionary artificial neural networks","artificial neural network architectures","evolutionary learning","recursive least-square algorithm","integrated system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Making use of population information in evolutionary artificial neural networks","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5928415","pubMedId":"18255957","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making use of population information in evolutionary artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00678637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093377S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"181","articleId":"678637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":678641,"authors":[{"name":"Chu Kwong Chak","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Control, School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Chu Kwong Chak","id":"37087152665"},{"name":"Gang Feng","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Control, School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Gang Feng","id":"37087152770"},{"name":"Jian Ma","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jian Ma","id":"37087152597"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"678641","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"abstract":"An adaptive fuzzy system implemented within the framework of neural network is proposed.

The result of this work is an image sensor, with log-polar structure, suitable for image processing since the log-polar mapping has interesting mathematical and image data reduction properties.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-variant nonorthogonal structure CMOS image sensor design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.678644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/14931/00678644.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.678644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Space-variant nonorthogonal structure CMOS image sensor design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5935159","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-variant nonorthogonal structure CMOS image sensor design","sourcePdf":"00678644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042495S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"28","articleId":"678644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678647,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo-Yuan Hsiao","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits and Systems Lab, Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shuo-Yuan Hsiao","id":"37346409300"},{"name":"Chung-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits and Systems Lab, Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Yu Wu","id":"37276423000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"678647","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":825},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Bandwidth","Voltage","Circuits","Linearity","Total harmonic distortion","Joining processes","Radio frequency","Mixers","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","analogue multipliers","UHF mixers","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel structure","CMOS four-quadrant analog multipliers","RF downconversion mixer","differential input signals","combiners","N-well CMOS technology","double-poly-double-metal CMOS","mixer-core","output buffer","2 GHz","1.9 GHz","0.5 micron","0.8 micron","1.2 V","3 V","2.2 MHz","2.3 mA","-1 dB","2.2 GHz","180 MHz","22 dB","21 mA"]}],"abstract":"A parallel structure for a CMOS four-quadrant analog multiplier is proposed and analyzed.

The HBT of the cascode is used to construct a VCO by presenting the base with an HEMT tunable active inductor. The VCO can be tuned from 28.5 to 29.3 GHz while providing /spl ap/0 dBm of output power. Operated as an upconverter, the MMIC achieves 6-9 dB conversion loss over a 31-39 GHz output frequency band. Using these active approaches, both VCO and mixer functions were integrated into a compact 1.44/spl times/0.76 mm/sup 2/ chip area.

PRSA inherits the global convergence property from simulated annealing and the parallelism property from genetic algorithms. PRSA was implemented on a monoprocessor system as well as on a transputer. The algorithm, its parallel implementation, and its application to an NP-hard problem, namely standard cell placement in very large scale integration (VLSI) chip design, are described. PRSA was run for a large range of test cases. Since its performance depends on many parameters, the effects of parameter variations are studied in detail. Some important parameters are migration of individuals to other transputer nodes and selection strategies for constructing new populations. In comparison with simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, PRSA was found to produce better solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving optimization problems by parallel recombinative simulated annealing on a parallel computer-an application to standard cell placement in VLSI design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/3477.678649","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/14930/00678649.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.678649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Solving optimization problems by parallel recombinative simulated annealing on a parallel computer-an application to standard cell placement in VLSI design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5928420","pubMedId":"18255962","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving optimization problems by parallel recombinative simulated annealing on a parallel computer-an application to standard cell placement in VLSI design","sourcePdf":"00678649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036431S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"18","articleId":"678649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678656,"authors":[{"name":"E.B.

The closed-loop system is shown to be stable; moreover, the state vector of the controlled system converges to a ball centered at the origin and having a radius that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the high gain K and the number of neural network regressor terms. No growth conditions on the nonlinearities of the system are imposed with the exception that such nonlinearities are sufficiently smooth. Finally, we mention that neither the system dynamics or the CLF of the system need to be known in order to apply the proposed methodology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/14930/00678656.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/3477.678656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.678656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal stabilization using control Lyapunov functions, adaptive derivative feedback, and neural network approximators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neurofeedback","Control systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Lyapunov method","Nonlinear control systems","Robust control","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","stability","neural nets","Lyapunov methods","closed loop systems","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["universal stabilization","control Lyapunov functions","adaptive derivative feedback","neural network approximators","unknown nonlinear dynamical systems","adaptive feedback law","linear-in-the-weights neural networks","time-derivative","Lyapunov function","closed-loop system","state vector","system dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Universal stabilization using control Lyapunov functions, adaptive derivative feedback, and neural network approximators","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5928423","pubMedId":"18255965","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal stabilization using control Lyapunov functions, adaptive derivative feedback, and neural network approximators","sourcePdf":"00678656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051415S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"24","articleId":"678656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":678658,"authors":[{"name":"De-Shuang Huang","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of System Engineering, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"De-Shuang Huang","id":"37087142703"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"678658","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678658","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Neurons","Sufficient conditions","Cost function","Systems engineering and theory","Least squares approximation","Resonance light scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local minima-free condition","feedforward neural networks","outer-supervised learning","batch-style learning","embedded subspace method","hidden neurons","global minima","range space","error surface"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3477.678658","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/14930/00678658.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","startPage":"477","endPage":"480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.678658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The local minima-free condition of feedforward neural networks for outer-supervised learning","abstract":"In this paper, the local minima-free conditions of the outer-supervised feedforward neural networks (FNN) based on batch-style learning are studied by means of the embedded subspace method.

Inherent to electronic packages are the presence of geometric and material discontinuities. The regions where adhesive bond lines intersect with convective heat loss surfaces are the most critical locations for failure initiation due to heat flux singularities and extreme thermo-mechanical stresses. Thus, accurate calculation of the flux field, as well as the temperature field, is essential in transient thermomechanical stress analysis. Although the finite element method (FEM) is highly efficient and commonly used, its application with conventional elements suffers from poor accuracy in the prediction of the flux field in these regions. The accuracy of the results from the boundary element method (BEM) formulation, which requires computationally intensive time-integration schemes, is much higher than that of the FEM. However, in this study, a novel boundary element-finite element coupling algorithm is developed to investigate transient thermal response of electronic packages consisting of dissimilar materials. The new algorithm combines the advantages of both methods while not requiring any iterations along the interfaces between BEM and FEM domains.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient heat conduction analysis of electronic packages by coupled boundary and finite element methods","publicationTitle":"1998 Proceedings. 48th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (Cat.

However, until recently, designers of integrated circuit and package did not give much consideration to electromagnetic radiated emission and interference in their designs. Decoupling capacitors have been mostly used to reduce the power/ground bounce of high-speed digital system and boards. However, there has not been a systematic study to understand the effects of on-chip and off-chip decoupling capacitors on the electromagnetic radiated emission. In this paper, we report the simulation and the measurement results regarding the radiated emission due to the power/ground bounce. And we discuss the effects of the on-chip and off-chip decoupling capacitors to the power/ground bounce and the electromagnetic radiated emission. This circuit is simulated using HSPICE. Test ICs and printed circuit boards were designed and fabricated. Using a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell, the radiated electric field of the device under test (DUT) is measured. Combined placement of the on-chip and off-chip decoupling capacitor achieves more than 10 dB suppression of the radiated emission on the whole spectrum region. The design rule of the optimum placement of the decoupling capacitor was obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1998.678758","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 Proceedings. 48th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (Cat.

With improvements in sensors and computing capability, the trend is to put more and more control on board the vehicle. All robotic vehicles must turn intent into action. This is the function of the on-board controller, which translates higher-level vehicle commands into vehicle motion or activation of the vehicle's equipment. As research into and use of robotic vehicles increases, so does the need for the efficient development and application of controller technology. Toward that end, RedZone Robotics has developed a prototype distributed control system.

Recently, most of the effort in optical amplifier switch modules has been focused on monolithic switches in which the entire device is fabricated on an InP substrate together with the semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). In this paper, we investigate the use of SOAs with passive polymer waveguides to make hybrid switches of varying sizes. The optical amplifiers serve a dual purpose. The SOAs are used in order to gate the signal and amplify the signal in order to offset the losses associated with the passive waveguide elements as well as the losses from component misalignments in the switch module. Our analysis finds the largest switch module size that can be made with the architecture used. We also calculate the maximum number of switch modules which can be cascaded in order to retain a bit error rate (BER) under 10/sup -9/.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.1998.678834","publicationTitle":"1998 Proceedings. 48th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (Cat.

The conventional technique for improving system reliability is through component replication, which usually comes at significant cost: increased design time, testing, power consumption, volume, and weight. We have developed a new fault-tolerance approach that capitalizes on the unique reconfiguration capabilities of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's). The physical design is partitioned into a set of tiles. In response to a component failure, a functionally equivalent tile that does not rely on the faulty component replaces the affected tile. Unlike application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and microprocessor design methods, which result in fixed structures, this technique allows a single physical component to provide redundant backup for several types of components. Experimental results conducted on a subset of the MCNC benchmarks demonstrate a high level of reliability with low timing and hardware overhead.","doi":"10.1109/92.678870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/14940/00678870.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.678870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low overhead fault-tolerant FPGA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678870/","displayDocTitle":"Low overhead fault-tolerant FPGA systems","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5944447","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low overhead fault-tolerant FPGA systems","sourcePdf":"00678870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049096S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"110","articleId":"678870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678873,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

In this paper, we develop a novel formulation of both routing and routability estimation that relies on a rendering of the routing constraints as a single large Boolean equation. Any satisfying assignment to this equation specifies a complete detailed routing. By representing the equation as a binary decision diagram (BDD), we represent all possible routes for all nets simultaneously. Routability estimation is transformed to Boolean satisfiability, which is trivial for BDD's. We use the technique in the context of a perfect routability estimator for a global router.

Experimental results indicate that complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's) can perform useful computation at 250 MHz. The notion of an \"event horizon\" for FPGA's leads to clear design constraints for high-speed application developers, and can be applied to a variety of real-time signal processing algorithms. Recent estimates indicate that higher performance FPGA's available early in 1998 can attain speeds of over 300 MHz using 20% fewer logic elements than current designs. The results of this design work provide important clues on how to improve FPGA architectures for signal processing at hundreds of MHz. Direct routing channels between logic elements can significantly increase performance. Routing architectures with four-way symmetry allow for rotations and reflections of subcircuits needed for optimal packing density. Experimental results indicate that clock buffering often limits the top speed of the FPGA. Wave pipelining of the clock distribution network may improve FPGA performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal processing at 250 MHz using high-performance FPGA's","doi":"10.1109/92.678878","startPage":"238","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.678878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/14940/00678878.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Signal processing at 250 MHz using high-performance FPGA's","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944450","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal processing at 250 MHz using high-performance FPGA's","sourcePdf":"00678878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029426S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"24","articleId":"678878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":678880,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The benefits of gate-level specialization and reconfigurability can be extended by reconfiguring circuit resources at run-time. This technique, termed run-time reconfiguration (RTR), allows the exploitation of dynamic conditions or temporal locality within application-specific problems. For several applications, this technique has been shown to reduce the hardware resources required for computation. The use of this technique on conventional FPGA's, however, requires additional time for circuit reconfiguration. A functional density metric is introduced that balances the advantages of RTR against its associated reconfiguration costs. This metric is used to justify run-time reconfiguration against other more conventional approaches. Several run-time reconfigured applications are presented and analyzed using this approach.","doi":"10.1109/92.678880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/14940/00678880.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.678880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving functional density using run-time circuit reconfiguration [FPGAs]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678880/","displayDocTitle":"Improving functional density using run-time circuit reconfiguration [FPGAs]","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5944451","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving functional density using run-time circuit reconfiguration [FPGAs]","sourcePdf":"00678880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045729S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"50","articleId":"678880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":678883,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Due to the synergistic effect of all neurons for ordering, the SOM-WSI is expected to reach the desired global-ordering state even in the presence of defective neurons. This fault tolerant capability, however, has not yet been studied. In this paper, we propose a fundamental SOM-WSI structure and its defect model. From the defect model, we derive a critical-stuck-output and show that if the defective neuron's stuck-output is larger than the critical-stuck-output, the defective SOM can eventually organize itself completely tolerating defects. In an ordinary digital design of a neuron, the critical-stuck-output is proved to be small. Therefore, we can expect high-fault tolerance in the SOM-WSI. Experiments are carried out by injecting defective neurons in a neurocomputer currently used as a prototype of the SOM-WSI. The experimental result agrees well with the proposed theory. In addition, we derive an equation to estimate the degree of fault-tolerance in the SOM hardware by expanding the critical-stuck-output calculation. The derived equation can be used to determine the fundamental design parameters in the SOM-WSI as well as other neurocomputer designs.","doi":"10.1109/92.678883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14940","startPage":"257","endPage":"265","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/14940/00678883.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.678883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant self-organizing map implemented by wafer-scale integration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Wafer scale integration","Neurons","Hardware","Pattern classification","Iterative algorithms","Robots","Equations","Image processing","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","self-organising feature maps","wafer-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant self-organizing map","wafer-scale integration","pattern classification","image-processing","robotics","synergistic effect","SOM-WSI","global-ordering state","defective neurons","critical-stuck-output","fundamental design parameters","neurocomputer design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant self-organizing map implemented by wafer-scale integration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5944452","publicationDate":"June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant self-organizing map implemented by wafer-scale integration","sourcePdf":"00678883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080497S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","articleId":"678883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678887,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This permits detection of all single faults (either stuck-at or functional) and some multiple faults using repeated FPGA reprogramming.

For real size applications, due to hardware limitations, it is impossible to have a one-on-one mapping between the CNN hardware cells and all the pixels in the image involved. This paper presents a practical solution by processing the input image, block by block, with the number of pixels in a block being the same as the number of CNN cells in the array. Furthermore, unlike other implementations in which the output is observed at the hard-limiting block, the very large scale integrated (VLSI) architecture hereby described monitors the outputs from the state node. While previous implementations are mostly suitable for black and white applications because of the thresholded outputs, our approach is especially suitable for applications in color (gray) image processing due to the analog nature of the state node. Experimental complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chip results in good agreement with theoretical results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5944459","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time multiplexed color image processing based on a CNN with cell-state outputs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time multiplexed color image processing based on a CNN with cell-state outputs","sourcePdf":"00678895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061052S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","articleId":"678895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":678903,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A nanoscale deformation field of the outmost solder ball was obtained by using the proposed phase shifting technique associated with the corresponding image processing software. In addition, a nonlinear finite element technique, in which the viscoelastic material properties of underfill and the viscoplastic material properties of solder balls were considered was also adapted to simulate the global displacement field - the whole cross-section of the flip-chip package and the local displacement field - the whole cross-section of one solder ball in the flip-chip package. By comparing the predicted deformation values of the flip-chip package obtained from the finite element analysis with the test data obtained from the laser moire interferometry technique, good agreement is obtained. In particular, the nanoscale displacement contours of the solder ball both in x and y directions obtained from the phase shifting technique show much more similar distribution patterns compared with those modeled by the finite element method.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 Proceedings. 48th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (Cat.

The approach was bench marked against published works and found to corroborate remarkbly well despite its simplicity.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.1998.678922","publicationTitle":"1998 Proceedings. 48th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (Cat.

In that way the synapses can be built from very few transistors and the cell layout can be made small.

It is shown that the resulting induction motor efficiency is reasonably close to optimal and that the approach is insensitive to variations in rotor resistance. Although the torque response is not as fast as in field-oriented (FO) control strategies, the response is reasonably fast. In fact, if the mechanical time constant is large relative to the rotor time constant, which is frequently the case, the sacrifice in dynamic performance is insignificant relative to FO strategies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5936433","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A maximum torque per ampere control strategy for induction motor drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum torque per ampere control strategy for induction motor drives","sourcePdf":"00678980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03655S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"108","articleId":"678980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":678993,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

For managing the power, a pattern of daily operation considering the load characteristic of the homeowner, the generation characteristic of the PV power, and the power-leveling demand of the electric utility is prescribed. The system looks up the pattern to select the operation mode, so that powers from the PV array, the batteries and the utility are utilized in a cost-effective manner. As for the control of the system, a novel control technique for the maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) of the PV array is proposed, in which the state-averaged model of the DC-DC power converter, including the dynamic model of the PV array, is derived. Accordingly, a high-performance discrete MPPT controller that tracks the maximum power point with zero-slope regulation and current-mode control is presented. With proposed arrangements on the control of the BESS and the current-to-power scaling factor setting, the DC-DC power converter is capable of combining with the BESS for performing the functions of power conditioning and active power filtering. An experimental 600 W system is implemented, and some simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/41/14939/00678996.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.678996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.678996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=678996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residential photovoltaic energy storage system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Energy storage","DC-DC power converters","Batteries","Control system synthesis","Power system modeling","Control systems","Energy management","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic power systems","solar cell arrays","DC-DC power convertors","battery storage plants","secondary cells","load (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residential photovoltaic energy storage system","DC-DC power converter","battery energy storage system","daily operation pattern","load characteristic","generation characteristic","power-leveling demand","electric utility","maximum power-point tracking","PV array","state-averaged model","dynamic model","zero-slope regulation","current-mode control","power conditioning","active power filtering","600 W"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/678996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Residential photovoltaic energy storage system","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5933762","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residential photovoltaic energy storage system","sourcePdf":"00678996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036681S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"288","articleId":"678996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":678999,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The methodology is based on transforming the closed-loop regulator into an open-loop configuration. The steady-state solution is solved by two iteration loops. The first loop is to find the steady-state state variables when the power converter is at a fixed duty cycle. The circuit waveforms are obtained by a stepwise time-domain simulation method, which is based on using stepwise quadratic formulation of the circuit state variables with progressive analysis of the switches' states. The second iteration loop is to determine the steady-state duty cycle of the PWM modulator output, using an explicit \"fictitious\" ramp offset value as the error index. This two-loop iteration approach lessens the occurrence of the nonconvergence problem that is sometimes found in the single-loop iteration method. Furthermore, the advantages of this method include the following: (1) substantial improvement in speeding up the convergence to steady-state solution; (2) simplicity in requiring simple algebraic manipulations; (3) generality in determining valid topology without prior knowledge of the regulator operation; and (4) directness in determining the switching instants. Several examples illustrating the computational efficiency and the accuracy are presented and are verified with the available literature.","doi":"10.1109/41.679000","pdfPath":"/iel4/41/14939/00679000.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.679000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-state analysis of PWM DC/DC switching regulators using iterative cycle time-domain simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Steady-state analysis of PWM DC/DC switching regulators using iterative cycle time-domain simulation","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5933766","publicationDate":"June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-state analysis of PWM DC/DC switching regulators using iterative cycle time-domain simulation","sourcePdf":"00679000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032455S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"32","articleId":"679000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":679001,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The purpose of this paper is to improve the controller robustness by applying the neural network (NN) technique to compensate for the uncertainties in the robot model. NN control techniques are applied to two impedance control methods: torque-based and position-based impedance control, which are distinguished by the way of the impedance functions being implemented. A novel error signal is proposed for the NN training. In addition, a trajectory modification algorithm is developed to determine the reference trajectory when the environment stiffness is unknown. The robustness analysis of this algorithm to force sensor noise and inaccurate environment position measurement is also presented. The performances of the two NN impedance control schemes are compared by computer simulations. Simulation results based on a three-degrees-of-freedom robot show that highly robust position/force tracking can be achieved in the presence of large uncertainties and force sensor noise.","doi":"10.1109/41.679003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.679003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/41/14939/00679003.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network impedance force control of robot manipulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Neural network impedance force control of robot manipulator","volume":"45","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5933769","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network impedance force control of robot manipulator","sourcePdf":"00679003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028826S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"116","articleId":"679003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":679006,"authors":[{"name":"Kit-Sang Tang","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Kit-Sang Tang","id":"37347942100"},{"name":"Kim-Fung Man","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Kim-Fung Man","id":"37301477500"},{"name":"Sam Kwong","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Sam Kwong","id":"37266290800"},{"name":"Zhi-Feng Liu","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zhi-Feng Liu","id":"37437168700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"679006","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":684},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and optimization of IIR filter structure using hierarchical genetic algorithms","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/41/14939/00679006.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.679006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14939","doi":"10.1109/41.679006","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","IIR filters","Genetic algorithms","Band pass filters","Digital filters","Chebyshev approximation","Filtering","Nonhomogeneous media","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IIR filters","digital filters","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IIR filter structure","hierarchical genetic algorithms","digital filter design","hierarchical multilayer gene structure","chromosome formulation","system structure","parametric variables","optimization","performance requirements"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=679006","abstract":"A new genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for digital filter design.

The differential global positioning system (DGPS) is one of the practical navigation tools used for this purpose. However, the DGPS has limitations arising from slow updates, signal interference, and limited accuracy. This paper describes how vehicle rate sensors ran be used to help a DGPS overcome these limitations. The theoretical background for the sensor fusion is based on the principle of Kalman filtering and a fuzzy logic scheme. Validity of the method was verified by using experimental data from an actual automobile navigating around an urban area. The results demonstrated that the path of the automobile can be continuously traced with high accuracy and repeatability, in spite of the limitations of the DGPS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679010/","volume":"45","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5933776","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accurate differential global positioning system via fuzzy logic Kalman filter sensor fusion technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate differential global positioning system via fuzzy logic Kalman filter sensor fusion technique","sourcePdf":"00679010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024365S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"61","articleId":"679010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":679011,"authors":[{"name":"S.

An isotropically conducting adhesive consists of metallic filler particles dispersed in the matrix of a polymer resin. Silver-filled epoxy resin is commonly used for thermal conduction in die attach applications. Silver particles can provide electrical and/or thermal conduction, while epoxy provides adhesive bonding of the components to a substrate. This material has several limitations when it is considered as a replacement for solder interconnections, such as low electrical conductivity, low joint strength, increase in contact resistance upon thermal cycling, lack of reworkability, and silver migration. In order to overcome these limitations, a new formulation is proposed based on alternative Pb-free conducting filler powder and tailored polymer resins. The conducting filler particles are coated with low melting point, nontoxic metals which can be fused to achieve metallurgical bonding between adjacent particles as well as to a substrate. This new conductive adhesive material has shown improved electrical and mechanical properties over the existing silver-filled epoxy materials.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679027/","volume":"21","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5928089","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Development of high conductivity lead (Pb)-free conducting adhesives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of high conductivity lead (Pb)-free conducting adhesives","sourcePdf":"00679027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030349S","chronDate":"Mar 1998","isNumber":"14928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"60","articleId":"679027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":679028,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Fundamental material characterizations were conducted on these materials, including thermal analysis [differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravitational analysis (TGA), and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA)] rheological, and dynamic mechanical analyses. Microstructural investigations [scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transverse electromagnetic (TEM), Auger] were performed to identify the silver flake size, distribution, and contact morphology. These analyses were related to the cure process and electrical conduction mechanisms of isotropically conductive adhesives (ICA's). The resistivity of these materials was monitored during cure and related to the cure kinetics of the epoxy matrix. The resistivity decreased dramatically (>k/spl Omega/ cm to m/spl Omega/ cm) around a specific temperature with ramp cure and over a narrow time range (<10 s) with isothermal cure. Successive heating (25-150/spl deg/C) and cooling cycles yielded different degrees of consecutive resistivity decreases for these materials which were cured according to the manufacturer's recommended schedules. Microstructure development during cure was studied with a hot stage in an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to relate morphological changes with the observed changes in resistance. No significant structural changes and silver flake movements were noticed during cure. The conduction development was accompanied by breakage and decomposition of the tarnish, organic thin layers which cover the silver flake surface, and by the enlargement of the contact area between silver flakes by thermal stress and shrinkage during the epoxy cure. The temperature coefficients of resistance (TCR) were measured for these materials; the TCR is closely related to a conduction mechanism dominated by constraint resistance between the flakes or by the silver flake metallic conduction. The resistivity and interfacial resistance of these materials with bare copper and gold plated pads (with five selected cure schedules) were measured through 85/spl deg/C/85% RH exposure up to 900 h. The bulk resistivity decreased in the first 100 h of exposure and did not change with humidity; however, the interfacial resistance increased with the copper pads for some materials. This is caused by the oxidation of the copper pads due to moisture attack.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/14928/00679028.pdf","doi":"10.1109/95.679028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.679028","startPage":"23","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Materials characterization, conduction development, and curing effects on reliability of isotropically conductive adhesives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679028/","displayDocTitle":"Materials characterization, conduction development, and curing effects on reliability of isotropically conductive adhesives","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5928090","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Materials characterization, conduction development, and curing effects on reliability of isotropically conductive adhesives","sourcePdf":"00679028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04102S","chronDate":"Mar 1998","isNumber":"14928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"63","articleId":"679028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":679038,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A traditional approach to combat this problem has been to introduce resynchronization markers in the transmitted bitstream. We propose an alternative, and more efficient, approach based on constraining the data length for the blocks or groups of blocks in the compressed image. In the proposed scheme the number of coded bits in each block, or group of blocks, is sent to the decoder as side information and thus the decoder can introduce resynchronization markers. The required overhead is significantly less than that of typical explicit synchronization schemes (e.g., those in JPEG). In addition, it is possible to further constrain the allowable rates for the blocks in order to reduce the overhead. We show experimental results where the constrained rate allocation is performed using thresholding techniques on images encoded by the baseline JPEG.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679054","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-First Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Specifically, we demonstrate that a CNN array using a simple nonlinear feedback template, with hysteresis, for each node, can perform arbitrary length binary addition with good performance in terms of stability and robustness. The processing speed can be controlled by changing the self-feedback value of the templates. We also propose a method for using the adder in binary multiplication.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679093","pdfPath":"/iel4/5559/14886/00679093.pdf","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1196 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-First Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Results are presented for wideband rail SAR measurements of reflectors in foliage, demonstrating resolution improvement and clutter rejection.

These filters satisfy the perfect reconstruction properties, namely, the paraunitary conditions, in the discrete frequency domain. The development of the PRCC framework has been motivated by the need for an efficient, invertible algorithm for the implementation of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based on bandlimited scaling functions and wavelets. As a motivation, we show how bandlimited scaling functions arise naturally in the context of interpolation and approximation sampling systems with the filters matched to the input process. Next, we show how the PRCC filter bank framework serves as a basis for a frequency sampled implementation of DWT based on bandlimited scaling functions and wavelets, and in general, of matched filters in the above sampling systems. Finally, we present simulation results using the PRCC framework which verify that the matched interpolating function gives the smallest mean squared error between the input and the reconstructed signal, as compared to other interpolating functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"6033330","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling systems matched to input processes and their implementation using PRCC filter banks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling systems matched to input processes and their implementation using PRCC filter banks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00679112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026621S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559","articleId":"679112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":679113,"authors":[{"name":"B.

To improve the reception of the signal of interest (SOI) and null interfering signals, the sample matrix inversion (SMI) algorithm uses a known training sequence in each TDMA burst to tune the weights of an antenna array. However, when the interfering burst overlaps the SOI data but not the SOI training sequence, SMI performance is degraded. To overcome this problem, the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), updated over the entire SOI burst, is used to enhance the SMI array weights. Simulations of a co-channel interference scenario demonstrate that SMI-CMA achieves higher output SINR than the SMI-zero forcing and SMI-adjacent burst algorithms for a large range of burst overlap cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679119/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6033337","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SMI based beamforming algorithms for TDMA signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMI based beamforming algorithms for TDMA signals","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00679119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026628S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559","citationCount":"2","articleId":"679119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":679120,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is well known that the decorrelating detector is an effective technique for separating signals of different users in bandwidth-efficient CDMA. For a general asynchronous CDMA channel, the output of the decorrelator for each user can be characterized by an equivalent single-user system with multiuser (MAI)-induced intersymbol interference (ISI). We investigate diversity combining techniques for this equivalent single-user channel using differential phase shift keying (DPSK) detection. This method does not require tracking of rapidly changing fading parameters. To improve the performance of the DPSK combiner, it can be beneficial to weigh the signals associated with different paths. We consider several criteria for choosing these weights. For the synchronous (ISI-free) channel, we show that the bit error rate (BER) of the optimal combiner can be closely approximated by a combination of two decorrelating detectors (with either noise whitening or signal whitening filters). We also discuss this \"hybrid\" approach for asynchronous channels with MAI-induced ISI. Finally, a minimum mean square error (MMSE) combiner is analyzed and compared to other techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679131","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-First Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

The transmitters send information independently with a power constraint so that X_ has a product distribution with E[|X/sub k/|/sup 2/]/spl les/P/sub k/. It is known that multiuser codes exist that will achieve any rate-tuple in the capacity region of the GMAC provided that an optimum joint decoder is used. However, little progress has been made in multiuser coding, and moreover, optimum joint decoding would be too complex. We restrict the decoder to be of a successive decoding type with equalization. Such a decoder is parameterized by feedforward and feedback equalization vectors. The optimum successive decoder (OSD) is obtained by maximizing the mutual information for each user over those vectors. The key result of this paper is that the OSD achieves the total capacity of the GMAC at any vertex of the capacity region. With the OSD, each transmitter can use a single-user code independently of the other users. The complexity of equalization is also only linear in the number of users. For the conventional GMAC, Y=/spl Sigma//sub i=1//sup M/ X/sub i/+N, where A is a row vector with unit elements, the OSD is degenerate and involves no equalization. It reduces to the well-known successive decoder for that channel as described by Wynter (1974) and Cover (1975). Furthermore, for the particular case of the uncoded channel, the OSD reduces to a new decision feedback multiuser detector. This detector is optimum in the sense that it maximizes signal-to-interference ratio for each user.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679134","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-First Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

It is well known that the traditional PCA algorithms, which are derived by using the gradient ascent technique on an objective function, are slow to converge. Furthermore, the convergence of these algorithms depends on the appropriate selection of the gain sequences. Since online applications demand faster convergence and an adaptive choice of the gains, we present new algorithms to solve these problems. We first present a new unconstrained objective function which can be maximized to obtain the PCA components. Adaptive algorithms are derived from this objective function by the use of the (1) gradient ascent, (2) conjugate direction, and the (3) Newton-Rhapson methods of optimization. Although the gradient ascent technique results in the well-known Xu (1993) algorithm, the conjugate direction and Newton-Rhapson methods produce two new algorithms for PCA. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian and real-world signal data show the faster convergence of the new algorithms over the traditional methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive algorithms for eigen-decomposition and their applications in CDMA communication systems","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-First Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

The second is a spatial-temporal version of the partial despreading LS (prds-LS) as proposed in Singh and Milstein (1997).

Circuits and Systems-I: Fundamental Theory and Applications, vol.44, no.5, 1997). Some advantages of the proposed approaches over existing related works are: (1) the design of the linear receiver does not require channel pre-estimation, (2) it is based on a simple decorrelation criterion that meets optimality in the noise free case, (3) it is robust to channel order mismatch, and finally, as usual in second-order methods, (4) it is not affected by the distance of the input distribution from Gaussianity (it works even with Gaussian or super-Gaussian sources). An adaptive algorithm is studied that is suitable for the processing of long data samples. A block-iterative counterpart is also introduced for the processing of short data sequences. The performances of these methods are evaluated over simulated data.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679173","endPage":"1608 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-First Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Then it enables the designer to incorporate these decisions into the architecture using behavioral synthesis. Matisse supports the diverse design practices required for commodity IC design by giving the designer fine-grain control of behavioral synthesis tasks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process design","Application specific integrated circuits","High level synthesis","Costs","Job shop scheduling","Resource management","Automatic control","Signal processing algorithms","Displays","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","circuit CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Matisse","architectural design tool","commodity ICs","behavioral synthesis","styles","protocols","delays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=679205","doi":"10.1109/54.679205","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/54/14951/00679205.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/54.679205","startPage":"22","endPage":"33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matisse: an architectural design tool for commodity ICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Matisse: an architectural design tool for commodity ICs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr-Jun 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr-Jun 1998","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April-June 1998","accessionNumber":"5948912","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matisse: an architectural design tool for commodity ICs","sourcePdf":"00679205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07259S","chronDate":"Apr-Jun 1998","isNumber":"14951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"14","articleId":"679205","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":679207,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The concurrent design of hardware and software has displaced traditional sequential design. Further, hardware and software design now begins before the system architecture (or even the specification) is finalised. System architects, customers, and marketing departments develop requirement definitions and system specifications together. System architects define a system architecture consisting of cooperating system functions that form the basis of concurrent hardware and software design. Interface design requires the participation of both hardware and software developers. The next step integrates and tests hardware and software-this phase consists of many individual steps. Reusing components taken from previous designs or acquired from outside the design group is a main design goal to improve productivity and reduce design risk. It is argued that new methodologies and AD tools support an integrated hardware software codesign process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codesign of embedded systems: status and trends","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","doi":"10.1109/54.679207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/54/14951/00679207.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/54.679207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14951","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=679207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr-Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr-Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"Codesign of embedded systems: status and trends","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April-June 1998","accessionNumber":"5948914","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codesign of embedded systems: status and trends","sourcePdf":"00679207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091383S","chronDate":"Apr-Jun 1998","isNumber":"14951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"100","articleId":"679207","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":679209,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Jong Fang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China"],"lastName":"Wen-Jong Fang","id":"37363629700"},{"name":"A.C.-H.

We identify three parameters of supernode transformation: supernode size, relative side lengths, and cutting hyperplane directions. For algorithms with perfectly nested loops and uniform dependencies, for sufficiently large supernodes and number of processors, and for the case where multiple supernodes are mapped to a single processor, we give an order n polynomial whose real positive roots include the optimal supernode size. For two special cases, 1) two-dimensional algorithm problems and 2) n-dimensional algorithm problems, where the communication cost is dominated by the startup penalty and, therefore, can be approximated by a constant, we give a closed form expression for the optimal supernode size, which is independent of the supernode relative side lengths and cutting hyperplanes. For the case where the algorithm iteration index space and the supernodes are hyperrectangular, we give closed form expressions for the optimal supernode relative side lengths. Our experiment shows a good match of the closed form expressions with experimental data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1998","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1998","accessionNumber":"5943850","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"On supernode transformation with minimized total running time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On supernode transformation with minimized total running time","sourcePdf":"00679213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052019S","chronDate":"May 1998","isNumber":"14952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"30","articleId":"679213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":679228,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The inspection system, which offers a scalable, open architecture, can be manufactured at relatively low cost using off-the-shelf components. While synchronized to the motion of the loom, the developed system first acquires very high-quality, vibration-free images of the fabric using either front or backlighting. Then the acquired images are subjected to a novel defect segmentation algorithm, which is based on the concepts of wavelet transform, image fusion and the correlation dimension. The essence of this segmentation algorithm is the localization of those events (i.e., defects) in the input images that disrupt the global homogeneity of the background texture. The efficacy of this algorithm, as well as the overall inspection system, has been tested thoroughly under realistic conditions. The system was used to acquire and to analyze more than 3700 images of fabrics that were constructed with two different types of yarn. In each case, the performance of the system was evaluated as an operator introduced defects from 26 categories into the weaving process. The overall detection rate of the presented approach was found to be 89% with a localization accuracy of 0.2 in.

In addition, it is crucial that adequate electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is achieved between the high-voltage pulse source and surrounding equipment. Pulsed corona (1.5 kW) is generated in a pilot unit that produces narrow 50 MW pulses at 1000 pps. The pilot unit can run continuously for use in industrial applications: cleaning of gases (100 m/sup 3//h) or fluids (e.g. waste water). Various chemical processes, such as toluene removal from an air flow are tested. To examine the processes in the reactor, the authors use current and voltage sensors and a fast CCD camera. They also developed a model to analyze the VOC conversion. Incorporated EMC techniques are based on the successful concept of constructing a low transfer impedance between common mode currents induced by pulsed power and differential mode voltages in signal lines and external mains AC.","doi":"10.1109/PPC.1997.679285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14895","startPage":"103","endPage":"108 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel4/5524/14895/00679285.pdf","publicationTitle":"Digest of Technical Papers. 11th IEEE International Pulsed Power Conference (Cat.

Traditional microactuators used in micropumps suffer from low strokes and, as a result, are unsuitable for achieving large fluid displacement. They also suffer low-actuation work densities, which translate to low forces. We investigate the use of the shape-memory effect (SMA) in sputter-deposited thin-film shape-memory alloy (SMA) titanium nickel (TiNi) as an actuator for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based microfluidic devices, as it is capable of both high force and high strains. The resistivity of the SMA thin film is suitable for Joule heating, which allows direct electrical control of the actuator. Two micropump designs were fabricated-one with a novel complementary actuator and the other with a polyimide-biased actuator-which provided thermal isolation between the heated microactuator and the fluid being pumped. A maximum water flow rate of 50 /spl mu/l/min was achieved.","doi":"10.1109/84.679390","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/14946/00679390.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.679390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin-film shape-memory alloy actuated micropumps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=679390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679390/","displayDocTitle":"Thin-film shape-memory alloy actuated micropumps","volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5951237","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin-film shape-memory alloy actuated micropumps","sourcePdf":"00679390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047348S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"280","articleId":"679390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":679393,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Two types of SAM coatings, derived from the precursor molecules octadecyltrichlorosilane [CH/sub 3/(CH/sub 2/)/sub 17/SiCl/sub 3/, OTS] and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane [CF/sub 3/(CF/sub 2/)/sub 7/(CH/sub 2/)/sub 2/SiCl/sub 3/, FDTS], were applied to polycrystalline silicon microstructures in a liquid-based process. Due to the hydrophobicity of these coatings, the water capillary forces responsible for the phenomenon known as release-related stiction are eliminated, and SAM-coated cantilever beams 2 /spl mu/m thick, 2 /spl mu/m above the substrate, and up to 2 mm in length emerge dry and free standing when removed from the final water rinse. The effects of SAM coating on adhesion encountered during device operation, termed in-use stiction, were characterized using arrays of cantilever beams of varying lengths. Structures made with a polycrystalline silicon of 3-nm rms roughness gave apparent works of adhesion of 30 and 8 /spl mu/J/m/sup 2/ for the OTS and FDTS SAM coatings, respectively, in comparison to 56 mJ/m/sup 2/ for standard oxide-coated structures. These results demonstrate that OTS coating reduces adhesion by more than three orders of magnitude over the conventional process and that the fluorinated SAM can lessen it further by four times. With regard to thermal stability, both SAM coatings can withstand heat treatment for 5 min at 450/spl deg/C in an N/sub 2/ ambient. In air, the OTS film begins to degrade at 150/spl deg/C while the fluorinated coating remains intact up to 400/spl deg/C. Therefore, both types of SAM coatings are compatible with several MEMS packaging techniques, with the FDTS monolayers exhibiting superior stiction and thermal stability properties to those derived from OTS. Furthermore, the FDTS formation does not require any chlorinated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, which has been banned from industrial use, making the latter coating an industrially viable antistiction treatment.","doi":"10.1109/84.679393","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/14946/00679393.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.679393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14946","startPage":"252","endPage":"260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alkyltrichlorosilane-based self-assembled monolayer films for stiction reduction in silicon micromachines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=679393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Alkyltrichlorosilane-based self-assembled monolayer films for stiction reduction in silicon micromachines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5951238","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alkyltrichlorosilane-based self-assembled monolayer films for stiction reduction in silicon micromachines","sourcePdf":"00679393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080164S","chronDate":"Jun 1998","isNumber":"14946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"360","articleId":"679393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":679396,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

These are characteristic of a class of problems that cannot be optimally solved because they involve hypothesis testing over hypothesis spaces with extremely large cardinality. Our multiscale hypothesis testing approach addresses the key issues associated with this class of problems. A multiscale hypothesis test is a hierarchical sequence of composite hypothesis tests that discards large portions of the hypothesis space with minimal computational burden and zooms in on the likely true hypothesis. For the anomaly detection and localization problems, hypothesis zooming corresponds to spatial zooming - anomalies are successively localized to finer and finer spatial scales. The key challenges we address include how to hierarchically divide a large hypothesis space and how to process the data at each stage of the hierarchy to decide which parts of the hypothesis space deserve more attention. For the latter, we pose and solve a nonlinear optimization problem for a decision statistic that maximally disambiguates composite hypotheses. With no more computational complexity, our optimized statistic shows substantial improvement over conventional approaches.

This problem is representative of a class of important imaging techniques such as interferometric synthetic aperture radar, optical interferometry, magnetic resonance imaging, and diffraction tomography. We follow a Bayesian approach; then, not only a probabilistic model of the observation mechanism, but also prior knowledge concerning the (phase) image to be reconstructed, are needed. We take as prior a nonsymmetrical half plane autoregressive (NSHP AR) Gauss-Markov random field (GMRF). Based on a reduced order state-space formulation of the (linear) NSHP AR model and on the (nonlinear) observation mechanism, a recursive stochastic nonlinear filter is derived, The corresponding estimates are compared with those obtained by the extended Kalman-Bucy filter, a classical linearizing approach to the same problem. A set of examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1998","accessionNumber":"5937315","pubMedId":"18276299","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Absolute phase image reconstruction: a stochastic nonlinear filtering approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Absolute phase image reconstruction: a stochastic nonlinear filtering approach","sourcePdf":"00679433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059876S","chronDate":"June  1998","isNumber":"14919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"36","articleId":"679433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":679434,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Although many algorithms have been proposed so far, their performance analysis has always been carried out assuming perfect receiver coefficients estimation and/or under time-invariant conditions. In this article, we present some decision-directed blind algorithms and use a time-varying vector channel simulator to compare their performance with those of many previously proposed algorithms. It is shown that decision-directed chip-level algorithms can operate without the use of training sequences to avoid catastrophic error propagation, and that one should not expect an increase in performance from using least squares instead of least-mean-square. Furthermore the unpracticability of the bit-level algorithm (Gerlach 1992) and of the least significant algorithm (Liu and Zoltowski 1997) under a time varying environment is outlined. The performance of the principal component (Stanford) algorithm (Naguib and Paulraj 1995) is also studied.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.679540","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Two blind deterministic ML (DML) strategies are presented. In the first one, we propose to modify the iterative quadratic ML (IQML) algorithm in order to \"denoise\" it and hence obtain consistent channel estimates. The second strategy, called pseudo-quadratic ML (PQML), is naturally asymptotically denoised. Links between these two approaches are established and their global convergence is proved. Furthermore, we propose semi-blind ML techniques combining PQML with two different training sequence estimation methods and compare their performance. These semi-blind techniques, exploiting the presence of known symbols, outperform their blind version. They also allow channel estimation in situations where blind and training sequence methods fail separately. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of all the proposed algorithms, and comparisons between them are discussed in a blind and/or semi-blind context.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.679541","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Using the desired signature code and the code orthogonal to it, a new code filter is introduced to decompose the received signals into two parts: desired information and interference. The above method motivates us to develop the QR-decomposition based dominant eigenmode search (QRD-DMS) algorithm which is more numerically stable than the DMS one. The corresponding wavefront systolic architecture is also proposed for the VLSI implementation.

In this paper, we develop type-based receivers that address two major issues in CDMA signal reception: multiple access interference and multipath fading. We first present the type-based receiver with interference suppression capability, assuming the knowledge of the code and timing of the intended user only. We then show that equal-gain combining (EGC) of type-based statistics is the asymptotically optimal technique for diversity empirical detection. Compared with maximal ratio combining of matched filter outputs, the diversity receiver with EGC of type-based statistics assumes less channel knowledge and yields competitive detection performance in Gaussian noise and better performance in Laplacian noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Finite memory approximations of these detectors require the inversion of a correlation matrix whose dimension is given by the product of the number of active users and the length of the processing window. With increasing number of active users or increasing length of the processing window, the calculation of the inverse may soon become numerically very expensive. In this paper, we prove that the decorrelating and the linear MMSE detector can both be realized by linear multi-stage interference cancellation algorithms with ideally an infinite number of stages. It is shown that for serial multi-stage interference cancellation, depending on the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of active users, only a few stages are necessary to obtain the same BER performance as the ideal detectors. Thus, the complexity can be reduced considerably.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

The systems are assumed to work in a flat fading and near-far environment, where an arbitrary antenna array is used at the receiver of the system to achieve the spatial diversity. The algorithm is derived by modeling the known training sequence as the desired signal and all other signals including the multiuser interfering signals and the additive noise as unknown colored Gaussian noise so that a knowledge of the number of active users is not required. We show that by utilizing the information collected via multiple antenna sensors, the length of the training sequences can be greatly reduced. We also show that the algorithm is an asymptotic maximum Likelihood estimator. As a result, the mean-squared error of the code-timing estimates obtained by the algorithm approaches the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) as the length of the training sequence increases. Moreover, the algorithm does not require the search over a parameter space and the code-timing is obtained by rooting a second-order polynomial, which is computationally very efficient.

The performance of DMT (OFDM) and DWMT (DSBMT) techniques for single and multitone interference are investigated. It is shown that a DMT system is sensitive to the location of narrow band interference. The DMT technique needs additional narrow band interference canceller before the forward FFT transform for performance improvements. In the DSBMT technique, due to a limited spectral overlap between its subcarriers, single (multi)-tone interference could affect only a few subchannels which correspond to these interferences. The DSBMT has a superior performance than DMT.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.679562","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

When the channel model is correct, our method is efficient, in the sense that it will achieve the \"optimal\" classification rate. When unknown contamination is present, our method can automatically overcome it to certain degree. At SNRs of 10 and 15 dB, examples of classifying two modulation types-QAM4 and PSK6-are given.

The following problem is solved: using the training sequence, find the maximum likelihood multichannel impulse response from one mobile to the base station under a reduced rank constraint in the presence of Gaussian noise and jammers with unknown covariance matrix. Our results find applications in equalization (the reduced rank channel estimate can be used in a Viterbi algorithm), and in the estimation of the directions of arrival (DOA) of the paths from the mobile to the base station.

Simulation results have shown significant improvement offered by the proposed optimal power assignment method.

The desire for further reduction in computational complexity has motivated signed-error versions of CMA, which have been found to lack the robustness properties of the CMA.

With minimal rate reduction, FIR filterbank transmitters with trailing zeros allow for perfect (in the absence of noise) equalization of FIR channels with FIR zero-forcing equalizer filterbanks, irrespective of the input color and the channel zero locations. Methods of exploiting input diversity, blind channel estimators, block synchronizers, and direct self-recovering equalizing filterbanks are derived. The resulting algorithms are computationally simple, require small data sizes, can be implemented online, and remain consistent (after appropriate modifications) even at low SNR colored noise. Simulations illustrate applications to multi-carrier modulation through channels with deep fades, and superior performance relative to the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and existing output diversity techniques relying on multiple antennas and fractional sampling.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

For example, it requires 512-point IFFT/FFT as the modulation/demodulation kernel. The large block size results in heavy computational load in running programmable DSP processors. It also makes VLSI implementation not feasible. We derive the parallel lattice structure for the IFFT/FFT based on the time-recursive approach.

A notable drawback of OFDM systems is their sensitivity to nonlinear distortion. For maximum power efficiency, amplifiers and transmitters of modern communication systems often operate near their saturation regions which leads to nonlinear distortion. We use the special property that the transmitted OFDM symbols are asymptotically white Gaussian to derive an algorithm that identifies the nonlinear channel. A nonlinear equalizer is built to compensate for the undesired nonlinearities. Simulation results show that the nonlinear equalizer outperforms its linear counterpart when nonlinear distortion is present.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.679627","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Our preliminary results suggest that the features collected by the adaptive splitting wavelet transform technique performed better compared to the other wavelet based techniques, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.67%, using either the minimum distance classifier or the least squares minimum distance classifier.

However, under non-optimum conditions, MFA processing is computationally costly, and may produce little improvement or even subjective quality degradation as compared with simple time delay compensation (TDC). Appropriate truncation of the MFA filter bank is shown to reduce the computational burden without significantly reducing the capture SNR. This work attempts to find an optimal truncation time with respect to room size, wall absorption and the number of microphones used for the system. Simulations were conducted to evaluate MFA performance as a function of truncation length as these parameters were varied in situations typical of teleconferencing applications. It was demonstrated that judicious MFA truncation allows a reduction in computation load without sacrificing capture SNR.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Array signal processing","Signal processing","Speech processing","Degradation","Delay effects","Filter bank","Absorption","Microphones","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","direction-of-arrival estimation","array signal processing","band-pass filters","filtering theory","teleconferencing","microphones","acoustic transducer arrays","speech processing","reverberation","architectural acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal truncation time","matched filter array processing","signal-to-noise","room transfer function","array speech capture","reverberant environments","subjective quality degradation","time delay compensation","MFA filter bank","capture SNR","room size","wall absorption","microphones","simulations","truncation length","teleconferencing applications","computation load reduction"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1998.679667","startPage":"3629","endPage":"3632 vol.6","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

The LPC coefficients and DWT coefficients are quantized using a novel bit allocation scheme which minimizes the overall quantization error with respect to the masking threshold.

A two-stream HMM is then obtained by combining the two single-stream HMMs and introducing exponents that weigh the log-likelihood of each stream.

Video is segmented into regions defined by shots, shot boundaries, and camera movement within shots. Features for segmentation include an image-based distance between adjacent video frames, an audio distance based on the acoustic difference in intervals just before and after the frames, and an estimate of motion between the two frames. Typical video segmentation algorithms classify shot boundaries by computing an image-based distance between adjacent frames and comparing this distance to fixed, manually determined thresholds. Motion and audio information is used separately. In contrast, our segmentation technique allows features to be combined within the HMM framework. Further, thresholds are not required since automatically trained HMMs take their place. This algorithm has been tested on a video data base, and has been shown to improve the accuracy of video segmentation over standard threshold-based systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hidden Markov model framework for video segmentation using audio and image features","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP '98 (Cat.

Load balancing algorithms to spread the requests across multiple Web servers are crucial to achieve the scalability. Various domain name server (DNS) based schedulers have been proposed in the literature, mainly for multiple homogeneous servers. The presence of heterogeneous Web servers not only increases the complexity of the DNS scheduling problem, but also makes previously proposed algorithms for homogeneous distributed systems not directly applicable. This leads us to propose new policies, cabled adaptive TTL algorithms, that take into account both the uneven distribution of client request rates and heterogeneity of Web servers to adaptively set the time-to-live (TTL) value for each address mapping request. Extensive simulation results show that these strategies are robust and effective in balancing load among geographically distributed heterogeneous Web servers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.1998.679729","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.1998.679729","startPage":"295","endPage":"302","pdfPath":"/iel4/5583/14954/00679729.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 18th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (Cat.

In this paper a solution to overcome the problem of temperature drift errors of conditioning circuits is proposed, As an example a thermocouple based temperature measurement system is considered and the stability of its conditioning circuit (AD595) is analysed in two cases: with and without temperature drift error compensation. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for data optimisation and a Virtual Instrument, using GPIB instrumentation, is used to collect experimental values.

In weak ac-systems, however, the line voltage can be distorted, and faulty zero-crossings can occur. Besides, in isolated power transmission networks, the line frequency can alter. For the detection of the true zero-crossings in such cases, we describe a neural network which is capable of tracking the true zero-crossing instants by utilizing the measurements of the three line voltage components in a three-phase power delivery system. The line voltages are measured with comparators, thus enabling low cost implementation. The network structure is extended by using a logic circuit which produces the time elapsed from the previous detected zero-crossing instant as a feedback signal for the network. The logic circuit is thus placed inside the network structure. Therefore, we can utilize the knowledge that the true zero-crossings occur at regular intervals in practical power delivery systems. The simulation results show that the proposed neural network provides competitive performance.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1998.679781","startPage":"280","endPage":"285 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IMTC/98 Conference Proceedings.

In this work we try demonstrate the suitability of this approach by showing two examples of virtual sensors (i.e. neural networks for variable estimation) developed for pressurized water reactor nuclear power plants. Questions addressed have been input variable selection, data normalization, network architecture optimization, training set sizing, etc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/679786/","accessionNumber":"6068879","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Virtual industrial sensors trough neural networks.

This paper describes an innovative load forecasting scheme employing the genetic algorithm (GA) embedded neural network. The new load forecasting technique is compared with the conventional artificial neural network approaches, which sometime suffer from the local minima optimization problem. Employing genetic algorithms on the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) allows parameters to be easily optimized. Furthermore, the artificial neural network requires a heavy trial-and-error design and training procedure which impairs the performances of the resulting load forecasting schemes. Using the genetic algorithm approach to construct the ANN results in significantly reduced trial-and-error effort in the training phase and produces a load forecasting scheme which is more efficient, adaptive, and optimized than that provided by traditional artificial neural network based approaches. The proposed genetic algorithm embedded artificial forecasting scheme has been tested with data obtained from a sample study performed on the Taiwan power system and the experimental evaluations have demonstrated adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed load forecasting scheme.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1998.679790","pdfPath":"/iel4/5565/14896/00679790.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"311 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IMTC/98 Conference Proceedings.

Experimental results indicated a conversion efficiency of -10 dB at a wavelength conversion frequency of 10 THz. To confirm this simulation result, we fabricated a basic OPD and measured the characteristics of wavelength conversion. These measurements gave a conversion efficiency of -22 dB (approx. -16 dB for the basic OPD itself) at a wavelength conversion frequency of 5 THz. Comparison of the simulation and experimental results suggested the possibility of high wavelength conversion efficiency even above 20 THz conversion frequency by optimizing the OPD structure.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1998.679881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1998.679881","startPage":"687","endPage":"692 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IMTC/98 Conference Proceedings.
