In model-driven engineering, DSE is applied to find instance models that are (i) reachable from an initial model with a sequence of transformation rules and (ii) satisfy a set of structural and numerical constraints. Since exhaustive exploration of the design space is infeasible for large models, the traversal is often guided by hints, derived by system analysis, to prioritize the next states to traverse (selection criteria) and to avoid searching unpromising states (cut-off criteria). In this paper, we define an exploration approach where selection and cut-off criteria are defined using dependency analysis of transformation rules and an algebraic abstraction. The approach is evaluated against other exploration techniques and illustrated on a cloud infrastructure configuration problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100051/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12426849","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A model-driven framework for guided design space exploration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model-driven framework for guided design space exploration","confLoc":"Lawrence, KS, USA","sourcePdf":"p173hegedues.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078494S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093623","isNumber":"6100039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093623","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6100039","articleId":"6100051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6100061,"authors":[{"name":"Chengnian Sun","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chengnian","lastName":"Sun","id":"38024668600"},{"name":"David Lo","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lo","id":"37399959800"},{"name":"Siau-Cheng Khoo","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Siau-Cheng","lastName":"Khoo","id":"37400061000"},{"name":"Jing Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37537186000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1639-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1638-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1938-4300"}],"articleNumber":"6100061","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Accuracy","Computer bugs","Tuning","Information retrieval","Support vector machines","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","information retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","program debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bug tracking system","duplicate bug reports","retrieval function","textual similarity","BM25F","information retrieval community","duplicate report retrieval","two-round stochastic gradient descent","REP","supervised learning","software bug repositories"]}],"abstract":"In a bug tracking system, different testers or users may submit multiple reports on the same bugs, referred to as duplicates, which may cost extra maintenance efforts in triaging and fixing bugs. In order to identify such duplicates accurately, in this paper we propose a retrieval function (REP) to measure the similarity between two bug reports. It fully utilizes the information available in a bug report including not only the similarity of textual content in summary and description fields, but also similarity of non-textual fields such as product, component, version, etc. For more accurate measurement of textual similarity, we extend BM25F - an effective similarity formula in information retrieval community, specially for duplicate report retrieval. Lastly we use a two-round stochastic gradient descent to automatically optimize REP for specific bug repositories in a supervised learning manner. We have validated our technique on three large software bug repositories from Mozilla, Eclipse and OpenOffice. The experiments show 10-27% relative improvement in recall rate@k and 17-23% relative improvement in mean average precision over our previous model. We also applied our technique to a very large dataset consisting of 209,058 reports from Eclipse, resulting in a recall rate@k of 37-71% and mean average precision of 47%.","doi":"10.1109/ASE.2011.6100061","publicationTitle":"2011 26th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 26th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093623/6100039/06100061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100039","startPage":"253","endPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards more accurate retrieval of duplicate bug reports","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards more accurate retrieval of duplicate bug reports","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100061/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12426858","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100061/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards more accurate retrieval of duplicate bug reports","confLoc":"Lawrence, KS, USA","sourcePdf":"p253sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098168S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093623","isNumber":"6100039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093623","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6100039","articleId":"6100061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6100177,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiong Gu","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

In this work, we present new techniques for realizing highly adaptive and reliable clock distribution for 3D ICs. Firstly, an efficient clock distribution topology without need of balanced H-tree is proposed. Secondly, a robust tunable-delay-buffer (TDB) circuit and a novel active de-skew method are developed in order to handle the cross-die variations, thermal gradients, and wiring asymmetry. Moreover, a design optimization flow is constructed for improving the adaptive clock design based on the thermal profiles. Experiment results show that the clock skews are significantly reduced using the proposed techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100195/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12471117","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive clock distribution for 3D integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive clock distribution for 3D integrated circuits","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"041G02Chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07661S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088024","isNumber":"6100155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088024","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6100155","articleId":"6100195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6100196,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Braunisch","affiliation":["Components Research, Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Braunisch","id":"37267880200"},{"name":"Aleksandar Aleksov","affiliation":["Components Research, Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Aleksov","id":"37324007100"},{"name":"Stefanie Lotz","affiliation":["Components Research, Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Stefanie","lastName":"Lotz","id":"37589447100"},{"name":"Johanna Swan","affiliation":["Components Research, Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Johanna","lastName":"Swan","id":"38052790300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9401-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9400-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4115"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4107"}],"articleNumber":"6100196","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":1319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Silicon","Integrated circuit interconnections","Routing","Solid modeling","Crosstalk","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","chip scale packaging","elemental semiconductors","high-speed integrated circuits","integrated circuit interconnections","silicon","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon bridge die-to-die interconnects","multichip packaging architecture","die-to-die interconnect density","electrical high-speed performance simulations","two-dimensional electromagnetic modeling","three-dimensional electromagnetic modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high-speed channels","multiconductor transmission lines","signal integrity","electronic packages","3D interconnects","3D packages"]}],"abstract":"Silicon Bridge is a dense multichip packaging architecture that enables high die-to-die interconnect density and corresponding applications.

In this paper, an image coding method based on EBCOT algorithm and multiwavelet transform was proposed. During our research, a variety of commonly-used multiwavelets were used to combine with EBCOT algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method is a valuable attempt of image compression.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100255/06100323.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"610","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An image coding method based on multiwavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Transform coding","Low pass filters","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","vectors","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding method","multiwavelet transform","scalar wavelet","vector space","image processing","EBCOT algorithm","image compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image coding","multiwavelet transform","EBCOT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An image coding method based on multiwavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6100323/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439171","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An image coding method based on multiwavelet transform","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070059S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6100255","articleId":"6100323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6100360,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Hsuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of communication engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ho-Hsuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37068306800"},{"name":"Jin-Shing Shia","affiliation":["Military education division, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Shing","lastName":"Shia","id":"38235282600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100360","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100360","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Noise","Strontium","Noise measurement","Interpolation","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image registration","image restoration","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise removal","blur removal","multiframe super resolution reconstruction","multiple low resolution frames","ill posed minimization problem","high resolution grids","pixelwise time average"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["super-resolution","image reconstruction","registration","anisotropic diffusion","pixelwise time average"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100360","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100255/06100360.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach of joint noise and blur removal for multiframe super-resolution reconstruction","abstract":"The reconstruction of a super-resolution (SR) image from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames has drawn a lot of research attention over the past years. The SR reconstruction is an inherent ill-posed minimization problem. Though regularization constraint may be accomplished to derive a single solution, to implement a traditional approach which the data fusing is processed at high-resolution (HR) grids may still be a great challenge due to complexity as well as high computing load. In this paper we introduce a new approach which both the blur and noise removal would be simultaneously carried out at the LR grids by taking pixelwise time average upon the available LR frames after registration. This approach is characterized by simplicity and real-time applicability, and the simulation results demonstrate that the compatible performance can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100360/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12439208","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new approach of joint noise and blur removal for multiframe super-resolution reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach of joint noise and blur removal for multiframe super-resolution reconstruction","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045129S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","xplore-issue":"6100255","articleId":"6100360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6100369,"authors":[{"name":"Ruihua Liang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and System Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ruihua","lastName":"Liang","id":"38030269300"},{"name":"Zaixin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and System Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zaixin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37088304911"},{"name":"Shengguo Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shengguo","lastName":"Li","id":"37088311047"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100369","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Dictionaries","Noise reduction","Wavelet domain","Image denoising","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","sparse matrices","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising algorithm","redundant dictionary","double sparsity model","zero-tree structure","wavelet domain","training vectors","wavelet coefficients","high-frequency subbands","signal dimension","over fitting problem","learned dictionary"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100369","abstract":"A novel image denoising algorithm is proposed.

Spiking neural networks inherit intrinsically parallel mechanism from biological system. A massively parallel implementation technology is required to simulate them. To address this issue, modern Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which have parallel array of streaming multiprocessors, allow many thousands of lightweight threads to be run, is proposed and proved as a pertinent solution.

Results show that at the same compression rate the application of optimized neural network in image compression will achieve better image quality compared with the application of traditional neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100502/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12439339","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6100502/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A back-propagation neural network based on a hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization for image compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A back-propagation neural network based on a hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization for image compression","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05607S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6100391","articleId":"6100502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6100507,"authors":[{"name":"Baoyuan Han","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of High Reliable Embedded System, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Baoyuan","lastName":"Han","id":"38195238800"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Shang","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of High Reliable Embedded System, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Shang","id":"37310174200"},{"name":"Zhao Xiaoxu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Xiaoxu","id":"37086895254"},{"name":"Hou Xuefeng","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of High Reliable Embedded System, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hou Xuefeng","id":"37086893932"},{"name":"Song Hongchao","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of High Reliable Embedded System, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Song Hongchao","id":"37086893388"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100507","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":640},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS integrated circuits","Libraries","Computational modeling","Arrays","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS imaging sensor","Simulink","complementary metal oxide semiconductor","charge-coupled device","noise performance","noise sources","CMOS imager","noise level","SIMULINK","LUPA4000","sensor parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","Image sensor","SIMULINK","modeling"]}],"abstract":"The CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) image sensor becomes increasingly competitive with respect to CCD (the charge-coupled device) except the noise performance.

This paper introduces the method of modeling and simulation of CMOS imaging sensor based on SIMULINK. The CMOS imager sensor used in the simulation is LUPA4000 fabricated by Cypress Corporation. Based on this model, parameters of the sensor can be modified and simulation results are then showed clearly. The validity of the model is also confirmed in the last part of this paper.

Improving the visibility of input images on a target detection system is necessary to insure detection work properly. Compared to other realization methods based on DSPs and FPGAs, this paper proposes a totally parallel structure based on FPGA to implement multi-scale Retinex for an outdoor application. Gaussian kernel is optimized with address encoding and distributed arithmetic, and parallel multi-scale convolutions are realized. No frame buffer is needed for the proposed implementation itself, so the system delay is greatly saved. Experiments show the good performance of the proposed multi-scale Retinex implementation by both subjective and objective assessments. Visibility of images suffering from fog degradation and uneven light is improved.

Usually, the naked eye of the people cannot perceive any change when the image is modified slightly. The evaluation of data hiding schemes should be measured by the distortion (or called Mean Square Error; MSE) and the embedding rate (the average number of bits embedded in a cover pixel). In this paper, we propose two improved data hiding schemes. One is to improve the EMD (Exploiting Modification Direction)-based data hiding algorithm to have higher stego-image quality. The other is to improve the Matrix encoding-based data hiding algorithm by using the idea of Hamming+1 to further improve the stego-image quality. Both proposed improved schemes are verified to be correct through the theoretical analysis and the experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100527/06100652.pdf","startPage":"1784","endPage":"1787","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two improved data hiding schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Equations","Payloads","Image quality","Linear code","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hamming codes","image coding","steganography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data hiding scheme","information hiding","mean square error","embedding rate","exploiting modification direction scheme","stego-image quality","matrix encoding-based data hiding","Hamming+1 code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EMD","matrix encoding","magic matrix","(5,3) linear code","linear block code","data hiding","information hiding","Hamming+1","distortion","embedding rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Two improved data hiding schemes","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6100652/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439477","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two improved data hiding schemes","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062373S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6100527","articleId":"6100652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6100665,"authors":[{"name":"Xiwen Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Xiwen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37579002400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100665","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100665","abstract":"Linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) equalization and decision feedback equalization (DFE) are effective to mitigate the effect of intersymbol interference (ISI) in one dimensional (1-D) ISI channels.

In this framework a sparse approximated signal is obtained with samples much less than that required by the Nyquist sampling theorem if the signal is sparse on one basis. Encouraged by its exciting potential application in signal compression, we use CS framework for speech synthesis problems. The linear prediction coding (LPC) is an efficient tool for speech compression, as the speech is considered to be an AR process. It is also known that a speech signal is quasi-periodic in its voiced parts, hence a discrete fourier transform (DFT) basis will provide a better approximation. Thus we propose a hybrid dictionary combined with the LPC model and the DFT model as the basis of speech signal. The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is employed in our simulations to compute the sparse representation in the hybrid dictionary domain. The results indicate good performance with our proposed scheme, offering a satisfactory perceptual quality.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100691","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100662/06100691.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100662","startPage":"2400","endPage":"2403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing framework for speech signal synthesis using a hybrid dictionary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing framework for speech signal synthesis using a hybrid dictionary","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100691/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439508","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100691/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing framework for speech signal synthesis using a hybrid dictionary","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1468.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097268S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6100662","articleId":"6100691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6100702,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37313616100"},{"name":"Fanshui Lu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Fanshui","lastName":"Lu","id":"38238221000"},{"name":"Xingqun Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xingqun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38184454400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100702","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"abstract":"Coordinate transform is the core technology in Digital Scan Conversion (DSC) of B-mode ultrasonic, and its speed mostly determines the frame rate of B-mode imaging. In the traditional coordinate transform process, ultrasonic echo data is converted from polar coordinate to rectangular directly; the process is time-consuming and the data is unsuitable for post-treatment. In this paper, we employed the CORDIC Algorithm in coordinate transform. We compared the conventional radix-2 CORDIC algorithm with the improved radix-4 CORDIC algorithm and found the later saved half iterations at the same frequency. What's more, radix-4 CORDIC algorithm had smaller hardware consumption when using the pipelined structure. These results revealed that radix-4 CORDIC is an excellent method for high-speed DSC of B-mode ultrasonic.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echo","signal processing","transforms","ultrasonic applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["B mode ultrasonic digital scan conversion","DSC","B-mode imaging","ultrasonic echo data","coordinate transform","improved radix-4 CORDIC algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coordinate transform","DSC","radix-4 CORDIC algorithm","FPGA architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100702","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100702","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100662/06100702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100702","startPage":"2683","endPage":"2686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100662","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The efficient realization of B mode ultrasonic Digital Scan Conversion based on radix-4 CORDIC Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The efficient realization of B mode ultrasonic Digital Scan Conversion based on radix-4 CORDIC Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100702/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6100702/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439519","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The efficient realization of B mode ultrasonic Digital Scan Conversion based on radix-4 CORDIC Algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089116S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6100662","articleId":"6100702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6100707,"authors":[{"name":"Jinming Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406493100"},{"name":"Geng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Geng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38239312100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100707","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Training","Speaker recognition","Vectors","Neural networks","Probabilistic logic","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","smoothing methods","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker recognition","probabilistic neural network","PNN","smoothing parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probabilistic Neural Network(PNN)","Smoothing Parameter","Speaker recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100707","abstract":"Probabilistic Neural Network(PNN) is considered a good speaker recognition method, but, the recognition performance of PNN is greatly depends on the selection of smoothing parameter.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical signal processing technology that can get higher-order statistical independent and non-Gaussian components. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed, which is used to reduce the multiple access interference (MAI) in the direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. In order to solve the issues that the objective function falls into the local optimum, this paper utilizes the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the fast fixed-point algorithm (PSO-ICA) to improve the classical independent component analysis algorithm. The experimental results show that the PSO-ICA algorithm has the advantages of smaller bit error rate than the traditional algorithm. The PSO-ICA algorithm is more suitable for applications in the DS-CDMA system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100662/06100734.pdf","startPage":"2490","endPage":"2493","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user detection of DS-CDMA based on PSO-ICA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Independent component analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","independent component analysis","particle swarm optimisation","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","DS-CDMA","particle swarm optimization","PSO-ICA algorithm","independent component analysis","optimization techniques","statistical signal processing technology","multiple access interference","MAI","direct sequence code division multiple access systems","fast fixed-point algorithm","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["independent component analysis","particle swarm optimization","DS-CDMA","multi-user detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user detection of DS-CDMA based on PSO-ICA","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6100734/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439550","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user detection of DS-CDMA based on PSO-ICA","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083907S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","xplore-issue":"6100662","articleId":"6100734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6100735,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Wu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Wu","id":"38241016300"},{"name":"Weihua Zhao","affiliation":["Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Weihua Zhao","id":"38239187400"},{"name":"Jiawei Wu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Wu","id":"38239438700"},{"name":"Aijun Ou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Aijun","lastName":"Ou","id":"38235307400"},{"name":"Jinming Yu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jinming Yu","id":"37404159900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100735","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","MIMO","Doppler effect","Channel models","Scattering","Wireless communication","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler effect","electromagnetic wave scattering","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless channel model","scattering MIMO channel model","dynamic MIMO scattering channel model","Doppler effect","outdoor wireless MIMO scattering channel","transceiver antenna","frequency shift","spatial correction matrix","channel matrix","probability density distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler effect","MIMO","dynamic","channel modeling","capacity"]}],"abstract":"This article gives a scattering MIMO channel model based on dynamic MIMO scattering channel model considering Doppler effect.

It is necessary to take Doppler effect into account, when the mobile terminal is moving quickly.

Methods: eight professional cyclists participated in this study. Each subject performed 60-second all-out cycling exercise for one time and the sEMG of RF was recorded during the process. The braking torque imposed on cycling motion was 8% of each subject's weight. Combined with time-domain, flourier transform, wavelet packet transformation and nonlinear analysis method, RMS, MPF, MNF and nonlinear Lempel-Ziv complexity C(n) were calculated. Sensitivity and stability of each index in evaluating muscle fatigue of RF caused by all-out cycling exercise was compared and analyzed. Results: MPF?MNF and C(n) all decreased during muscle fatigue, having significant negative correlations with cycling exercise endurance time and significant positive correlations with pedaling rate and power output. MNF was found to have the highest fatigue sensitivity while RMS had the lowest fatigue sensitivity. The sensitivity of MPF and C(n) had no significant difference. As refer to stability, C(n) was the optimum index and MNF the second, followed by MPF and RMS. Conclusions: During all-out cycling exercise process, RF did vigorous dynamic contraction, making sEMG collected from the surface of RF nonlinear and non-stationary. The index of MNF based on wavelet packet transformation and the index of Lempel-Ziv complexity C(n) based on nonlinear analysis demonstrated high utility, suggesting the potential application of these methods as fatigue indices in evaluating muscle fatigue caused by all-out cycling exercise.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100751","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100662/06100751.pdf","startPage":"2779","endPage":"2783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity and stability analysis of sEMG indices in evaluating muscle fatigue of Rectus Femoris caused by all-out cycling exercise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100751/","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity and stability analysis of sEMG indices in evaluating muscle fatigue of Rectus Femoris caused by all-out cycling exercise","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439567","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6100751/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity and stability analysis of sEMG indices in evaluating muscle fatigue of Rectus Femoris caused by all-out cycling exercise","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.216751S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088936","isNumber":"6100662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088936","xplore-issue":"6100662","articleId":"6100751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6100756,"authors":[{"name":"Yankai Xu","affiliation":["College of Geophysics and Information Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yankai","lastName":"Xu","id":"37897052500"},{"name":"Kai Shuang","affiliation":["College of Geophysics and Information Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Shuang","id":"37296292200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9306-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9304-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9305-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100756","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Finite impulse response filter","Filtering theory","Receivers","Equations","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","field programmable gate arrays","matched filters","mathematics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high order matched filter","FPGA chip","deterministic signal","Matlab","Simulink","distributed arithmetic based high-order matched filter","field programmable gate array device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matched filter","Simulation","implementation","FPGA","distributed arithmetic"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of high order matched filter on a FPGA chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100756","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2011.6100756","startPage":"2526","endPage":"2530","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088936/6100662/06100756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2011.6100756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100662","abstract":"The paper reviews derivation of matched filter.

This approach combines feed- forward and feedback control running at 1 kHz and 40 Hz, respectively. The feed-forward control is based on an inverse dynamics model which is learned using Gaussian process regression to account for the robot's body dynamics and external influences. For evaluation the learned model is used to control the robot purely feed-forward as well as in combination with a slow feedback controller. Both approaches are compared to a basic feedback PD-controller with respect to their tracking ability in experiments. It is shown, that the combined approach yields good results and outperforms the basic feedback controller when applied to the same set-point trajectories for the leg joints.","doi":"10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100879","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","pdfPath":"/iel5/6086637/6100798/06100879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100798","startPage":"395","endPage":"400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired motion control of the musculoskeletal BioBiped1 robot based on a learned inverse dynamics model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired motion control of the musculoskeletal BioBiped1 robot based on a learned inverse dynamics model","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100879/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461025","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100879/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired motion control of the musculoskeletal BioBiped1 robot based on a learned inverse dynamics model","confLoc":"Bled, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"Paper152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073487S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086637","isNumber":"6100798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086637","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6100798","articleId":"6100879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6100882,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Ott","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Ott","id":"37282440400"},{"name":"Maximo A.

Infants, for example, pay stronger attention to the features of objects highlighted by parents and learn the way of manipulating an object while being supported by parents. In this paper, a robot with the basic ability of reaching for an object, closing fingers and lifting its hand lacks knowledge of which parts of the object affords grasping, and in which hand orientation should the object be grasped. During reach and grasp attempts, the movement of the robot hand is modified by the human caregiver's physical interaction to enable successful grasping. The object regions that the robot fingers contact first are detected and stored as potential graspable object regions along with the trajectory of the hand. In the experiments, we showed that although the human caregiver did not directly show the graspable regions, the robot was able to find regions such as handles of the mugs after its action execution was partially guided by the human. Later, this experience was used to find graspable regions of never seen objects. At the end, the robot was able to grasp objects based on the position of the graspable part and stored action execution trajectories.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100890","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","pdfPath":"/iel5/6086637/6100798/06100890.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"486","doi":"10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to grasp with parental scaffolding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning to grasp with parental scaffolding","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461036","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100890/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to grasp with parental scaffolding","confLoc":"Bled, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"Paper175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089058S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086637","isNumber":"6100798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086637","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6100798","articleId":"6100890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6100915,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoya Tamei","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Tamei","id":"37540587300"},{"name":"Takamitsu Matsubara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Takamitsu","lastName":"Matsubara","id":"37533262700"},{"name":"Akshara Rai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Akshara","lastName":"Rai","id":"38232366300"},{"name":"Tomohiro Shibata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Shibata","id":"37536760800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-868-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-866-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-867-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-0580"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-0572"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2164-0572"}],"articleNumber":"6100915","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1003},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6100915","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Clothing","Topology","Trajectory","Neck","Learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handicapped aids","learning (artificial intelligence)","manipulators","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning","robotic clothing assistance","dual-arm robot","assisted person posture","T-shirt clothing assistance","arm motion","elderly people","disabled people"]}],"abstract":"This study aims at robotic clothing assistance as it is yet an open field for robotics despite it is one of the basic and important assistance activities in daily life of elderly as well as disabled people. The clothing assistance is a challenging problem since robots must interact with non-rigid clothes generally represented in a high-dimensional space, and with the assisted person whose posture can vary during the assistance. Thus, the robot is required to manage two difficulties to perform the task of the clothing assistance: 1) handling of non-rigid materials and 2) adaptation of the assisting movements to the assisted person's posture. To overcome these difficulties, we propose to use reinforcement learning with the cloth's state which is low-dimensionally represented in topology coordinates, and with the reward defined in the low-dimensional coordinates. With our developed experimental system, for T-shirt clothing assistance, including an anthropomorphic dual-arm robot and a soft mannequin, we demonstrate the robot quickly learns a suitable arm motion for putting the mannequin's head into a T-shirt.","doi":"10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100915","publicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots","pdfPath":"/iel5/6086637/6100798/06100915.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement learning of clothing assistance with a dual-arm robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6100915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement learning of clothing assistance with a dual-arm robot","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6100915/","accessionNumber":"12461061","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement learning of clothing assistance with a dual-arm robot","confLoc":"Bled, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"Paper214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070998S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6086637","isNumber":"6100798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6086637","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6100798","articleId":"6100915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6100947,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Zhao","affiliation":["IKT, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537997600"},{"name":"Malte Schellmann","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, European Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Malte","lastName":"Schellmann","id":"37296008500"},{"name":"Houcine Boulaaba","affiliation":["IKT, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Houcine","lastName":"Boulaaba","id":"38232624600"},{"name":"Egon Schulz","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, European Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Egon","lastName":"Schulz","id":"37266353400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-92-61-13671-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1148-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-92-61-13681-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6100947","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":663},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Switches","Antennas","Buildings","TV","Europe","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","building management systems","cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency interference","ray tracing","television"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive LTE-femtocell","TV white space","residential building","ray tracing method","computer simulation","indoor coverage solution","power leakage","system performance prediction","femtocell interference study","shot-noise process","interference-avoiding antenna scheme","femto-equipped building"]}],"abstract":"As one of the future indoor coverage solutions, this paper considers the cognitive Femtocell for LTE system [1], which can opportunistically access the TV white spaces.

This paper proposes a prototype radar system for level crossing obstruction detection which utilises the Multiple In Multiple Out principle. The radar system to be used is an FMCW radar which operates at 24.225 GHz. The millimetre operating wavelength enables a small MIMO patch antenna array for the radar system to be fabricated on the same substrate. The radar will also be mounted at a height of 4m looking downwards onto the crossing which will require ground clutter cancellation. The MIMO antenna array layout which shows the element positions and the beampattern from its associated virtual array is shown. A short description of the proposed radar system hardware layout is then given. The signal processing algorithm, which consists of Digital Beamforming and clutter removal, is discussed in the following section. Plans for further work to develop the radar system are provided at the end of the paper.","publicationTitle":"2011 8th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088026/6100963/06101049.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Railway level crossing obstruction detection using MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101049/","displayDocTitle":"Railway level crossing obstruction detection using MIMO radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12471227","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101049/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Railway level crossing obstruction detection using MIMO radar","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051241S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088026","isNumber":"6100963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088026","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6100963","articleId":"6101049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101055,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Kasra Garakoui","affiliation":["ICD Group, EWI Faculty, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Seyed Kasra","lastName":"Garakoui","id":"37543131900"},{"name":"Eric A.M.

This allowed us to demonstrate the potentialities of a WiFi-based PBR for local area surveillance applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Spread spectrum communication","Modulation","Doppler effect","Passive radar","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","passive radar","spread spectrum communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive bistatic radar","mixed DSSS transmission","OFDM WiFi transmission","PBR","data processing steps","signal ambiguity function control","sidelobe level","undesired signal contribution removal","dynamic range","IEEE 802.11 access point","local area surveillance applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive radar","wireless networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101079","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088026/6100963/06101079.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100963","publicationTitle":"2011 8th European Radar Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive Bistatic Radar based on mixed DSSS and OFDM WiFi transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Passive Bistatic Radar based on mixed DSSS and OFDM WiFi transmissions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101079/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101079/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12471257","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive Bistatic Radar based on mixed DSSS and OFDM WiFi transmissions","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054862S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088026","isNumber":"6100963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088026","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6100963","articleId":"6101079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6101095,"authors":[{"name":"Marlene Harter","affiliation":["Wireless Sensor & RF-Technology (CT T DE HW 1), Siemens AG, Munchen, Germany","Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Marlene","lastName":"Harter","id":"37588197000"},{"name":"Andreas Ziroff","affiliation":["Wireless Sensor & RF-Technology (CT T DE HW 1), Siemens AG, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ziroff","id":"37298743700"},{"name":"Thomas Zwick","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zwick","id":"37273510500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-025-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1156-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6101095","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":901},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Radar imaging","Transmitters","Receivers","Three dimensional displays","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","CW radar","FM radar","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional radar imaging method","FMCW approach","orthogonal arrangement","transmit antenna arrays","receive antenna arrays","angular information","azimuth","elevation","three-dimensional space","two-dimensional beamforming","digital beamforming radar sensor","receiver channels","transmitter channels","frequency 24 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a three-dimensional radar imaging method is presented which combines the FMCW approach for range measurement with digital beamforming in two dimensions.

The subcarrier allocation and the corresponding power allocation are capable of leveraging the merits of WPM-based multi-user systems to improve system channel capacity. However, the resource allocation in WPM-based systems has never been investigated. Hence we propose in this paper the first resource allocation scheme for WPM-based Cognitive Radio (CR) systems. In our WPM-based CR systems, a Base Station (BS) serves several Secondary Users (SU) in idle or busy bands. The interference imposed on PUs by SUs in busy bands is restricted to a threshold. In fast fading multipath channels, the rapid fading variation may cause inaccurate Channel State Information (CSI) estimation which will lead to the improper resource allocation. To deal with this, our scheme involves two steps - real-time Channel State Information (CSI) estimation and CSI prediction for the next time slot. To timely capture CSI information, the former step exploits the Least Square Means (LSM) estimator. To accurately predict CSI, the latter step employs Kalman filters. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme is efficient regarding frequency selective fast fading.","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101298","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093763/6101292/06101298.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101298","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation using Kalman filters in busy and idle bands for WPM-based Cognitive Radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation using Kalman filters in busy and idle bands for WPM-based Cognitive Radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101298/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101298/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441234","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation using Kalman filters in busy and idle bands for WPM-based Cognitive Radio systems","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"scvt2011paper04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071921S","chronDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093763","isNumber":"6101292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093763","xplore-issue":"6101292","articleId":"6101298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101299,"authors":[{"name":"Aamir Habib","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Aamir","lastName":"Habib","id":"37529532600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1289-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1288-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1287-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0854"}],"articleNumber":"6101299","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Random variables","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple polarized MIMO","antenna subset selection","dual-polarized antennas","multiple-input multiple-output","triple-polarized MIMO systems","maximum ratio combining receivers","cross-polar discrimination","outage probabilities","transmit/receive antenna selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna Selection","XPD","dual-polarized","triple-polarized","Antenna selection gain","Outage probability"]}],"abstract":"Antenna subset selection in combination with dual-polarized antennas offers a better solution for compact and low-complexity devices using higher order Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). In this paper we provide another degree of freedom to the existing dual-polarized MIMO and analyze the performance of antenna selection for triple-polarized MIMO systems with maximum ratio combining receivers. We theoretically analyze the impact of cross-polar discrimination on the achieved antenna selection gain for both dual and triple-polarized MIMO for non line of sight channels. We proceed to derive the outage probabilities and observe that these systems achieve significant performance gains for compact configurations with only a nominal increase in complexity. We observe that at higher cross polarization discrimination and lower transmit signal to noise ratio, the outage performance for a dual-polarized system is almost the same as triple-polarized system with joint transmit/receive antenna selection. With selection at only one end of the link, the triple-polarized system performs better than dual-polarized counterpart at higher values of transmit SNRs. We also found out that the available degrees of freedom significantly increase with lower values of cross polarization discrimination.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple polarized MIMO with antenna selection","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101299","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093763/6101292/06101299.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple polarized MIMO with antenna selection","conferenceDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101299/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441235","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple polarized MIMO with antenna selection","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"scvt2011paper05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118134S","chronDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093763","isNumber":"6101292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093763","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6101292","articleId":"6101299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101300,"authors":[{"name":"Dieter Duyck","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information processing, Ghent University, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Duyck","id":"37392247900"},{"name":"Joseph J.

Full-diversity error-correcting codes are required to approach the physical limits of the performance on BF channels. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are good error-correcting codes, but full-diversity standard random LDPC codes for the BF channel are not known yet. We design full-diversity random LDPC ensembles at infinite block length by optimizing the threshold in multiple points in the fading space, which takes into account the randomness of the fading. However, this is not sufficient to achieve full-diversity at finite block length, because of stopping sets. We therefore propose a method to generate full-diversity code instances at finite length so that stopping sets over information bits are avoided. The asymptotic and finite length word error rate performance is verified by means of density evolution and Monte Carlo simulations, respectively, confirming that full-diversity standard random LDPC codes exist and perform well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full diversity random LDPC codes","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101300","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101292","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093763/6101292/06101300.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Full diversity random LDPC codes","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101300/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441236","conferenceDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full diversity random LDPC codes","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"scvt2011paper06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07118S","chronDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093763","isNumber":"6101292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093763","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6101292","articleId":"6101300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101302,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Bertrand","affiliation":["Department ESAT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Bertrand","id":"37624391700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1289-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1288-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1287-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0854"}],"articleNumber":"6101302","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1787},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Signal processing algorithms","Wireless communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Microphone arrays","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphone arrays","signal processing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless acoustic sensor networks","signal processing","wireless microphone networks","audio acquisition","microphone arrays","network layer design","application layer"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications and trends in wireless acoustic sensor networks: A signal processing perspective","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101292","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093763/6101292/06101302.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101302","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101302","abstract":"Wireless microphone networks or so-called wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) are a next-generation technology for audio acquisition and processing. As opposed to traditional microphone arrays that sample a sound field only locally, often at large distances from the relevant sound sources, WASNs allow to use many more microphones to cover a large area of interest. However, the design of such WASNs is very challenging, especially for real-time audio acquisition and signal enhancement due to the significant data traffic in the network. There is a need for scalable solutions, both on the signal processing level and on the network-communication level. In this paper, we give an overview of applications and trends in the field of WASNs, and we address the core challenges that need to be tackled. We mainly focus on the signal processing level, and we explain how advances in the area of signal processing can relax the high-demanding constraints on the network layer design. Furthermore, we address the interaction between the application layer and the network layer, and we explain why cross-layer design can be important to improve the performance of WASN applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12441238","htmlLink":"/document/6101302/","conferenceDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Applications and trends in wireless acoustic sensor networks: A signal processing perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications and trends in wireless acoustic sensor networks: A signal processing perspective","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"scvt2011paper08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060175S","chronDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093763","isNumber":"6101292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093763","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6101292","articleId":"6101302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6101303,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.C.

This problem can be mitigated by antenna subset selection at the transmitter/receiver. With antenna selection, a small number of analog radio frequency chains are multiplexed between a much larger number of transmit/receive antenna elements. In this paper, we present a low complexity approach to receive antenna selection for capacity maximization, based on the theory of convex optimization. By relaxing the antenna selection variables from discrete to continuous, we arrive at a convex optimization problem. We show via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations that the proposed algorithm provides performance very close to that of optimal selection based on exhaustive search. We consecutively optimize not only the selection of the best antennas but also the angular orientation of individual antenna elements in the array for a so-called true polarization diversity system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093763/6101292/06101309.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna selection in polarization diverse MIMO transmissions with convex optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Correlation","MIMO","Arrays","Antenna arrays","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization diverse MIMO transmissions","antenna subset selection","convex optimization","multiple input multiple output systems","multiple analog transmit/receive chains","analog radio frequency chains","transmit/receive antenna elements","capacity maximization","Monte-Carlo simulations","angular orientation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna Selection","True polarization diversity","spatial correlation","angular correlation","convex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Antenna selection in polarization diverse MIMO transmissions with convex optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101309/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441245","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna selection in polarization diverse MIMO transmissions with convex optimization","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"scvt2011poster04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064139S","chronDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093763","isNumber":"6101292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093763","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6101292","articleId":"6101309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101310,"authors":[{"name":"Paschalis Tsiaflakis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT-SCD), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Paschalis","lastName":"Tsiaflakis","id":"37298923300"},{"name":"Rodrigo B.

(BS) and at the core network side. Currently, large (macro) base stations can satisfy the user requirements; however the trend of deploying heterogeneous networks with both large and small base stations will be required to cover the user throughput demands. This will increase the already large contribution of mobile networks to global energy consumption. Traditionally, energy efficiency (EE) techniques have been proposed at the BS to reduce the energy consumption during downlink (DL) data transmission and idle periods. Nevertheless, during uplink transmissions, the random access procedure plays an important role for energy consumption since it has be to executed continuously, also when little data is being transmitted in the cell. The objective of this paper is to explore the energy consumption of the random access detector and to evaluate some techniques to improve its EE in a software defined radio (SDR). We show that through the use of a single antenna chain, and the generation of the random access preambles from one root sequence, we can decrease the energy consumption depending on the SNR at the detector by 82% without degrading the probability of detecting all the users. Part of this work is done for the Energy Aware Radio and network technologies (EARTH) project.","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101311","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093763/6101292/06101311.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient PRACH detector algorithm in SDR for LTE femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101311/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient PRACH detector algorithm in SDR for LTE femtocells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441247","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101311/","conferenceDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient PRACH detector algorithm in SDR for LTE femtocells","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"scvt2011poster06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094399S","chronDate":"22-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093763","isNumber":"6101292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093763","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6101292","articleId":"6101311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6101313,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Internet Based Communication Networks and Services (IBCN), Ghent University IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"lastName":"Wei Liu","id":"38240010100"},{"name":"Opher Yaron","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Internet Based Communication Networks and Services (IBCN), Ghent University IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Opher","lastName":"Yaron","id":"37377590500"},{"name":"Ingrid Moerman","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Internet Based Communication Networks and Services (IBCN), Ghent University IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Moerman","id":"37279095800"},{"name":"Stefan Bouckaert","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Internet Based Communication Networks and Services (IBCN), Ghent University IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Bouckaert","id":"37395251600"},{"name":"Bart Jooris","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Internet Based Communication Networks and Services (IBCN), Ghent University IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Jooris","id":"37939150300"},{"name":"Piet Demeester","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Internet Based Communication Networks and Services (IBCN), Ghent University IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Piet","lastName":"Demeester","id":"37279152800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1289-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1288-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1287-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0854"}],"articleNumber":"6101313","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":547},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Noise","Bandwidth","Software","OFDM","Time frequency analysis","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum allocation","SDR","universal software-defined radio peripheral","USRP","real-time wide-band-capable spectrum sensing solution","energy detection"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio has received considerable amount of attention as a promising technique to provide dynamic spectrum allocation.

However, the increased luminance resolution comes at price of chrominance distortion. A major challenge is to suppress color fringing artifacts while maintaining sharpness. We propose a new subpixel-based down-sampling pattern called diagonal direct subpixel-based down-sampling (DDSD) for which we design a 2-D image reconstruction model. Then, we formulate subpixel-based down-sampling as a MMSE problem and derive the optimal solution called minimum mean square error for subpixel-based down-sampling (MMSE-SD). Unfortunately, straightforward implementation of MMSE-SD is computational intensive. We thus prove that the solution is equivalent to a 2-D linear filter followed by DDSD, which is much simpler. We further reduce computational complexity using a small \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n \u00d7 \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n filter to approximate the much larger MMSE-SD filter.

Coseismic interferograms have provided, in many cases, \u201cimages of earthquakes,\u201d showing the surface displacement due to the deep fault dislocation. Aside from being visually appealing, such interferograms are of fundamental importance for the analysis, by means of appropriate dislocation models, of the geometrical and kinematic characteristics of the fault, which are also parameters of key interest for earthquake risk management. This paper provides a contribution in the general framework of the integration of dislocation models in DInSAR processing. In particular, with reference to coseismic interferograms, it proposes a technique that allows the direct inversion of wrapped interferograms for dislocation model analysis. This option makes it possible to avoid the critical and error-prone processing step of phase unwrapping, carried out in the classical analysis of interferometric data. Examples of inversion of real data, relevant to the 1999 Athens and Izmit earthquakes, demonstrate the feasibility and the advantages of this data processing approach.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2173584","startPage":"2175","endPage":"2184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6200913/06101567.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2173584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inversion of Wrapped Differential Interferometric SAR Data for Fault Dislocation Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Interferometry","Earthquakes","Vectors","Deformable models","Mathematical model","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earthquake engineering","geophysical image processing","radar interferometry","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wrapped differential interferometric SAR data","differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry","DInSAR technique","remote sensing","geophysical disciplines","surface displacement","deep fault dislocation modeling","fault kinematic characteristics","fault geometrical characteristics","coseismic interferograms","wrapped interferograms inversion","error-prone processing step","phase unwrapping","real data inversion","Athens earthquake risk management","Izmit earthquake image","data processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR)","dislocation modeling","earthquake","singular value decomposition (SVD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101567/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Inversion of Wrapped Differential Interferometric SAR Data for Fault Dislocation Modeling","volume":"50","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6101567/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12728362","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inversion of Wrapped Differential Interferometric SAR Data for Fault Dislocation Modeling","sourcePdf":"tgrs-fornaro-2173584-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081467S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6200913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6200913","articleId":"6101567","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6101573,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Du","affiliation":["NSF FREEDM Systems Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering North Carolina, State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6230687/6101573/6101573-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Du (S'10) was born in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

However, the conventional single angle phase-shift modulation that works well in the forward mode cannot reverse the power flow. In this paper, we propose a modulation strategy for reverse-mode operation by utilizing three phase-shift angles afforded by the two active full bridges of the circuit. We identify the optimal modulation trajectories in 3-D modulation space and implement a lookup-table-based modulator for power flow control. A high-fidelity simulation model of a 35-kW 750-V input, 300-600-V output, and 50-kHz insulated-gate bipolar-transistor-based converter was used for verification. The proposed modulation scheme and efficiency calculations were validated on a scaled-down (15-kW) prototype. The power loss distribution was analyzed for further converter efficiency optimization.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2175669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2175669","startPage":"4617","endPage":"4628","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6230687/06101573.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6230687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation Technique to Reverse Power Flow for the Isolated Series Resonant DC\u2013DC Converter With Clamped Capacitor Voltage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Modulation Technique to Reverse Power Flow for the Isolated Series Resonant DC\u2013DC Converter With Clamped Capacitor Voltage","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2012","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101573/","accessionNumber":"12834256","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101573/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation Technique to Reverse Power Flow for the Isolated Series Resonant DC\u2013DC Converter With Clamped Capacitor Voltage","sourcePdf":"tie-du-2175669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087242S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6230687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6230687","articleId":"6101573","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6101578,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Mike Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Jacobs School of Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6171062/6101578/6101578-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Mike Chi (S'96\u2013M'00) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, in 2011.","He is currently the Chief Technology Officer at Cognionics, Inc., working on wireless and noncontact biopotential sensing systems."]},"firstName":"Yu Mike","lastName":"Chi","id":"37535726100"},{"name":"Yu-Te Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering in Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6171062/6101578/6101578-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Te Wang received the M.S. degree from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2009.

This study compares wet electrodes to dry and through hair, noncontact electrodes within a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI paradigm. The construction of a dry contact electrode, featuring fingered contact posts and active buffering circuitry is presented. Additionally, the development of a new, noncontact, capacitive electrode that utilizes a custom integrated, high-impedance analog front-end is introduced. Offline tests on 10 subjects characterize the signal quality from the different electrodes and demonstrate that acquisition of small amplitude, SSVEP signals is possible, even through hair using the new integrated noncontact sensor. Online BCI experiments demonstrate that the information transfer rate (ITR) with the dry electrodes is comparable to that of wet electrodes, completely without the need for gel or other conductive media. In addition, data from the noncontact electrode, operating on the top of hair, show a maximum ITR in excess of 19 bits/min at 100% accuracy (versus 29.2 bits/min for wet electrodes and 34.4 bits/min for dry electrodes), a level that has never been demonstrated before. The results of these experiments show that both dry and noncontact electrodes, with further development, may become a viable tool for both future mobile BCI and general EEG applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dry and Noncontact EEG Sensors for Mobile Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2174652","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/6171062/06101578.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2174652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6171062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101578/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Dry and Noncontact EEG Sensors for Mobile Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6101578/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12615336","pubMedId":"22180514","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dry and Noncontact EEG Sensors for Mobile Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tnsre-chi-2174652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147919S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6171062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"6171062","articleId":"6101578","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6101584,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen L.

The environment is modeled as a field that is defined over a finite set of locations. The field grows linearly at locations that are not within the range of a robot and decreases linearly at locations that are within range of a robot. We assume that the robots travel on given closed paths. The speed of each robot along its path is controlled to prevent the field from growing unbounded at any location. We consider the space of speed controllers that are parametrized by a finite set of basis functions. For a single robot, we develop a linear program that computes a speed controller in this space to keep the field bounded, if such a controller exists. Another linear program is derived to compute the speed controller that minimizes the maximum field value over the environment. We extend our linear program formulation to develop a multirobot controller that keeps the field bounded. We characterize, both theoretically and in simulation, the robustness of the controllers to modeling errors and to stochasticity in the environment.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2174493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6177749/06101584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2174493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177749","startPage":"410","endPage":"426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Persistent Robotic Tasks: Monitoring and Sweeping in Changing Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Persistent Robotic Tasks: Monitoring and Sweeping in Changing Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638973","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6101584/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Persistent Robotic Tasks: Monitoring and Sweeping in Changing Environments","sourcePdf":"tro-smith-2174493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107572S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6177749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"6177749","articleId":"6101584","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6101586,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk Smeets","affiliation":["Medical Image Computing (ESAT/PSI), Faculty of Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/6269137/6101586/6101586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dirk Smeets received the graduate degree and the master's degree in mechanical-electrical engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in June 2008.

While many survey papers on face recognition exist, in this paper, we focus on a comparative study of 3-D face recognition under expression variations. As a first contribution, 3-D face databases with expressions are listed, and the most important ones are briefly presented and their complexity is quantified using the iterative closest point (ICP) baseline recognition algorithm. This allows to rank the databases according to their inherent difficulty for face-recognition tasks. This analysis reveals that the FRGC v2 database can be considered as the most challenging because of its size, the presence of expressions and outliers, and the time lapse between the recordings. Therefore, we recommend to use this database as a reference database to evaluate (expression-invariant) 3-D face-recognition algorithms. We also determine and quantify the most important factors that influence the performance. It appears that performance decreases 1) with the degree of nonfrontal pose, 2) for certain expression types, 3) with the magnitude of the expressions, 4) with an increasing number of expressions, and 5) for a higher number of gallery subjects. Future 3-D face-recognition algorithms should be evaluated on the basis of all these factors. As the second contribution, a survey of published 3-D face-recognition methods that deal with expression variations is given. These methods are subdivided into three classes depending on the way the expressions are handled. Region-based methods use expression-stable regions only, while other methods model the expressions either using an isometric or a statistical model. Isometric models assume the deformation because of expression variation to be (locally) isometric, meaning that the deformation preserves lengths along the surface. Statistical models learn how the facial soft tissue deforms during expressions based on a training database with expression labels. Algorithmic performances are evaluated by the comparison of recognition rates for identification and verification. No statistical significant differences in class performance are found between any pair of classes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study of 3-D Face Recognition Under Expression Variations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2174221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/6269137/06101586.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2174221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study of 3-D Face Recognition Under Expression Variations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6101586/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12921112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study of 3-D Face Recognition Under Expression Variations","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-smeets-2174221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.21814S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"6269137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6269137","articleId":"6101586","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6101588,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Hui Tan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6101588/6101588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Hui Tan (S'00-M'05) received the M.

Each link employs an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where modulated symbols are drawn from a finite constellation set. We first obtain the diversity order of the CMAC, as a function of the time sharing variables of the users and the rates of the codes. To achieve this rate-diversity tradeoff, we use the principle of network coding where messages of the two sources are jointly encoded. Both separate and joint network-channel coding approaches are considered. Specifically, we design multiple turbo codes that minimize the outage probabilities of these approaches. We also give a code structure for the multiple turbo codes to achieve full diversity of the system. The codes are optimized using the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis with iterative decoding tailored for OFDM modulated CMAC. Numerical examples show that with our proposed design technique, the achieved frame error rate is within 0.5dB from the information outage. Without network-channel coding, the outage probability of distributed coding cannot achieve the diversity order given in the rate-diversity tradeoff.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06101588.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.101491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.101491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Modulated Cooperative Multiple-Access Channel with Network-Channel Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Joints","Turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cooperative communication","diversity reception","fading channels","iterative decoding","network coding","OFDM modulation","optimisation","probability","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","cooperative multiple access channel","network channel coding","frequency selective block fading","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","finite constellation set","diversity reception","CMAC","turbo codes","extrinsic information transfer","optimization","EXIT chart analysis","iterative decoding","frame error rate","outage probability","distributed coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-channel coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Modulated Cooperative Multiple-Access Channel with Network-Channel Coding","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6101588/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537053","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Modulated Cooperative Multiple-Access Channel with Network-Channel Coding","sourcePdf":"604-tw1202-tan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095604S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6101588","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101589,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Gestner","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6135125/6101589/6101589-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brian Gestner (S'05) earned his B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA in 2004.

Lattice-reduction-aided detectors are attractive solutions to this problem because these detectors achieve the same diversity as the maximum-likelihood detector while exhibiting lower complexity. Current applications of lattice-reduction-aided detectors involve executing a lattice reduction algorithm to completion and then utilizing this result in the subsequent symbol detection. In this article, however, we examine the possibility of partially executing the lattice reduction algorithm. We first demonstrate using a hypothetical lattice-reduction-aided detector that early termination of lattice reduction algorithms is possible in the context of MIMO detection. Encouraged by these results, we develop and introduce incremental lattice reduction, which utilizes a practical early termination condition. We then apply this idea to develop a joint symbol detection and lattice reduction algorithm that is based on the Lenstra, Lenstra, Lovasz algorithm and successive interference cancellation. An evaluation using a spatial correlation channel model demonstrates that the proposed algorithm effectively distributes the lattice reduction processing over the length of each received packet. This behavior naturally enables the relaxation of throughput and latency requirements of lattice reduction algorithm hardware realizations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101589/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12487483","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6101589/","publicationDate":"January 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incremental Lattice Reduction: Motivation, Theory, and Practical Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Lattice Reduction: Motivation, Theory, and Practical Implementation","sourcePdf":"188-tw1201-gestner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077884S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6101589","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6101591,"authors":[{"name":"Ramin Vali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6101591/6101591-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ramin Vali received the BE degree (honours) from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\u2019 The University of Auckland, New Zealand in 2007.

When the secondary users have enough antennas, we derive several secondary user precoders that approximately maximize the secondary users' sum rate without changing the sum rate of the active users. When the secondary users do not have enough antennas, we perform numerical optimization to find secondary user precoders that cause minimum degradation to the sum rate of the active users. Through simulations, we confirm that i) with enough antennas at the secondary users, gains equivalent to the case of all the users cooperating through interference alignment is obtainable, and ii) when the secondary users do not have enough antennas, large rate losses at the active users can be avoided.channels","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.111088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06101593.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.111088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Arrival in MIMO Interference Alignment Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101593/","displayDocTitle":"User Arrival in MIMO Interference Alignment Networks","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537056","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101593/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Arrival in MIMO Interference Alignment Networks","sourcePdf":"842-tw1202-makouei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130356S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6101593","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101595,"authors":[{"name":"Gayan Amarasuriya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Gayan","lastName":"Amarasuriya","id":"37394070900"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"},{"name":"Masoud Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Ardakani","id":"37272335000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6101595","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1667},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Joints","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","error statistics","MIMO communication","probability","receiving antennas","relays","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint relay strategy","antenna selection strategy","dual-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relay network","dual-hop amplify-and-forward multiple-input multiple- output relay network","channel state information","channel-assisted AF","fixed-gain AF","best single transmit antenna","transmit-receive antenna pair","relay-to-destination channel","source-to-relay channel","partial selection strategy","asymptotic outage probability","exact outage probability","asymptotic average symbol error rate","diversity order","array gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay networks","MIMO","antenna and relay selection"]}],"abstract":"Four joint relay and antenna selection strategies for dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-output relay networks are studied.

However, the inter- and intra-tier interferences in such systems can significantly reduce the capacity and cause an unacceptably high level of outage. This paper treats the uplink interference problem in orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)-based femtocell networks with partial cochannel deployment. We first propose an inter-tier interference mitigation strategy without the femtocell users power control by forcing the femto-interfering macrocell users to use only some dedicated subcarriers. The non-interfering macrocell users, on the other hand, can use either the dedicated subcarriers, or the shared subcarriers which are also used by the femtocell users. We then propose subcarrier allocation schemes based on the auction algorithm for macrocell users and femtocell users, respectively, to independently mitigate the intra-tier interference. The proposed interference mitigation scheme for femtocell networks offers significant performance improvement over the existing methods by substantially reducing the inter- and intra-tier inferences in the system.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.101794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06101596.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.101794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Interference Mitigation for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101596/","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Interference Mitigation for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537059","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101596/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Interference Mitigation for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"614-tw1202-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104838S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6101596","onlineDate":"12 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101597,"authors":[{"name":"Minyan Pei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, China"],"firstName":"Minyan","lastName":"Pei","id":"38232572500"},{"name":"Jibo Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jibo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279094700"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407492500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6101597","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1756},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Downlink","Noise","Robustness","MIMO","Vectors","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["masked beamforming","multiuser MIMO wiretap channels","imperfect channel state information","eavesdropper","base station","artificial noise","minimum mean square error constraints","MSE uplink-downlink duality","user links"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial noise","imperfect CSI","MIMO broadcast channels","MSE duality","Security"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates masked beamforming schemes for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink systems in the presence of an eavesdropper.

The results of the present investigations carried out both on the optical and wireless sections offer proper overall performance for different applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband OFDM signal transmission over combined optical-wireless links","publicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101680","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088932/6101646/06101680.pdf","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Broadband OFDM signal transmission over combined optical-wireless links","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101680/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12486139","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband OFDM signal transmission over combined optical-wireless links","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060465S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088932","isNumber":"6101646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088932","xplore-issue":"6101646","articleId":"6101680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6101703,"authors":[{"name":"Ryosuke Suga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryosuke","lastName":"Suga","id":"37545544600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Nakano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37291059700"},{"name":"Yasutake Hirachi","affiliation":["AMMSystem, Inc., Ota, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasutake","lastName":"Hirachi","id":"37299438400"},{"name":"Jiro Hirokawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jiro","lastName":"Hirokawa","id":"37280655700"},{"name":"Makoto Ando","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Ando","id":"37280656900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-022-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-235-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6101703","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Slabs","Gain","Wires","Antenna radiation patterns","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave antennas","personal area networks","surface mount technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave antenna","slab waveguide","WPAN applications","high isolation characteristics","wireless file transfer system","surface mount package","fabricated antenna","antenna isolation characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna-package","antenna isolation","lateral radiation","slab waveguide"]}],"abstract":"A small antenna with high isolation characteristics is designed and evaluated.

The working principle is based on detuning of a complementary split ring resonator by a controlled change of its coupling capacitance. The fully planar build-up and the opportunity of the utilization of ceramic substrates allow an application at very high temperatures. Besides high temperature, the sensor principle shows an inherent robustness against other disturbances in harsh environments, e.g. high electric or magnetic field strength. Additional identification capabilities allow to distinguish between different sensors. By the utilization of a polarization decoupling scheme, an improved separation between response signal of the sensor and various interferences is achieved. A prototype, measuring a two-dimensional displacement in the range of some millimeters, was built to approve the theoretical considerations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101801","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101801","startPage":"79","endPage":"82","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088932/6101646/06101801.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","publicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101801/","displayDocTitle":"Passive chipless wireless sensor for two-dimensional displacement measurement","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12486252","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6101801/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive chipless wireless sensor for two-dimensional displacement measurement","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053221S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088932","isNumber":"6101646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088932","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6101646","articleId":"6101801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6101808,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Asada","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Asada","id":"37856980600"},{"name":"Kota Matsushita","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kota","lastName":"Matsushita","id":"37853002900"},{"name":"Keigo Bunsen","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keigo","lastName":"Bunsen","id":"37594569500"},{"name":"Kenichi Okada","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Okada","id":"37280639100"},{"name":"Akira Matsuzawa","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Matsuzawa","id":"37328684600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-022-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-235-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6101808","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1729},"abstract":"This paper presents a 60GHz power amplifier using a capacitive cross-coupling neutralization.

In comparison to the classical inverse class-F mode, this approach provides a much wider design space for the realization of broadband power amplifiers, where output performance can be maintained through the proper termination of harmonic current components over bandwidth. By varying simultaneously the susceptance of fundamental and second harmonic terminations, it will be shown how drain efficiency and output power can be maintained at constant high levels over significant bandwidth. For the validation of this new theory, measurements have been carried out on GaAs pHEMT transistor at 0.9GHz and at a drain voltage of 4V.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101840","publicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088932/6101646/06101840.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"336","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the design space for broadband pas using the novel \u201ccontinuous inverse class-F mode\u201d","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the design space for broadband pas using the novel \u201ccontinuous inverse class-F mode\u201d","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6101840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440698","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101840/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the design space for broadband pas using the novel \u201ccontinuous inverse class-F mode\u201d","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054225S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088932","isNumber":"6101646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088932","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6101646","articleId":"6101840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6101860,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmioud Abdelrahman Abdalla","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, MTC College, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mahmioud Abdelrahman","lastName":"Abdalla","id":"37291578800"},{"name":"Zhirun Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Zhirun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37281086600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-022-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-235-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6101860","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":665},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circulators","Coplanar waveguides","Ferrites","Power dividers","Bandwidth","Microwave circuits","Saturation magnetization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coplanar waveguides","coupled transmission lines","ferrite circulators","power combiners","power dividers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CPW ferrite coupled line circulator","left-handed power divider-combiner","three-port coplanar waveguide","FCL circulator","left handed T junction","DC magnetic bias","power circulation","insertion loss","return loss","bandwidth 8 GHz to 12 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microwave devices","circulator","ferrite coupled line","metamaterials","left handed"]}],"abstract":"A novel three-port coplanar waveguide (CPW) ferrite coupled line (FCL) circulator is presented for the first time.

Also, left-handed T junction power divider/combiner has the advantages of its broadband and compact size (50% size reduction at the mid frequency compared to conventional T junction) at the same time.

Liquid metal is used to dynamically alter the number of antenna elements activated along a linear array configuration with respect to temperature. In this way, the sensed temperature value can be accurately quantified by the change in radar cross section (RCS) of the device. Simulation and measurements of the backscattered power of the temperature-reconfigurable array were performed to verify the concept and benchmark the sensitivity and temperature range of the sensor. This study is based on the number of elements activated by the short-circuiting of their gap through the temperature-expansion of liquid metal inside a bridging microfluidic channel. For the first time the remote measurement of temperature based on the RCS variability of a microfluidics-realized sensor is presented. It features an RCS range of 9 dBsm at 29.5 GHz corresponding to a tunable temperature range of at least 20\u00b0K and a resolution of 1.8 dBsm per element activated resulting in a temperature resolution around 4\u00b0K. It has to be noted that numerous major challenges encountered in the feeding and encapsulation of liquid metal inside microfluidic channels were addressed and preliminary guidelines for a novel generation of wireless sensors based on liquid metal and microfluidic technologies have been established for the first time.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101891","publicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088932/6101646/06101891.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wireless passive RCS-based temperature sensor using liquid metal and microfluidics technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A wireless passive RCS-based temperature sensor using liquid metal and microfluidics technologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440740","htmlLink":"/document/6101891/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wireless passive RCS-based temperature sensor using liquid metal and microfluidics technologies","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056148S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088932","isNumber":"6101646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088932","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6101646","articleId":"6101891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6101895,"authors":[{"name":"Lamine Abdelghani","affiliation":["INRS, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Lamine","lastName":"Abdelghani","id":"38233219900"},{"name":"Tayeb A.

The Mode-Matching technique, in combination with global search algorithms, is used for the full-wave analysis and optimization of the polarizers. In the first polarizer, the height of the corrugations is designed according to a taper-type shape.

Conventional polarimetric radiometer systems generally consist of a phase discriminator composed of couplers, crossovers and external loads. A six-port is proposed for the first time to replace this discriminator. This approach presents advantages such as lower cost and smaller size. Furthermore, the use of SIW technology allows integrability, compactness and low interference susceptibility. Simulation and measurement results show that the proposed six-port can operate over 20% of bandwidth centered at 34 GHz. To the knowledge of the authors, the achieved bandwidth is higher than other SIW six-ports reported in the literature. To validate the proposed application, the six-port is integrated in a front-end receiver. Measurements show achieved polarimetric channel symmetry of 1 dB and isolation of 29 dB which presents excellent performances. This six-port architecture presents advantages for implementation in passive millimeter-wave remote sensing systems.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101963","publicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088932/6101646/06101963.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband substrate-integrated-waveguide six-port applied to the development of polarimetric imaging radiometer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101963/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband substrate-integrated-waveguide six-port applied to the development of polarimetric imaging radiometer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440801","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101963/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband substrate-integrated-waveguide six-port applied to the development of polarimetric imaging radiometer","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117666S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088932","isNumber":"6101646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088932","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6101646","articleId":"6101963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6101967,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Kowlgi","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, France","Institut Telecom (ENST), Paris, France"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Kowlgi","id":"38233371400"},{"name":"Corinne Berland","affiliation":["LaMIPS (Caen), ESIEE, CRISMAT, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Corinne","lastName":"Berland","id":"37277516500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-022-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-235-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6101967","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["GSM","Linearity","Peak to average power ratio","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearity consideration","multistandard cellular base station transmitter","contemporary cellular base station","simultaneous cellular signal transmission","transceiver","multimode transmission","transmitter nonlinearity requirement","OIP3","multistandard base station","multicarrier base station","macrocell base station","first-order approximation","dynamic range issue"]}],"abstract":"Contemporary cellular base stations are becoming increasingly multi-standard for improved efficiency and manageability. Primary among prospective multi-standard base station deployments will be those that are reconfigurable but also capable of simultaneous transmission of several cellular signals. The simultaneous transmission of multiple cellular signals however poses a challenge for design, in particular the linearity requirements of the transceiver. In order to identify the feasibility of multi-mode transmission, we present an overview of transmitter non-linearity (OIP3) requirements for future multi-standard, multi-carrier, macro-cell base stations based on first-order approximations, highlighting the dynamic range issue. Simulation and measurement results are also presented.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101967","publicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 41st European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6088932/6101646/06101967.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearity considerations for multi-standard cellular base station transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6101967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6101967/","displayDocTitle":"Linearity considerations for multi-standard cellular base station transmitters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440805","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6101967/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearity considerations for multi-standard cellular base station transmitters","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122885S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6088932","isNumber":"6101646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088932","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6101646","articleId":"6101967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6101984,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Mirzaei","affiliation":["Edward S.

In spite of significant development of new technologies during the last decade, commercial below-knee and above-knee prostheses are still energetically passive devices. However, many locomotive functions, like walking up stairs and slopes, need significant power in knee and ankle joints. The additional power for doing previously mentioned activities needs to be achieved by means of external energy sources, which should be integral prosthetic components. This paper presents preliminary investigations towards an active robotic prosthesis that could potentially enable people with an above- or below-knee amputation to perform different types of motions that require power in lower limb joints. Our initial prototype, SmartLeg, integrates advanced prosthetic and robotic technology with the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms capable of adapting the working of the prosthesis to the optimal gait and power consumption patterns, and which therefore provide means to customize the device to a particular user.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2011.6102090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2011.6102090","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 XXIII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093619/6102075/06102090.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 XXIII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SmartLeg: An intelligent active robotic prosthesis for lower-limb amputees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SmartLeg: An intelligent active robotic prosthesis for lower-limb amputees","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102090/","accessionNumber":"12440958","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102090/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SmartLeg: An intelligent active robotic prosthesis for lower-limb amputees","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"d01p08id192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046837S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093619","isNumber":"6102075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093619","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6102075","articleId":"6102090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6102093,"authors":[{"name":"Asmir Voden\u010darevi\u0107","affiliation":["Knowledge-Based Systems Research Group, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Asmir","lastName":"Voden\u010darevi\u0107","id":"38229056900"},{"name":"Hans Kleine B\u00fcning","affiliation":["Knowledge-Based Systems Research Group, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans Kleine","lastName":"B\u00fcning","id":"37564817400"},{"name":"Oliver Niggemann","affiliation":["InIT-Institut Industrial IT, Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Niggemann","id":"37541180300"},{"name":"Alexander Maier","affiliation":["InIT-Institut Industrial IT, Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Maier","id":"38230480400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0746-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0744-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0745-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102093","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning automata","Timing","Mathematical model","Automata","Heuristic algorithms","Sensors","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automata theory","manufacturing systems","reliability","safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavior model","anomaly detection technique","hybrid system","anomaly diagnosis technique","hybrid automaton framework","running production system","hybrid system safety","hybrid system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid system","behavior model","anomaly detection","learning hybrid automata"]}],"abstract":"The importance of safety and reliability in today's real-world complex hybrid systems, such as process plants, led to the development of various anomaly detection and diagnosis techniques.

Manual modeling requires a lot of efforts and resources. This paper gives a procedure for anomaly detection in hybrid systems that uses automatically generated behavior models. The model is learned from logged system's measurements in a hybrid automaton framework. The presented anomaly detection algorithm utilizes the model to predict the system behavior, and to compare it with the observed behavior in an online manner. Alarms are raised whenever a discrepancy is found between these two. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in detecting several types of anomalies in a real-world running production system.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2011.6102093","publicationTitle":"2011 XXIII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 XXIII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093619/6102075/06102093.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2011.6102093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using behavior models for anomaly detection in hybrid systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102093/","displayDocTitle":"Using behavior models for anomaly detection in hybrid systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440961","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102093/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using behavior models for anomaly detection in hybrid systems","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"d01p11id073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074336S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093619","isNumber":"6102075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093619","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6102075","articleId":"6102093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6102108,"authors":[{"name":"Suvad Selman","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, International University of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Suvad","lastName":"Selman","id":"38132062200"},{"name":"Alma Husagic-Selman","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, International University of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Alma","lastName":"Husagic-Selman","id":"38357436200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0746-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0744-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0745-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102108","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Testing","Multilayer perceptrons","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayered feedforward neural network","complex input-output mapping","textual descriptor","computational complexity","author identification","machine learning","classification problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","author identification","artificial neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102108","abstract":"This paper proposes a means of using a multilayered feedforward neural network to identify the author of a text.

These harmonics produce additional loses at both windings and the core of a PMSM and increase the temperature inside the machine. Such a temperature increase affects the machine parameters and the efficiency. Therefore, in order to obtain the optimum operating conditions of a PMSM, current harmonics should be analyzed. In the present study, two types of rotors for a PMSM have been simulated and evaluated with a current controlled voltage source inverter (VSI) by the help of a 3D finite element method. As a result of these simulations, motor current harmonics are examined by using the Hamming method at different modulation frequencies and the outputs of efficiencies, torques, powers and the induced voltages on windings are compared for these shaft structures. It has been proven that the current ripples and harmonics may be decreased to some extend by using a symmetrical structure among the proposed structures.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2011.6102131","publicationTitle":"2011 XXIII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 XXIII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093619/6102075/06102131.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2011.6102131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of current harmonics using FEM on different rotor types of PMSMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102131/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of current harmonics using FEM on different rotor types of PMSMs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440999","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102131/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of current harmonics using FEM on different rotor types of PMSMs","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"d03p49id149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082903S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093619","isNumber":"6102075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093619","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6102075","articleId":"6102131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6102167,"authors":[{"name":"Koji Matsuura","affiliation":["Research Core for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Matsuura","id":"37587288800"},{"name":"Koyo Watanabe","affiliation":["Research Core for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan"],"firstName":"Koyo","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37074402900"},{"name":"Mieko Kodama","affiliation":["Research Core for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan"],"firstName":"Mieko","lastName":"Kodama","id":"38242662400"},{"name":"Yuka Kuroda","affiliation":["Research Core for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuka","lastName":"Kuroda","id":"37596064100"},{"name":"Keiji Naruse","affiliation":["Cardiovascular Physiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Naruse","id":"37295320800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1362-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1360-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1361-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102167","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embryo","Fluorescence","Microfluidics","Mice","Microscopy","Calcium","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","biochemistry","biological techniques","biomechanics","biomembranes","calcium","cellular biophysics","fluorescence","high-speed optical techniques","internal stresses","optical microscopy","shear deformation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["observation system development","intracellular calcium concentration","mechanical stimuli","mammalian embryos","air-actuating device","cellular response","mouse blastocysts","time-resolved confocal microscopy imaging","polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channels","deforming membrane","shear stress","embryo stress","compressive force","blastocyst shape","force deformation curve","confocal fluorescence microscopy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102167","abstract":"Using an air-actuating device, we investigated the cellular response to mechanical stimuli (MS) in mouse blastocysts.

Based on the bio-nano manipulation system, we propose a nano-injection method by fluorescent nanoprobe insertion. The fluorescent nanoprobe is needed to observe nanoprobe by OM. The nanoprobe is designed to have a sharp tip to insert the probe into biological specimen. It is fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) process. The nano-scale size is important for minimal damage to biological specimen. The Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is used as a target biological specimen, which is one of the important model organism for diseases analysis. The nanoinjection technique is needed to transport fluorescent materials or specific biological organism into specific cell for in-vivo experiment. The proposed system is considered to be important as future nano-surgery system for life innovation using model organism.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective nano-injection using nano-probe based on Nanomanipulation under hybrid microscope","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science","doi":"10.1109/MHS.2011.6102181","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093626/6102137/06102181.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MHS.2011.6102181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102137","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Selective nano-injection using nano-probe based on Nanomanipulation under hybrid microscope","conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102181/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441160","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective nano-injection using nano-probe based on Nanomanipulation under hybrid microscope","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"07P211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079303S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093626","isNumber":"6102137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093626","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6102137","articleId":"6102181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6102198,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Tercero","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano Systems Engineering, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Tercero","id":"37295974700"},{"name":"Seiichi Ikeda","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano Systems Engineering, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37269085900"},{"name":"Toshio Fukuda","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano Systems Engineering, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37279174500"},{"name":"Fumihito Arai","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumihito","lastName":"Arai","id":"37274069600"},{"name":"Makoto Negoro","affiliation":["Department of Neurosurgery, Fujita Health University, Kutsukake-cho, Toyoake, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Negoro","id":"37282429100"},{"name":"Ikuo Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Neurosurgery, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Ikuo","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37326923000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1362-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1360-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1361-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102198","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"Simulator based evaluation has been used for medical licensing, intravascular tools evaluation and robotic catheter insertion systems research.

The influence of algorithm parameters on system behavior is investigated and the various advantages and drawbacks of each technique are identified for different weather conditions.

The active and reactive power injections from DG units, typically installed close to the load centers, are seen as a cost-effective solution for distribution system voltage support, energy saving, and reliability improvement. This paper proposes a novel distribution system expansion planning strategy encompassing renewable DG systems with schedulable and intermittent power generation patterns. The reactive capability limits of different renewable DG systems covering wind, solar photovoltaic, and biomass-based generation units are included in the planning model and the system uncertainties such as load demand, wind speed, and solar radiation are also accounted using probabilistic models. The problem of distribution system planning with renewable DG is formulated as constrained mixed integer nonlinear programming, wherein the total cost will be minimized with optimal allocation of various renewable DG systems. A solution algorithm integrating TRIBE particle swarm optimization (TRIBE PSO) and ordinal optimization (OO) is developed to effectively obtain optimal and near-optimal solutions for system planners. TRIBE PSO, OO, and the proposed algorithm are applied to a practical test system and results are compared and presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165391/6102278/06102294.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2011.2166281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2011.2166281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution System Planning With Incorporating DG Reactive Capability and System Uncertainties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Uncertainty","Solar radiation","Wind speed","Reactive power","Biomass","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","energy conservation","integer programming","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation","power distribution planning","power distribution reliability","power generation economics","power generation reliability","power generation scheduling","probability","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution planning","distributed power generation","reactive power","power system uncertainty","active power","energy saving","power distribution reliability","power generation scheduling","renewable DG systems","probabilistic models","mixed integer nonlinear programming","cost minimization","optimal allocation","TRIBE","particle swarm optimization","ordinal optimization","PSO","OO","solar power generation","biomass based generation units","wind power generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization","power distribution planning","reactive power","solar power generation","wind power generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distribution System Planning With Incorporating DG Reactive Capability and System Uncertainties","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6102294/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425195","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution System Planning With Incorporating DG Reactive Capability and System Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tste-zou-2166281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09504S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"6102278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"6102278","articleId":"6102294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6102308,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea M.

One of the key foundations of smart grid is timely access to meter data via reliable communication infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce cognitive radio into home area networks of smart grid, whose framework and result can be trivially extended to neighborhood and wide area networks. By means of spectrum sensing and channel switching techniques, smart meters can decide to transmit meter data either on the original unlicensed channel or the additional licensed channel, in order to improve reliability and timeliness. We find optimal sensing time to reduce packet loss rate and delay, under the constraint that the PU is sufficiently protected. We formulate the sensing-delay tradeoff problem and prove that it has unique optimal sensing time which yields the minimum delay.

The solutions offered thus far have been tied to specific technologies such as batteries or assumptions on data usage. Existing solutions have also not quantified the loss of benefit (utility) that results from any such privacy-preserving approach. Using tools from information theory, a new framework is presented that abstracts both the privacy and the utility requirements of smart meter data. This leads to a novel privacy-utility tradeoff problem with minimal assumptions that is tractable. Specifically for a stationary Gaussian Markov model of the electricity load, it is shown that the optimal utility-and-privacy preserving solution requires filtering out frequency components that are low in power, and this approach appears to encompass most of the proposed privacy approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6102315/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440863","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Smart meter privacy: A utility-privacy framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart meter privacy: A utility-privacy framework","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p190rajagopalan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049717S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":6102319,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tajer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Tajer","id":"38577078800"},{"name":"Soummyar Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Soummyar","lastName":"Kar","id":"37069602000"},{"name":"H.

It is, therefore, of paramount significance not only to detect the attacks, but also to recover the system state from the contaminated observation when an attack is deemed to be present. This paper offers a distributed framework for an optimal such joint attack detection and system recovery. This framework has two main features: 1) it provides the network operator with the freedom of striking any desired balance between attack detection and state recovery accuracies, and 2) it is distributed in the sense that different controlling agents distributed across the network carry out the attack detection and system recovery tasks through iterative local processing and message passing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102319.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"207","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed joint cyber attack detection and state recovery in smart grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","State estimation","Joints","Sensors","Noise","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","message passing","power engineering computing","power system security","smart power grids","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint cyber attack detection","state recovery","smart grids","dynamic state estimation","system operation","malicious cyber attacks","controller observation","false data","contaminated observation","distributed framework","network operator","controlling agent","iterative local processing","message passing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed joint cyber attack detection and state recovery in smart grids","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102319/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440867","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed joint cyber attack detection and state recovery in smart grids","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p202tajer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073893S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6102321,"authors":[{"name":"Zubair A.

With the emergence of this infrastructure and accompanying technologies, the need for securing the same from malicious attempts by the adversary class to disrupt routine operations, cannot be understated. A standard SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), obtained from smart meters. Some of the devices connected to the SGI, such as sensors and actuators, are resource-constrained in nature. In addition, an omnipresent threat to the SGI, from the adversary class in cyberspace, does indeed exist. In this paper, a brief description of various types of malicious attacks against SGI operations, is presented. In addition, a light-weighted pattern matching technique for detecting such attacks, is discussed. The proposed scheme is capable of detecting anomalous device behavior at various levels of the SGI hierarchy, at the same time imposing minimal overhead in terms of communication and storage needed.","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102321","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102321.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of pattern matching for rapid anomaly detection in smart grid infrastructures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Smart grids","Security","Receivers","Servers","Meter reading","Electricity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern matching","power system security","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart grid infrastructures","pattern matching","rapid anomaly detection","electric grid","malicious attacks","disrupt routine operations","disparate devices","heterogeneous devices","customer-specific data","adversary class","cyberspace","SGI hierarchy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the use of pattern matching for rapid anomaly detection in smart grid infrastructures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102321/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440869","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of pattern matching for rapid anomaly detection in smart grid infrastructures","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p214baig.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065975S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6102324,"authors":[{"name":"Annarita Giani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, Univ of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Annarita","lastName":"Giani","id":"37666703700"},{"name":"Eilyan Bitar","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering, Univ of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Eilyan","lastName":"Bitar","id":"37547084200"},{"name":"Manuel Garcia","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering, Univ of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Garcia","id":"38488381300"},{"name":"Miles McQueen","affiliation":["Idaho National Labs."],"firstName":"Miles","lastName":"McQueen","id":"37542676300"},{"name":"Pramod Khargonekar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Univ of Florida, Gainesville"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Khargonekar","id":"37326396500"},{"name":"Kameshwar Poolla","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, Univ of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Kameshwar","lastName":"Poolla","id":"37265691000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1702-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102324","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1934},"abstract":"Coordinated cyberattacks of power meter readings can be arranged to be undetectable by any bad data detection algorithm in the power system state estimation process. These unobservable attacks present a potentially serious threat to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of line power meters is presented. This requires O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nm) flops for a power system with n buses and m line meters. If all lines are metered, there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks. These can be quickly detected in power systems using standard graph algorithms. Known-secure phasor measurement units [PMUs] can be used as countermeasures against an arbitrary collection of cyberattacks. Finding the minimum number of necessary PMUs is NP-hard. It is shown that p + 1 PMUs at carefully chosen buses are sufficient to neutralize a collection of p cyberattacks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102324.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart grid data integrity attacks: characterizations and countermeasures<sup>\u03c0</sup>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phasor measurement units","Power systems","Computer crime","State estimation","Vectors","Energy management","Transmission line measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","computerised instrumentation","graph theory","phasor measurement","power engineering computing","power meters","SCADA systems","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart grid data integrity attack","coordinated cyberattacks","power meter readings","power system state estimation process","sparse attacks","DC load flow","power injection meter","graph algorithm","secure phasor measurement units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart Grid","cybersecurity","synchro-phasors","observability","integrity attacks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Smart grid data integrity attacks: characterizations and countermeasures<sup>\u03c0</sup>","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102324/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440872","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart grid data integrity attacks: characterizations and countermeasures<sup>\u03c0</sup>","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p232giani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114645S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6102326,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Esmalifalak","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Esmalifalak","id":"37546746700"},{"name":"Huy Nguyen","affiliation":["CS Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Huy","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38065106800"},{"name":"Rong Zheng","affiliation":["CS Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37285841600"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Zhu Han","id":"37278605300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1702-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102326","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Topology","Transmission line measurements","State estimation","Smart grids","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","independent component analysis","Jacobian matrices","matrix multiplication","power engineering computing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stealth false data injection","independent component analysis","smart grid","cyber attacks","stealth false data attacks","power grid topology","system dynamics","Jacobian matrix multiplied","eigenvectors","covariance matrix","MATPOWER"]}],"abstract":"In smart grid, the strong coupling between cyber and physical operations makes power systems vulnerable to cyber attacks.

In this paper, the complex decision making processes of a number of PHEV groups seeking to sell part of their stored energy in a power market are studied using noncooperative games and double auctions. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between the PHEV groups. In this game, each PHEV group can make a decision on the maximum amount of energy surplus that it is willing to sell so as to maximize a utility function that captures the tradeoff between the economical benefits from energy trading and the associated costs. The trading price governing the energy exchange market between the PHEVs and the smart grid network is determined using a strategy-proof double auction. For solving the game, an algorithm based on best response dynamics is proposed using which the PHEV groups can reach a Nash equilibrium point. Simulation results show how our approach allows the PHEV groups to act strategically while improving the average utility achieved per PHEV group of up to 100.2% relative to a greedy algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102331.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"272","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A noncooperative game for double auction-based energy trading between PHEVs and distribution grids","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","energy storage","game theory","power distribution economics","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncooperative game","double auction based energy trading","PHEV","distribution grids","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","smart grid system","decision making processes","power market","energy surplus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A noncooperative game for double auction-based energy trading between PHEVs and distribution grids","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102331/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440879","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A noncooperative game for double auction-based energy trading between PHEVs and distribution grids","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p267saad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061228S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6102335,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh Rao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Rao","id":"38241007500"},{"name":"Srinivas Akella","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Akella","id":"37280235600"},{"name":"Gokhan Guley","affiliation":["Smart Grid Technology, HiSoft Technology Intl., Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Guley","id":"38234089300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1702-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102335","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":451},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Measurement","Electricity","Smart grids","Probability distribution","Mathematical model","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","power meters","power system measurement","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line carrier","signal analysis","residential smart meters","outlier detection","PLC signal strength","transmission problems","local power outages","communication node","transformer","signal strength distribution"]}],"abstract":"A method for identifying outliers among a set of smart meters by using the power line carrier (PLC) signal strength is presented in this paper.

In addition, smart pricing can be used to seek social benefits and to achieve social objectives. However, the utility company may need to collect various information about users and their energy consumption behavior, which can be challenging. That is, users may not be willing to reveal their local information unless there is an incentive for them to do so. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing algorithm to tackle this problem. The benefit that each user obtains from each appliance can be modeled in form of a utility function, a concept from microeconomics. We propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) based mechanism for our problem formulation aiming to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the aggregate utility functions of all users minus the total energy cost. Our design requires that each user provides some information about its energy demand. In return, the energy provider will determine each user's payment for electricity. The payment of each user is structured in such a way that it is in each user's self interest to reveal its local information truthfully. Finally, we present simulation results to show that both the energy provider and the individual users can benefit from the proposed pricing algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102349.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"374","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal energy consumption scheduling using mechanism design for the future smart grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Home appliances","Energy consumption","Vectors","Pricing","Nash equilibrium","Simulation","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand side management","energy consumption","pricing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal energy consumption scheduling","mechanism design","smart grid","demand side","smart pricing","Vickrey-Clarke-Groves based mechanism","energy provider"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal energy consumption scheduling using mechanism design for the future smart grid","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102349/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440897","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal energy consumption scheduling using mechanism design for the future smart grid","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p369samadi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110132S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6102353,"authors":[{"name":"Shengrong Bu","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Shengrong Bu","id":"37544252700"},{"name":"F.

Real-time pricing is one of the most important DSM strategies. Moreover, in an electricity market, retailers procure electricity from various electricity sources, and then sell it to customers. Therefore, it is critical for retailers to make effective procurement and price decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretical decision-making scheme for electricity retailers in the smart grid using real-time pricing DSM. We model and analyze the interactions between the retailer and electricity customers as a four-stage Stackelberg game.

CDR leverages data-centric communication, publisher/subscriber and topic-based group communication to make demand response secure, scalable and reliable. To the utility, CDR appears to be a black box function call that takes an input from the utility, e.g., power deficit and gives an output to the utility, e.g., power reduction per customer and the corresponding price incentive. Using this implementation framework, we propose two market-based distributed algorithms (bisection and Illinois methods). The proposed algorithms exhibit at least exponentially fast convergence with O(1) iteration as the number of customers grows and outperform prior work of the dual gradient method in terms of convergence speed while keeping the same messaging overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102355.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"403","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud-based demand response for smart grid: Architecture and distributed algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Convergence","Servers","Cost function","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed algorithms","iterative methods","power engineering computing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud-based demand response","smart grid","distributed algorithm","master-slave based demand response","host address-centric communication","data-centric communication","publisher-subscriber","topic-based group communication","black box function call","bisection method","Illinois method","iteration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-based demand response for smart grid: Architecture and distributed algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102355/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440903","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-based demand response for smart grid: Architecture and distributed algorithms","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p398kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055973S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6102366,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Farivar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Farivar","id":"38233801900"},{"name":"Christopher R.

Hence Volt/VAR control over radial networks is efficiently solvable. Simulations of a real-world distribution circuit illustrates that the proposed inverter control achieves significant improvement over the IEEE 1547 standard in terms of power quality and power savings.","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102366","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102366.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverter VAR control for distribution systems with renewables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102366/","displayDocTitle":"Inverter VAR control for distribution systems with renewables","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440914","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102366/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverter VAR control for distribution systems with renewables","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p457farivar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098099S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6102368,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Pasqualetti","affiliation":["Center of Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation, University of California,\u00a0Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pasqualetti","id":"37827824800"},{"name":"Ruggero Carli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Ruggero","lastName":"Carli","id":"37321478500"},{"name":"Francesco Bullo","affiliation":["Center of Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation, University of California,\u00a0Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Bullo","id":"37282169800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1702-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102368","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":595},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102368","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Monitoring","Transmission line measurements","State estimation","Equations","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","load flow","power engineering computing","power system control","power system state estimation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed method","power system state estimation","false data detection","power networks","control centers","state vector","voltage magnitude","network buses","power flows","current injections","minimum variance estimate","network measurements","diffusive interaction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102368","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102368.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","startPage":"469","endPage":"474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed method for state estimation and false data detection in power networks","abstract":"This work presents a distributed method for control centers to monitor the operating condition of a power network.

We consider the state to be linearly related to network measurements, which include power flows, current injections, and voltages phasors at some buses. We admit the presence of several cooperating control centers, and we design two distributed methods for them to compute the minimum variance estimate of the state given the network measurements. The two distributed methods rely on different modes of cooperation among control centers: in the first method an incremental mode of cooperation is assumed, whereas, in the second method, a diffusive interaction is implemented. These estimation methods, which are proved to converge in finite time, are further exploited to develop a distributed algorithm to detect corrupted data among network measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102368/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12440916","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102368/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A distributed method for state estimation and false data detection in power networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed method for state estimation and false data detection in power networks","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p469pasqualetti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065763S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6102379,"authors":[{"name":"Navin Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Navin","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37074575900"},{"name":"Pranshu Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Pranshu","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085787673"},{"name":"David Irwin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Irwin","id":"37276192200"},{"name":"Prashant Shenoy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Shenoy","id":"37267888500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1702-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102379","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":177,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4975},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Weather forecasting","Measurement","Kernel","Support vector machines","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","power engineering computing","regression analysis","smart power grids","solar power","solar power stations","support vector machines","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solar generation prediction","NWS weather forecast","machine learning","smart grid initiative","grid energy fraction","large-scale solar farm","regression technique","linear least squares","support vector machines","National Weather Service"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102379","abstract":"A key goal of smart grid initiatives is significantly increasing the fraction of grid energy contributed by renewables. One challenge with integrating renewables into the grid is that their power generation is intermittent and uncontrollable. Thus, predicting future renewable generation is important, since the grid must dispatch generators to satisfy demand as generation varies. While manually developing sophisticated prediction models may be feasible for large-scale solar farms, developing them for distributed generation at millions of homes throughout the grid is a challenging problem. To address the problem, in this paper, we explore automatically creating site-specific prediction models for solar power generation from National Weather Service (NWS) weather forecasts using machine learning techniques. We compare multiple regression techniques for generating prediction models, including linear least squares and support vector machines using multiple kernel functions. We evaluate the accuracy of each model using historical NWS forecasts and solar intensity readings from a weather station deployment for nearly a year. Our results show that SVM-based prediction models built using seven distinct weather forecast metrics are 27% more accurate for our site than existing forecast-based models.","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102379","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093618/6102296/06102379.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"533","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting solar generation from weather forecasts using machine learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Predicting solar generation from weather forecasts using machine learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12440927","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6102379/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting solar generation from weather forecasts using machine learning","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p528sharma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072226S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093618","isNumber":"6102296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093618","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"6102296","articleId":"6102379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6102417,"authors":[{"name":"Stig Petersen","affiliation":["Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet, Trondheim, NO"],"bio":{"p":["Stig Petersen (stig.petersen@sintef.no) received his M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in 2000.

Particular challenges include the resource and bandwidth constraints on sensor nodes, the spatiotemporally dynamic network behaviors, and the lack of accurate models to understand such behaviors in a hostile environment. In this paper, we present the Sensor Anomaly Visualization Engine (SAVE), a system that fully leverages the power of both visualization and anomaly detection analytics to guide the user to quickly and accurately diagnose sensor network failures and faults. SAVE combines customized visualizations over separate sensor data facets as multiple coordinated views. Temporal expansion model, correlation graph and dynamic projection views are proposed to effectively interpret the topological, correlational and dimensional sensor data dynamics and their anomalies. Through a case study with real-world sensor network system and administrators, we demonstrate that SAVE is able to help better locate the system problem and further identify the root cause of major sensor network failure scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093899/6102423/06102458.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2011.6102458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAVE: Sensor anomaly visualization engine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Data visualization","Correlation","Network topology","Time series analysis","Wireless sensor networks","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","data analysis","data visualisation","fault diagnosis","security of data","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor anomaly visualization engine","visualization analytics","anomaly detection analytics","sensor network failure","sensor network faults","sensor data facets","temporal expansion model","correlation graph","dynamic projection view","sensor data dynamics","sensor network failure scenario"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SAVE: Sensor anomaly visualization engine","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102458/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437422","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"23-28 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAVE: Sensor anomaly visualization engine","confLoc":"Providence, RI, USA","sourcePdf":"201210shi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119891S","chronDate":"23-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093899","isNumber":"6102423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093899","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6102423","articleId":"6102458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6102461,"authors":[{"name":"Wenwen Dou","affiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Wenwen","lastName":"Dou","id":"37606064200"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Wang","affiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601069300"},{"name":"Remco Chang","affiliation":["Tufts University, USA"],"firstName":"Remco","lastName":"Chang","id":"37592409400"},{"name":"William Ribarsky","affiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Ribarsky","id":"37300425000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0014-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0015-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102461","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":868},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102461","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Visualization","Entropy","Analytical models","Text analysis","Semantics","Text processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data visualisation","probability","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ParallelTopics system","probabilistic approach","document collection","text corpora analysis","visual analytics system","latent Dirichlet allocation","interactive visualization","parallel coordinate metaphor","single-topic document","multitopic document"]},{"kwd":["H.5.2 [INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfaces\u2014Graphical user interfaces (GUI)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VAST.2011.6102461","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093899/6102423/06102461.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2011.6102461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ParallelTopics: A probabilistic approach to exploring document collections","abstract":"Scalable and effective analysis of large text corpora remains a challenging problem as our ability to collect textual data continues to increase at an exponential rate. To help users make sense of large text corpora, we present a novel visual analytics system, Parallel-Topics, which integrates a state-of-the-art probabilistic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with interactive visualization. To describe a corpus of documents, ParallelTopics first extracts a set of semantically meaningful topics using LDA. Unlike most traditional clustering techniques in which a document is assigned to a specific cluster, the LDA model accounts for different topical aspects of each individual document. This permits effective full text analysis of larger documents that may contain multiple topics. To highlight this property of the model, ParallelTopics utilizes the parallel coordinate metaphor to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. Such representation allows the users to discover single-topic vs. multi-topic documents and the relative importance of each topic to a document of interest. In addition, since most text corpora are inherently temporal, ParallelTopics also depicts the topic evolution over time. We have applied ParallelTopics to exploring and analyzing several text corpora, including the scientific proposals awarded by the National Science Foundation and the publications in the VAST community over the years. To demonstrate the efficacy of ParallelTopics, we conducted several expert evaluations, the results of which are reported in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6102461/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12437425","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ParallelTopics: A probabilistic approach to exploring document collections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ParallelTopics: A probabilistic approach to exploring document collections","confLoc":"Providence, RI, USA","sourcePdf":"231240dou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06869S","chronDate":"23-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093899","isNumber":"6102423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093899","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6102423","articleId":"6102461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6102527,"authors":[{"name":"A.

New grid elements such as distributed energy generation and PHEVs will necessitate changes in these existing communication networks. These changes will be dictated by the need for new control operations that will allow efficient management of these new elements and that cannot be supported by the existing communication infra structure. Moreover, the smart grid will let households man age energy usage more efficiently through AMI and HEMSs. The realization of these systems will require pushing communication networks far out from the network core and deep into homes and buildings. We have presented the communication requirements of the smart grid, and we have identified the main technical challenges that need to be tackled. The only viable way to fulfill these requirements is to design a new communication architecture that can support smart grid services and control operations. This future communication architecture will need to take advantage of the recent progress made in communication technologies and protocols. It will require the introduction of communications technologies that were not considered in the past. In addition, this communication architecture will need to be reliable, scalable, and extendable to future smart grid services and applications.","doi":"10.1109/MPE.2011.943134","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power and Energy Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/8014/6102579/06102587.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPE.2011.943134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power and Energy Magazine","startPage":"24","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Links to the Future: Communication Requirements and Challenges in the Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Links to the Future: Communication Requirements and Challenges in the Smart Grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102587/","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6102587/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425288","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Links to the Future: Communication Requirements and Challenges in the Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"10mpe01-bouhafs.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049631S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8014","isNumber":"6102579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8014","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6102579","articleId":"6102587","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6102727,"authors":[{"name":"Claudiu Lung","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Engineering Department, North University of Baia Mare, Baia Mare, Romania"],"firstName":"Claudiu","lastName":"Lung","id":"37531651300"},{"name":"Sebastian Sabou","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Engineering Department, North University of Baia Mare, Baia Mare, Romania"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Sabou","id":"38233549500"},{"name":"Ioan Orha","affiliation":["Electronic and Computer Engineering Department, North University of Baia Mare, Baia Mare, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Orha","id":"37543201600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1277-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1276-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1275-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102727","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","control engineering computing","embedded systems","hardware description languages","radio networks","telecommunication computing","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication control system","embedded system","digilent Nexys board","Spartan-3E starter kit board","VHDL","Xilinx Spartan-3","Spartan-3E FPGA","keyboard controller","UART controller","Windows XP PC","Xilinx ISE8.2.03i","CAD tool","Cadence Oread tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","PicoBlaze","VHDL","Embedded System","Radio"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design of an embedded system for the assistance of persons with handicaps, implemented into the Digilent Nexys Board and Spartan-3E Starter Kit Board.

For this amplifier, second and fourth harmonics are rejected by the bias circuit, while third and fifth harmonics are rejected by the filter. Due to the interdigital hairpin line structure of the filter, the blocking capacitor is not needed in the load matching network. Comparing with the harmonic control structure constructed by conventional \u03bb/4 transmission line, the size of this amplifier circuit is reduced.

The proposed idea has been validated performing several experimental measurements on an X-Band GaAs MMIC Doherty amplifier. In particular, the region of high and flat efficiency has been extended from 6dB to 11dB of output power back-off, without affecting gain and reached output power levels. As a result, a real average efficiency improvement of about 81% in the added 5dB of output back-off has been achieved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102757","publicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6089237/6102757/06102827.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New generation of multi-step Doherty amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"New generation of multi-step Doherty amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6102827/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437215","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102827/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New generation of multi-step Doherty amplifier","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044841S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6089237","isNumber":"6102757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6089237","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6102757","articleId":"6102827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6102846,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Bathich","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Bathich","id":"37393260900"},{"name":"Daniel Gruner","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Gruner","id":"37542668300"},{"name":"Georg Boeck","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Boeck","id":"37282337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-236-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102846","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":881},"abstract":"A dual-band Doherty amplifier architecture is proposed and analysed.

The result is a reduction in the maximum obtainable efficiency and linearity performance for a given input power level. By driving the carrier and peaking power amplifiers independently, it is possible to present the optimum load to the carrier stage for either maximum efficiency, linearity or anywhere in between for any input power level. This paper proposes the injection of a controllable current into the load to create the required active load-pull. Simulations in ADS using a 10W GaN HEMT device are presented for maximum efficiency. Two different Doherty power combining networks are used and the required current for each network is explained. Measurements of a class-F amplifier in a Doherty current injection architecture are taken and drain efficiency versus output power is plotted showing a potential of 10dB dynamic range of output power with a tracked drain efficiency between 65-70%.","startPage":"296","endPage":"299","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6089237/6102757/06102881.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized load modulation in a Doherty amplifier using a current injection technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimized load modulation in a Doherty amplifier using a current injection technique","conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102881/","accessionNumber":"12437269","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102881/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized load modulation in a Doherty amplifier using a current injection technique","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058898S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6089237","isNumber":"6102757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6089237","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6102757","articleId":"6102881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6102882,"authors":[{"name":"Neal Tuffy","affiliation":["RF & Microwave Research Group, University College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Neal","lastName":"Tuffy","id":"37947650500"},{"name":"Anding Zhu","affiliation":["RF & Microwave Research Group, University College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Anding","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37277394200"},{"name":"Thomas J.

To maintain high efficiency during the transition between the two PA modes an active second harmonic injection at the output of the main transistor is employed through an addition of an auxiliary low power amplifier. To demonstrate the validity of the novel concept a demonstrator is realized around a 10 W GaN transistor with an average efficiency of 63% across 0.6-2.4 GHz at only modest gain compression of 1dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6089237/6102757/06102920.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"187","publicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6102920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide band high-efficiency power amplifier design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Bandwidth","Power amplifiers","Impedance","Transistors","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide band high-efficiency power amplifier design","hybrid power amplifier","passive power amplifier","active power amplifier","wideband high drain efficiency power amplifier design","dual-band PA","active second harmonic injection","low power amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["broadband amplifier","high efficiency","injection amplifier","microwave amplifier","power amplifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Wide band high-efficiency power amplifier design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6102920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437308","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide band high-efficiency power amplifier design","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035324S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6089237","isNumber":"6102757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6089237","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6102757","articleId":"6102920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6102922,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This investigation is important when the power amplifier (PA) is fed with bi-level pulses with a duty cycle different from the typical value of 50 %. This is the case in bandpass delta-sigma (BPDS) modulation where the duty cycle of the output pulses may vary from 0 % to 100 % based on the type of modulation and signal statistics. Simulation results show that the class-E PA is less sensitive to the variation of the duty cycle than the class-F and the class-D modes of operation. Therefore class-E PA is the best choice to be employed in band-pass delta-sigma based transmitter designs. Besides the PAs performance comparison, a correction on the efficiency calculation of the SMPAs driven by a duty cycle varying signal, is proposed in this paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6102757","publicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6089237/6102757/06102927.pdf","startPage":"312","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of the class of switching-mode power amplifiers on the efficiency of band-pass delta-sigma architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effect of the class of switching-mode power amplifiers on the efficiency of band-pass delta-sigma architectures","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6102927/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437315","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6102927/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of the class of switching-mode power amplifiers on the efficiency of band-pass delta-sigma architectures","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"1881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051735S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6089237","isNumber":"6102757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6089237","xplore-issue":"6102757","articleId":"6102927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6102930,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Johnson","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37290740300"},{"name":"Kelly Mekechuk","affiliation":["PWRF, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kelly","lastName":"Mekechuk","id":"37571737600"},{"name":"David Kelly","affiliation":["PWRF, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kelly","id":"37575617800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-236-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6102930","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":227},"abstract":"Most published research related to RF switch-mode amplifiers has used sigma-delta modulation techniques to generate encoded pulse trains for amplification in the switching stage. A constraint in sigma-delta modulation is that zero-crossings are restricted to occur synchronously with a clock edge in the quantizer. In this paper, the zero crossing constraint is relaxed and a new encoder is analyzed that is based on noise shaped pulse position modulation. A comparison is made between the two encoders. Comparative examples of a fourth order noise shaping loop filter show that coding efficiency is increased by up to 2.1 dB which will directly translate into an improvement in power efficiency in the switch mode amplifier. The work motivates further research into the design of better time encoders for RF switch-mode power amplifier applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Sigma delta

The simulation results show that SSSA has reduces average delay, delay viability and Packet Drop rate (PDR) of RT traffic and fulfils throughput requirements of NRT streaming video traffic while keeping the system overall throughput and fairness among users at a good level.","doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2011.22","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099687/6103007/06103024.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BWCCA.2011.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103007","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service Specific Queue Sorting and Scheduling Algorithm for OFDMA-Based LTE-Advanced Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Service Specific Queue Sorting and Scheduling Algorithm for OFDMA-Based LTE-Advanced Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103024/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439676","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6103024/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Specific Queue Sorting and Scheduling Algorithm for OFDMA-Based LTE-Advanced Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4532a116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112175S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099687","isNumber":"6103007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099687","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6103007","articleId":"6103024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6103025,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Movahedian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Movahedian","id":"37936569700"},{"name":"Michael McGuire","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"McGuire","id":"37433706100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1455-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4532-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103025","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Receivers","Kalman filters","Equalizers","Vectors","Fading","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","frequency selective surfaces","iterative methods","Kalman filters","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative radio receiver","Kalman filter","wireless communication channel","time selective fading channel","frequency selective fading channel","low error rate communication channel","joint channel state estimation method","data detection system","signal equalization","symbol sequence detection","virtual pilot signal","BER performance","channel gain information"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103025","doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2011.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BWCCA.2011.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103007","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099687/6103007/06103025.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Receiver for Fast Fading Channels Using Two Kalman Filters","abstract":"There is a demand for high data rate wireless communications over channels which are subject to both time selective and frequency selective fading. To obtain low error rate communications over these channels with the previously proposed channel estimation methods requires a large proportion of the transmitted signal to be dedicated to pilots and/or extensive computations in the radio receivers. This paper proposes a joint channel estimation and data detection system based on two Kalman filters. One Kalman filter is used to estimate the channel state while the second Kalman filter is used for signal equalization. An iterative procedure is used to allow for accurate data detection without requiring a high proportion of pilots. In each iteration of the receiver, the detected symbol sequence from the previous iteration is used as a virtual pilot signal to improve the accuracy of channel estimation.

The Pervasive Web would be effectively enabled when physical things are seamlessly connected to the Web, offering real-world services to users. In a previous work, we examined the feasibility of utilizing existing online social networking platforms, to create a social smart home that promotes sharing of sensor and household devices between family members.

Conventional channel estimation methods require that a pair of stations tune to the same channel, and then estimate the channel gain by transmitting some pilot signals. These methods are thus time-consuming and inefficient in multi-user cognitive radio networks. Moreover, wireless channels are affected by the small-scale fading. A one-time sample of a channel gain is thus noisy, and the small-scale fading would lead to estimation errors. In this paper we propose a kernel-based channel gain estimation method. We adopt the support vector regression to build the knowledge between the location information of each station pair and the corresponding channel gain. Such a kernel-based method is noise-resistant and time-saving. We perform a real-world experiment to measure GSM signals, and use the measurement to evaluate the performance of the proposed channel gain estimation method. Experiment results show that the proposed method with sufficient training data could achieve the root mean square error of channel gain estimation as low as 2 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12439692","htmlLink":"/document/6103040/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Kernel-Based Channel Gain Estimation for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel-Based Channel Gain Estimation for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4532a236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074816S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099687","isNumber":"6103007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099687","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6103007","articleId":"6103040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6103085,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"},{"name":"Tan-Hsu Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tan-Hsu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274123600"},{"name":"Hsing-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, ASIA University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsing-Chung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539854700"},{"name":"Cheng-Min Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Min","lastName":"Yeh","id":"38237871100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1455-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4532-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103085","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","OFDM","Delay","Detectors","Mobile communication","Interference","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","interference suppression","mobile radio","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive parallel interference cancellation","OFDM mobile communication systems","multiuser detector","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multiuser interference","bit error rate performance","block sub carrier assignment scheme","block interleaved subcarrier assignment scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA communication systems","multiuser detection","near far problems","multi-user interference","parallel interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance of parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multiuser detector in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) mobile communication systems is investigated.

In these researches, features such as the IP address and the port number are used as the probabilistic variables. The method based on multiple variables has not been proposed to aim to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection. If the number of packets increase, these packets are classified into BINs before the calculation of chi-square method. The classification method depends on the calculation parameters such as the window width and the number of BIN, and the packet distribution of night and day time. In addition, the classification method should be changed based on these parameters. In this paper, we propose the dynamic BIN method to classify the incoming packets automatically. We also propose the CSDM (Chi-square-based Space Division Method) to detect anomaly attacks using the dynamic BIN methods with multiple probabilistic variables. As the results of experiments using the source IP address, the destination port number, and the interval time deviation of arriving packets as the probabilistic variables, the proposed dynamic BIN realized the equal classification, which does not depends on the features of packets and the number of BIN. In addition, the dynamic BIN mechanism and CSDM method using two probabilistic variables could improve F-measure compared to the conventional method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anomaly Detection System Based on Chi-Square Method with Dynamic BIN Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2011.89","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099687/6103007/06103092.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BWCCA.2011.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Anomaly Detection System Based on Chi-Square Method with Dynamic BIN Algorithm","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103092/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12439744","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anomaly Detection System Based on Chi-Square Method with Dynamic BIN Algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4532a549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063187S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099687","isNumber":"6103007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099687","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6103007","articleId":"6103092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6103133,"authors":[{"name":"Joanna Kolodziej","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bielsko-BiaBa, Bielsko-Biala, Poland"],"firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Kolodziej","id":"37397617200"},{"name":"Samee Ullah Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Samee Ullah","lastName":"Khan","id":"37286195400"},{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Department of Languages and Informatics Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1448-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4531-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103133","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":606},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103133","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Vectors","Processor scheduling","Voltage control","Optimization","Energy consumption","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","genetic algorithms","grid computing","power aware computing","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","energy-aware scheduling","computational grids","quality of service","QoS","biobjective minimization","energy consumption","dynamic voltage scaling","DVS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational Grids","Scheduling","Multi-objective Optimization","Energy-awareness","Makespan"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3PGCIC.2011.13","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099686/6103130/06103133.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3PGCIC.2011.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Energy-Aware Scheduling in Computational Grids","abstract":"Because of its sheer size, Computational Grids (CGs) require advanced methodologies and strategies to efficiently schedule users tasks and applications to resources. Scheduling becomes even more challenging when energy efficiency, classical make span criterion and user perceived Quality of Service (QoS) are treated as first-class objectives in CG resource allocation methodologies. In this paper we approach the independent batch scheduling in CG as a biobjective minimization problem with make span and energy consumption as the scheduling criteria. We use the Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) methodology for reducing the cumulative power energy utilized by the system resources. We develop two Genetic Algorithms (GAs) with elitist and struggle replacement mechanisms as energy-aware schedulers. The proposed algorithms were experimentally evaluated for four CG size scenarios in static and dynamic modes. The simulation results showed that our proposed GA-based schedulers fairly reduce the energy usage to a level that is sufficient to maintain the desired quality level(-s).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103133/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12439622","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103133/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Energy-Aware Scheduling in Computational Grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithms for Energy-Aware Scheduling in Computational Grids","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4531a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10225S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099686","isNumber":"6103130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099686","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6103130","articleId":"6103133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6103145,"authors":[{"name":"Darshika G.

The current clinical practice typically uses the wheelchair tilt and recline to attain specific seating angles (sitting postures) to reduce seating pressure in order to prevent pressure ulcers. The rationale is to allow the development of reactive hyperemia to re-perfuse the ischemic tissues. However, our study reveals that a particular tilt and recline setting may result in a significant increase of skin perfusion for one person with SCI, but may cause neutral or even negative effect on another person. Therefore, an individualized guidance on wheelchair tilt and recline usage is desirable in people with various levels of SCI. In this study, we intend to demonstrate the feasibility of using machine-learning techniques to classify and predict favorable wheelchair tilt and recline settings for individual wheelchair users with SCI. Specifically, we use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify whether a given tilt and recline setting would cause a positive, neutral, or negative skin perfusion response. The challenge, however, is that ANN is prone to over fitting, a situation in which ANN can perfectly classify the existing data while cannot correctly classify new (unseen) data. We investigate using the genetic algorithm (GA) to train ANN to reduce the chance of converging on local optima and improve the generalization capability of classifying unseen data. Our experimental results indicate that the GA-based ANN significantly improves the generalization ability and outperforms the traditional statistical approach and other commonly used classification techniques, such as BP-based ANN and support vector machine (SVM). To the best of our knowledge, there are no such intelligent systems available now. Our research fills in the gap in existing evidence.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.13","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103302.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Artificial Neural Network to Determine Favorable Wheelchair Tilt and Recline Usage in People with Spinal Cord Injury: Training ANN with Genetic Algorithm to Improve Generalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Using Artificial Neural Network to Determine Favorable Wheelchair Tilt and Recline Usage in People with Spinal Cord Injury: Training ANN with Genetic Algorithm to Improve Generalization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12440023","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6103302/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Artificial Neural Network to Determine Favorable Wheelchair Tilt and Recline Usage in People with Spinal Cord Injury: Training ANN with Genetic Algorithm to Improve Generalization","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090552S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6103318,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Ramlakhan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Ramlakhan","id":"38234196700"},{"name":"Yi Shang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shang","id":"37279556200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2068-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1082-3409"}],"articleNumber":"6103318","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lesions","Malignant tumors","Cancer","Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Skin","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","cancer","feature extraction","image classification","image colour analysis","image recognition","image segmentation","medical image processing","mobile computing","patient diagnosis","skin","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile automated skin lesion classification system","melanoma skin cancer account","automated diagnosis","early detection","image-based automated melanoma recognition system","Android smartphone","feature calculation","mobile device","skin lesion image classification","monochrome image segmentation","outline contour detection","shape feature","color feature","kNN classifier","test image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["melanoma","skin lesion","image segmentation","classification","smartphone","Android"]}],"abstract":"Melanoma skin cancer accounts for less than 5% of skin cancer cases but causes the most deaths due to skin cancer.

Tools to automate the testing process minor its costs, however they generate large test suites with redundant Test Cases (TC). Automatic TC Selection aims to reduce a test suite based on some selection criterion. This process can be treated as an optimization problem, aiming to find a subset of TCs which optimizes one or more objective functions (i.e., selection criteria). The majority of search-based works focus on single-objective selection. In this light, we developed a mechanism for functional TC selection which considers two objectives simultaneously: maximize requirements' coverage while minimizing cost in terms of TC execution effort. This mechanism was implemented as a multi-objective optimization process based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We implemented two multi-objective versions of PSO (BMOPSO and BMOPSO-CDR). The experiments were performed on two real test suites, revealing very satisfactory results (attesting the feasibility of the proposed approach). We highlight that execution effort is an important aspect in the testing process, and it has not been used in a multi-objective way together with requirements coverage for functional TC selection.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.45","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103335.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"252","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization for Test Case Selection Based on Functional Requirements Coverage and Execution Effort","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization for Test Case Selection Based on Functional Requirements Coverage and Execution Effort","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12440056","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6103335/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization for Test Case Selection Based on Functional Requirements Coverage and Execution Effort","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068584S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6103337,"authors":[{"name":"Dung H.

The proposed indicator-based EMOA, called SMSPEMOA, is designed as an extension to SMS-EMOA, which is one of the most successfully and widely used indicator based EMOAs. SMSP-EMOA uses the prospect indicator in its parent selection and the hyper volume indicator in its environmental selection. The prospect indicator measures the potential (or prospect) of each individual to reproduce offspring that dominate itself and spread out in the objective space. It allows the parent selection operator to (1) maintain sufficient selection pressure, even in high dimensional MOPs, thereby improving convergence velocity toward the Pareto-optimal front, and (2) diversify individuals, even in high dimensional MOPs, thereby spreading out individuals in the objective space. Experimental results show that SMSP-EMOA's parent selection operator complement its environmental selection operator. SMSP-EMOA outperforms SMS-EMOA and well-known traditional EMOAs in optimality and convergence velocity without sacrificing the diversity of individuals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103337.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMSP-EMOA: Augmenting SMS-EMOA with the Prospect Indicator for Multiobjective Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Hypercubes","Heuristic algorithms","Measurement","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SMSP-EMOA","prospect indicator","evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm","parent selection","environmental selection operators","Pareto-optimal front"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOAs)","Quality indicators","Indicator-based EMOAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SMSP-EMOA: Augmenting SMS-EMOA with the Prospect Indicator for Multiobjective Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103337/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440058","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMSP-EMOA: Augmenting SMS-EMOA with the Prospect Indicator for Multiobjective Optimization","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07727S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6103338,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Farouk Abdel Hady","affiliation":["Institute of Neural Information Processing, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed Farouk Abdel","lastName":"Hady","id":"38234195800"},{"name":"Wesam Herbawi","affiliation":["Institute of Media Informatics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Wesam","lastName":"Herbawi","id":"37705877300"},{"name":"Michael Weber","affiliation":["Institute of Media Informatics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Weber","id":"37278363700"},{"name":"Friedhelm Schwenker","affiliation":["Institute of Neural Information Processing, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Friedhelm","lastName":"Schwenker","id":"37323323300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2068-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1082-3409"}],"articleNumber":"6103338","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103338","abstract":"Support vector machines (SVMs) often contain a large number of support vectors which reduce the run-time speeds of decision functions. In addition, this might cause an over fitting effect where the resulting SVM adapts itself to the noise in the training set rather than the true underlying data distribution and will probably fail to correctly classify unseen examples. To obtain more fast and accurate SVMs, many methods have been proposed to prune SVs in trained SVMs. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm to reduce the complexity of support vector machines as well as to improve generalization accuracy by the reduction of over fitting. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed evolutionary approach can effectively reduce the number of support vectors included in the decision functions of SVMs without sacrificing their classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.48","startPage":"269","endPage":"275","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103338.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Pruning Support Vector Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Training","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Complexity theory","Kernel","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective genetic algorithm","support vector machine pruning","data distribution","complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine learning","data mining","Support vector machines","multi-objective genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Pruning Support Vector Machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103338/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440059","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Pruning Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05941S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6103339,"authors":[{"name":"Dung H.

A quality indicator measures the goodness of each solution candidate. Many quality indicators have been proposed with the intention to capture different preferences in optimization. Therefore, indicator-based selection operators tend to have biased selection pressures that evolve solution candidates toward particular regions in the objective space. An open question is whether a set of existing indicator based selection operators can create a single operator that outperforms those existing ones. To address this question, this paper studies a method to aggregate (or boost) existing indicator-based selection operators. Experimental results show that a boosted selection operator outperforms exiting ones in optimality, diversity and convergence velocity. It also exhibits robustness against different characteristics in different optimization problems and yields stable performance to solve them.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103339.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting Indicator-Based Selection Operators for Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.49","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Boosting Indicator-Based Selection Operators for Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440060","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6103339/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting Indicator-Based Selection Operators for Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086899S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-31"},{"_id":6103349,"authors":[{"name":"Kensuke Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kensuke","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37877930100"},{"name":"Toshio Hirotsu","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Information Science, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Hirotsu","id":"37285094100"},{"name":"Toshiharu Sugawara","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiharu","lastName":"Sugawara","id":"37267315200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2068-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1082-3409"}],"articleNumber":"6103349","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103349","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Particle swarm optimization","Local area networks","Redundancy","Modulation","Equations","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local area networks","particle swarm optimisation","statistical analysis","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive routing point control","virtualized local area network","VLAN domains","binary particle swarm optimization","angle modulated particle swarm optimization","data link layer","arbitrary logical network","physical network","redundant traffic reduction","statistical method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Virtual LAN","Network Management","Routing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.59","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103349.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","startPage":"352","endPage":"360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Routing Point Control in Virtualized Local Area Networks Using Particle Swarm Optimizations","abstract":"This paper describes methods for controlling routing points of VLAN domains using binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and angle modulated particle swarm optimization (AMPSO). Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a technique for virtualizing data link layer (or L2) and can construct arbitrary logical networks on top of a physical network. However, VLAN often causes much redundant traffic due to inappropriate deployments of network-layer (L3) routing capabilities in VLAN networks. We propose two methods using BPSO and AMPSO, and show that they can adaptively select the routing points dynamically in accordance with the observed traffic patterns and thus reduce the redundant traffic. The convergence features are compared with those of the conventional method on the basis of a statistical method. Then we also show that the scalability of the algorithm using AMPOS is high and thus we can expect that it is applicable to practical large VLAN environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103349/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12440070","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103349/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Routing Point Control in Virtualized Local Area Networks Using Particle Swarm Optimizations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Routing Point Control in Virtualized Local Area Networks Using Particle Swarm Optimizations","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071646S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6103401,"authors":[{"name":"Moez Essaidi","affiliation":["LIPN-UMR CNRS 7030, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Nord, Villetaneuse, France"],"firstName":"Moez","lastName":"Essaidi","id":"38232308800"},{"name":"Aomar Osmani","affiliation":["LIPN-UMR CNRS 7030, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Nord, Villetaneuse, France"],"firstName":"Aomar","lastName":"Osmani","id":"37685148200"},{"name":"Celine Rouveirol","affiliation":["LIPN-UMR CNRS 7030, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Nord, Villetaneuse, France"],"firstName":"Celine","lastName":"Rouveirol","id":"37540822700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2068-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1082-3409"}],"articleNumber":"6103401","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Data models","Context","Data warehouses","Context modeling","Machine learning","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data warehouses","inductive logic programming","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformation learning","model driven data warehouse","experimental design","inductive logic programming","machine learning","expert contribution","transformation process","business transformation rules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-Driven Data Warehouse","Inductive Logic Programming","Dependent-Concept Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103401","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103401.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformation Learning in the Context of Model-Driven Data Warehouse: An Experimental Design Based on Inductive Logic Programming","abstract":"Model transformation in the context of Model-Driven Data Warehouse is ensured by human experts.

Experimental results support the conclusion that this approach is suitable to solve this kind of problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6103401/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440122","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transformation Learning in the Context of Model-Driven Data Warehouse: An Experimental Design Based on Inductive Logic Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformation Learning in the Context of Model-Driven Data Warehouse: An Experimental Design Based on Inductive Logic Programming","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063815S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6103404,"authors":[{"name":"Sherin M.

The proposed mechanism integrates an Evolutionary-based approach with a Fuzzy Particle Swarm data Clustering (EFPSC). Unlike other static and centralized clustering techniques, our proposed model can dynamically adapt to the changes and does not require a prior knowledge of the number of clusters in the datasets. It is more adaptive towards problems with dynamic changed information. It has a linear scaling behavior, which make it suitable for use on large data sets. In addition, swarm-based clustering has the capacity to work with any kind of data that can be described in terms of symmetric dissimilarities, and it imposes no assumptions on the shape of the clusters it works with. Finally, an important strength of the algorithm is its ability to automatically determine the number of clusters within the data. The adaptation scheme proposed in the algorithm make it possible to tune with structures exist within the data. One of the key advantages of the EFPSC is the selection of parameter values which offers the good combination of its setting that generates the efficient clustering results in the solution space. The principle of evolutionary approach including its properties like crossover and mutation made a concrete effect in the algorithm. In addition, the guiding rules, which are alignment, cohesion and separation rule, led to better solutions. Numerous experiments will be conducted using both synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. Cluster validity approaches are used to quantitatively evaluate the results of the clustering algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.113","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103404.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"724","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Hybrid Evolutionary-Based Data Clustering Using Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A New Hybrid Evolutionary-Based Data Clustering Using Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12440125","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6103404/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Hybrid Evolutionary-Based Data Clustering Using Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596a717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076457S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6103443,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Azadehgan","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Sufi Razi Institute of Higher Education, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Azadehgan","id":"38234326800"},{"name":"Alireza Sooni","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Sufi Razi Institute of Higher Education, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Sooni","id":"38234326700"},{"name":"Nafiseh Jafarian","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Sufi Razi Institute of Higher Education, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Nafiseh","lastName":"Jafarian","id":"37085959512"},{"name":"Deniz Khateri","affiliation":["school of Electrical Engineering, university of science and technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"Khateri","id":"38234326000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2068-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4596-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1082-3409"}],"articleNumber":"6103443","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103443","abstract":"Hybridization of intelligent techniques, coming from different computational intelligence areas, has become popular because of the growing awareness that such combinations frequently perform better than the individual techniques coming from computational intelligence.

Generally, practitioners utilize historical software data, including metric and fault data collected during the software development process, to build a classification model and then employ this model to predict new program modules as either fault-prone (fp) or not-fault-prone (nfp). Limited project resources can then be allocated according to the prediction results by (for example) assigning more reviews and testing to the modules predicted to be potentially defective. Two challenges often come with the modeling process: (1) high-dimensionality of software measurement data and (2) skewed or imbalanced distributions between the two types of modules (fp and nfp) in those datasets. To overcome these problems, extensive studies have been dedicated towards improving the quality of training data. The commonly used techniques are feature selection and data sampling. Usually, researchers focus on evaluating classification performance after the training data is modified. The present study assesses a feature selection technique from a different perspective. We are more interested in studying the stability of a feature selection method, especially in understanding the impact of data sampling techniques on the stability of feature selection when using the sampled data. Some interesting findings are found based on two case studies performed on datasets from two real-world software projects.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2011.172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2011.172","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1011","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101101/6103298/06103463.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Data Sampling on Stability of Feature Selection for Software Measurement Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Data Sampling on Stability of Feature Selection for Software Measurement Data","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103463/","accessionNumber":"12440184","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103463/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Data Sampling on Stability of Feature Selection for Software Measurement Data","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4596b004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071359S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101101","isNumber":"6103298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101101","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6103298","articleId":"6103463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6103540,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electronic & Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yuan","id":"38236336900"},{"name":"Heming Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic & Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Heming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290336100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1130-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4498-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103540","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Fault diagnosis","Electronic equipment","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Vectors","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","electronic equipment testing","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic equipment fault diagnosis algorithm","RBF neural network","electronic device failure diagnosis","failure diagnosis parameter sample sets","training process optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBFN","Electronic Equipment","Fault Diagnosis","LLS","K means"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103540","abstract":"This paper proposes an algorithm of failure diagnosis for electronic device.

This may because the algorithm had lost the ability of discovering that new or potential genetic material before convergence limited its search to solution space with wide range. Enlightened by hierarchical fair competition widely existed in nature, this paper has studied a model based on Pyramid model of hierarchical fair competition which uses pipeline structure divided sub-population rank according to fitness gradient, guarantee the recent discovery potential genetic material to obtain full development by maintaining a certain global selection pressure under reducing the local selection pressure of sub-population. Unlike traditional genetic algorithm's strategy which attempts to jumps out local optima region from high evolutional population included a high similarity \"building block\", the Pyramid model continuously maintain the sub-population with the medium fitness value to ensure keeping the multiplicity of the population by the strategy which the new local optima is bottom-up bred and processed unceasingly. Finally, this paper confirms the validity of the algorithm and the multiplicity of the population by HIFF128/256 problems based on binary encoding, and compared the improved algorithm from the solution quality and standard deviation of the population with traditional genetic algorithm, proves this improved algorithm can effectively alleviate premature convergence problem of the traditional genetic algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103542/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12439770","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103542/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Research on Genetic Algorithm Based on Pyramid Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Genetic Algorithm Based on Pyramid Model","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4498a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060133S","chronDate":"22-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099690","isNumber":"6103521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099690","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6103521","articleId":"6103542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6103545,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Digital Land Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province, East China Institute of Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wu","id":"38238383000"},{"name":"Yiquan Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Digital Land Key Laboratory of Jiangxi Province, East China Institute of Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yiquan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37351571600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1130-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4498-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103545","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","DH-HEMTs","Handheld computers","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","fuzzy set theory","geophysical image processing","object detection","pattern clustering","remote sensing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonsubsampled contourlet transform","unsupervised change detection","multitemporal remote sensing image","difference image","multitemporal images","geographical area","feature vector extraction","NSCT coefficient","change map","kernel fuzzy c-means clustering","KFCM clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multitemporal images","change detection","difference image","NSCT","KFCM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103545","doi":"10.1109/IPTC.2011.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTC.2011.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103521","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Symposium on Intelligence Information Processing and Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Symposium on Intelligence Information Processing and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099690/6103521/06103545.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitemporal Images Change Detection Using Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform and Kernel Fuzzy C-Means Clustering","abstract":"In this paper, an unsupervised change detection method for multitemporal remote sensing images is proposed.

For each pixel in the difference image, a feature vector is extracted using the NSCT coefficients and the difference image itself which are in the same position. The final change map is achieved by clustering the feature vectors using kernel fuzzy c-means (KFCM) clustering algorithm into two classes: changed and unchanged.

As a result this approach is at the same time resistant against tampering and copy attacks. Our contribution is setting up the relationship between fragile watermark and robust watermark. We make use of DCT coefficients to embed watermark information.

This places the increase in energy consumption of mobile phones in the world at an alarming level. Wi-Pie or Wireless-Piezoelectric technique combines RF energy scavenging and piezoelectric energy harvesting technologies to provide an alternative method of powering mobile electronic devices. By placing piezoelectric crystals beneath the keypad of a mobile phone, we intend to generate a small voltage with every key press which could be stored in a secondary storage device like a capacitor. The charge accumulated in the device can then be transferred to the primary storage or the battery so that the use of external chargers can be minimized. Additional power management circuitry is used to intercept the known and the unknown sources of ambient RF radiations. The received RF power is converted to DC and conditioned before it's delivered to the load. Although the RF energy levels are low, a combination of the harvesting and scavenging techniques will provide a significant source of power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Mobile handsets","Batteries","Radio frequency","Capacitors","Mobile communication","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","energy harvesting","mobile handsets","piezoelectric devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wi-pie","energy harvesting","mobile electronic devices","energy consumption","mobile phones","wireless-piezoelectric technique","RF energy scavenging","piezoelectric crystals","power management circuitry","RF power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Piezoelectric","Mobile electronics","RF scavenging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GHTC.2011.43","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6100959/6103596/06103669.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GHTC.2011.43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wi-Pie: Energy Harvesting in Mobile Electronic Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wi-Pie: Energy Harvesting in Mobile Electronic Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103669/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103669/","accessionNumber":"12439919","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2011-Nov. 1 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wi-Pie: Energy Harvesting in Mobile Electronic Devices","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"4595a398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049827S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2011-Nov. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6100959","isNumber":"6103596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6100959","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6103596","articleId":"6103669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6103712,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Zang","affiliation":["School of Science and the State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Zang","id":"38235284400"},{"name":"Jiang-she Zhang","affiliation":["School of Science and the State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiang-she","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37367895600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4559-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-8998"}],"articleNumber":"6103712","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":467},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Training","Accuracy","Principal component analysis","Educational institutions","Pattern recognition","Glass"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["softmax discriminant classifier","SDC","nonlinear transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["softmax discriminant function","classifier","nonlinear transformation"]}],"abstract":"A simple but effective classifier, which is called soft max discriminant classifier or SDC for short, is presented.

But when the extracted fingerprint is damaged, a miscarriage of justice is likely to occur. And when the number of users becomes larger, the efficiency of algorithm declines rapidly. Here, combined ACC based on Euclidean Geometries (EG) with ECC, the first is used in the under layer.

Besides it can accommodate more users while it guarantees to find the same number of colluders.","doi":"10.1109/MINES.2011.88","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101103/6103708/06103776.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MINES.2011.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A C-secure Digital Fingerprinting Scheme Combined with Error-Correcting Code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103776/","displayDocTitle":"A C-secure Digital Fingerprinting Scheme Combined with Error-Correcting Code","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103776/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440342","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A C-secure Digital Fingerprinting Scheme Combined with Error-Correcting Code","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4559a297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071407S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101103","isNumber":"6103708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101103","xplore-issue":"6103708","articleId":"6103776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6103777,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiwei Cai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology, Peking University Founder Group Company, Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaiwei","lastName":"Cai","id":"37586165500"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Lu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology, Peking University Founder Group Company, Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37599114400"},{"name":"Jianguo Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology, Peking University Founder Group Company, Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Song","id":"38238566300"},{"name":"Xiao Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology, Peking University Founder Group Company, Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086017125"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4559-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-8998"}],"articleNumber":"6103777","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Forensics","Transform coding","Digital images","Image coding","Feature extraction","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","computer forensics","feature extraction","image classification","image watermarking","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind image tampering identification","histogram features","digital forensics","digital data authenticity verification","digital data integrality verification","forensic analysis","difference image histogram","support vector machine","SVM classifier training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital image forensics","tampering identification","difference image","histogram"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103777","doi":"10.1109/MINES.2011.116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MINES.2011.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103708","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101103/6103708/06103777.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Image Tampering Identification Based on Histogram Features","abstract":"Nowadays, digital forensics has emerged as an important research field with applications of authenticity/integrality verification for digital data. In this paper, we focus on image forensic techniques and propose a blind scheme for image tampering identification which is capable to determine the tampering type. Since tampering operations bring in changes to neighboring pixels, we suggest employing the difference image (the image composed of differences of adjacent pixels) for forensic analysis. More specifically, we take the histogram of difference image to construct a feature set, and then use these histogram features to train a Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier. In this way, the novel scheme can efficiently identify usual image operations such as scaling, JPEG compression, linear and nonlinear filtering. Besides, its superiority over other state-of-the-art work is also demonstrated experimentally.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6103777/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440343","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Blind Image Tampering Identification Based on Histogram Features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Image Tampering Identification Based on Histogram Features","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4559a300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052419S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6101103","isNumber":"6103708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6101103","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6103708","articleId":"6103777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6103825,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-jie Wu","affiliation":["School of Software, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing-jie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37066372800"},{"name":"Rui Huang","affiliation":["School of Software, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Huang","id":"38236851100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4559-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-8998"}],"articleNumber":"6103825","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":719},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Registers","Field programmable gate arrays","Wireless communication","Communication system security","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","microcontrollers","telecommunication network management","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based wireless security system","wireless communication technology","data security","security management strategy","encryption software","secure communication system","data encryption","data decryption","programmable devices","wireless channel","confidential data transmission method","AES-128 encryption algorithm","BCH algorithm","data protection","Xilinx Spartan-3AN FPGA family","RF modules","coprocessor","embedded controller","high-performance MCU","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Error Checking and Correction","2.4GHz","AES","BCH code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103825","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/6101103/6103708/06103825.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MINES.2011.82","doi":"10.1109/MINES.2011.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103708","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FPGA-Based Wireless Security System","abstract":"With the wireless communications technology in data security development, it increases the requirements for security and confidentiality, using the security management strategy and security technology faces new challenges.

The system design is typically formulated as the optimization of the weighted sum of the users' utility functions. In an attempt to obtain distributed algorithms in the case this sum is nonconvex, researchers have proposed pricing mechanisms which however are based on heuristics and valid only for a restricted class of problems. In this paper we propose a general framework for the distributed optimization of the nonconvex sum-utility function. Our main contributions are: i) the derivation for the first time of a general dynamic pricing mechanism, ii) a framework that can be easily particularized to well-known applications, giving rise to very efficient practical algorithms that outperform existing methods; and iii) the solution to the currently open problem of social optimization for MIMO multiuser systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on NETwork Games, Control and Optimization (NetGCooP 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093768/6103864/06103878.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"International Conference on NETwork Games, Control and Optimization (NetGCooP 2011)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed dynamic pricing for MIMO interfering multiuser systems: A unified approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Heuristic algorithms","Convergence","MIMO","Optimization","Interference","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","distributed algorithms","heuristic programming","MIMO communication","pricing","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed dynamic pricing","MIMO interfering multiuser systems","wireless networks","user utility functions","distributed algorithms","nonconvex pricing mechanisms","distributed optimization","nonconvex sum-utility function","general dynamic pricing mechanism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed dynamic pricing for MIMO interfering multiuser systems: A unified approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103878/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437341","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed dynamic pricing for MIMO interfering multiuser systems: A unified approach","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"22PID2132103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073937S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093768","isNumber":"6103864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093768","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6103864","articleId":"6103878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6103899,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9riaux","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"M\u00e9riaux","id":"37395102000"},{"name":"Samson Lasaulce","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Samson","lastName":"Lasaulce","id":"37284485800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0384-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0383-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103899","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Power control","Stochastic processes","Mathematical model","Equations","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","radio networks","radio receivers","radio transmitters","stochastic games","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean-field games","green power control","distributed wireless network","power control policy","energy consumption","control theory","Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Fleming equations","stochastic differential game","Nash equilibrium analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we consider a distributed wireless network where many transmitters communicate with a common receiver. Having the choice of their power control policy, transmitters are concerned with energy constraints: instantaneous energy-efficiency and long-term energy consumption. The individual optimization of the average energy-efficient utility over a finite horizon is studied by using control theory and a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Fleming equations is obtained. Even though the existence of a solution to the corresponding stochastic differential game is proven, the game is difficult to analyze when the number of transmitters is large (in particular, the Nash equilibrium analysis becomes hard and even impossible). But when the number of transmitters is large, the stochastic differential game converges to a mean-field game which is ruled by a more tractable system of equations. A condition for the uniqueness of the equilibrium of the mean-field game is given.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on NETwork Games, Control and Optimization (NetGCooP 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093768/6103864/06103899.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103864","publicationTitle":"International Conference on NETwork Games, Control and Optimization (NetGCooP 2011)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean-field games and green power control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mean-field games and green power control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103899/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103899/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437362","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean-field games and green power control","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"5PID2142133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05818S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093768","isNumber":"6103864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093768","xplore-issue":"6103864","articleId":"6103899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6103909,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technology, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"lastName":"Jie Zhao","id":"37898588500"},{"name":"Youming Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technology, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"lastName":"Youming Li","id":"37899077300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0347-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103909","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"abstract":"Removed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Removal: An efficient proportional resource allocation algorithm in MIMO-OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2011 Global Mobile Congress","doi":"10.1109/GMC.2011.6103909","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Global Mobile Congress","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093311/6103906/06103909.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GMC.2011.6103909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6103909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103909/","xploreNote":"Document Removed From IEEE Xplore: This document has been removed because it was submitted for publication without a completed copyright transfer form.

This brings frequent spectrum handoffs and degrades the performance of SU even results in service interrupt. Actually SU can still continue to transmit (Underlay) as long as the interference at PU does not exceed a certain threshold. However, the coverage of Underlay is restricted. To overcome aforementioned problem, it is proposed a multi-cell spectrum handoff scheme as a supplement on the coverage of Underlay. Simple additive weights decision algorithm with dynamic weights (SAW-DW) in spectrum handoff is used to select optimal target cell for SU to avoid service interrupt when SU exceeds Underlay constraint. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the scheme and algorithm can reduce the probability of handoff failure and service interrupt of SU and improve quality of service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103935/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12439843","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"17-18 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103935/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum handoff decision algorithm with dynamic weights in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum handoff decision algorithm with dynamic weights in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047148S","chronDate":"17-18 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093311","isNumber":"6103906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093311","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6103906","articleId":"6103935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6103937,"authors":[{"name":"Tiebin Wang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Tiebin Wang","id":"38238988500"},{"name":"Xuemei Guan","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Xuemei Guan","id":"38237670200"},{"name":"Keqi Wang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Keqi Wang","id":"37066904800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0348-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0346-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0347-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6103937","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) is an efficient technique to reduce the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals without any distortion.

They provide both a portable representation and a foundation upon which results can be validated and shared. Large-scale scientific workflows are executed on equally complex parallel and distributed resources, where many things can fail. Application scientists need to track the status of their workflows in real time, detect execution anomalies automatically, and perform troubleshooting - without logging into remote nodes or searching through thousands of log files. As part of the NSF Stampede project, we have developed an infrastructure to answer these needs. The infrastructure captures application-level logs and resource information, normalizes these to standard representations, and stores these logs in a centralized general-purpose schema. Higher-level tools mine the logs in real time to determine current status, predict failures, and detect anomalous performance.","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093621/6103944/06103988.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online workflow management and performance analysis with Stampede","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Online workflow management and performance analysis with Stampede","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6103988/","accessionNumber":"12441048","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6103988/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online workflow management and performance analysis with Stampede","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"842841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097149S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093621","isNumber":"6103944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093621","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6103944","articleId":"6103988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6104005,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Shian Wang","affiliation":["Network Operations Laboratory, Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ya-Shian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407561700"},{"name":"Chin-Ping Chuang","affiliation":["Network Operations Laboratory, Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Ping","lastName":"Chuang","id":"38235839800"},{"name":"Kuan-Hsiung Liang","affiliation":["Network Operations Laboratory, Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan-Hsiung","lastName":"Liang","id":"37997811900"},{"name":"Been-Hwang Liao","affiliation":["Network Operations Laboratory, Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Been-Hwang","lastName":"Liao","id":"38235547700"},{"name":"Shou-Yi Cheng","affiliation":["Network Operations Laboratory, Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shou-Yi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38004521200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-44-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-44-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-9605"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-963X"}],"articleNumber":"6104005","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Business","Protocols","Broadband communication","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","femtocellular radio","mobile communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated service provisioning","automated service management","integrated femtocell","cellular networks","mobile broadband data traffic","bandwidth demand","mobile operators","mobile data traffic","IEEE 802.11 wireless fidelity","Wi-Fi access points","operational expenditure","OPEX","end-to-end services provisioning","fixed-mobile providers","inter-provider service provisioning","information exchange interfaces","business management model","end-to-end quality assured services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile data offloading","Femtocell","Wi-Fi","Integrated Network","Automated service provisioning"]}],"abstract":"The explosion of the mobile broadband data traffic and the expected needs of ever increasing bandwidth demand present great challenges and opportunities for mobile operators. To mitigate the challenges, mobile operators usually offload mobile data traffic from cellular networks to alternative networks by utilizing IEEE 802.11 wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) access points and deploying femtocells to leverage their service offering and reduce their operational expenditure (OPEX). The end-to-end services provisioning and management of the integrated femtocell/Wi-Fi and cellular networks is one of the key challenges for fixed-mobile providers. The inter-provider service provisioning involves information exchange interfaces which are basically manually set up and managed. As a result, the service provisioning takes lots of time and work and the OPEX is increased. In this paper, we first describe the business management model of the integrated femtocell/Wi-Fi and cellular networks from the perspective of fixed-mobile providers. We then propose a platform of service provisioning and management for the integrated networks that aims at providing an automated end-to-end quality assured services. To support the provision of better and diversified services to users, advanced management functionality needs to be introduced in the integrated systems, which will enable optimum, end-to-end operation. Finally, the results show that the proposed service provisioning and management which is automated and optimized, significantly reduces the duration of inter-provider service delivery of the integrated network, and reduces the OPEX.","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093621/6103944/06104005.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated service provisioning and management for integrated femtocell/Wi-Fi and cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104005/","displayDocTitle":"Automated service provisioning and management for integrated femtocell/Wi-Fi and cellular networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441065","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104005/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated service provisioning and management for integrated femtocell/Wi-Fi and cellular networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"856491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067185S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093621","isNumber":"6103944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093621","xplore-issue":"6103944","articleId":"6104005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6104013,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Tajer","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique PAris DEscartes (LIPADE), France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Tajer","id":"38234676400"},{"name":"Ali Makke","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique PAris DEscartes (LIPADE), France"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Makke","id":"38234675400"},{"name":"Osman Salem","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique PAris DEscartes (LIPADE), France"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"Salem","id":"37679952400"},{"name":"Ahmed Mehaoua","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique PAris DEscartes (LIPADE), France"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Mehaoua","id":"37268462400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-44-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1588-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-44-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-9605"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-963X"}],"articleNumber":"6104013","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High definition video","Time series analysis","Data structures","IP networks","Probability distribution","Radiation detectors","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","security of data","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","flooding attack detection","denial of service attacks","Hellinger distance","Chi-square divergence","statistical divergence measures","false alarm ratio","sketch data structure","performance analysis","IP traces","MAWI","WIDE backbone network","network anomalies detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DDoS","TCP SYN Flooding","K-ary Sketch","Hellinger Distance","Chi-Square Divergence"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison between divergence measures for network anomaly detection","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103944","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093621/6103944/06104013.pdf","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104013","abstract":"This paper deals with the detection of flooding attacks which are the most common type of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Most network anomaly detection systems proposed so far employ a supervised strategy to accomplish the task, using either signature-based detection methods or supervised-learning techniques. However, both approaches present major limitations: the former fails to detect and characterize unknown anomalies (letting the network unprotected for long periods), the latter requires training and labelled traffic, which is difficult and expensive to produce. Such limitations impose a serious bottleneck to the previously presented problem. We introduce an unsupervised approach to detect and characterize network anomalies, without relying on signatures, statistical training, or labelled traffic, which represents a significant step towards the autonomy of networks. Unsupervised detection is accomplished by means of robust data-clustering techniques, combining Sub-Space clustering with Evidence Accumulation or Inter-Clustering Results Association, to blindly identify anomalies in traffic flows. Correlating the results of the unsupervised detection is also performed for improving the detection robustness. Characterization is achieved by building efficient filtering rules to describe a detected anomaly. The detection and characterization performances of the unsupervised approach are evaluated on real network traffic.","publicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093621/6103944/06104014.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6103944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-Space clustering, Inter-Clustering Results Association & anomaly correlation for unsupervised network anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104014/","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Space clustering, Inter-Clustering Results Association & anomaly correlation for unsupervised network anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441074","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104014/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Space clustering, Inter-Clustering Results Association & anomaly correlation for unsupervised network anomaly detection","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"856951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099924S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093621","isNumber":"6103944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093621","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6103944","articleId":"6104014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6104030,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy N.

One very effective approach to improving processor energy efficiency is to lower its supply voltage to very near to the transistor threshold voltage. This reduces power consumption dramatically, improving energy efficiency by an order of magnitude. Low voltage operation, however, increases the effects of parameter variation resulting in significant frequency heterogeneity between (and within) otherwise identical cores. This heterogeneity severely limits the maximum frequency of the entire CMP. We present a combination of techniques aimed at reducing the effects of variation on the performance and energy efficiency of near-threshold, many-core CMPs. Dual Voltage Rail (DVR), mitigates core-to-core variation with a dual-rail power delivery system that allows post-manufacturing assignment of different supply voltages to individual cores. This speeds up slow cores by assigning them to a higher voltage and saves power on fast cores by assigning them to a lower voltage. Half-Speed Unit (HSU) mitigates within-core variation by halving the frequency of select functional blocks with the goal of boosting the frequency of individual cores, thus raising the frequency ceiling for the entire CMP. Together, these variation-reduction techniques result in almost 50% improvement in CMP performance for the same power consumption over a mix of workloads.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Power demand","Computer architecture","Threshold voltage","Multiprocessing systems","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","microprocessor chips","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process variation effect","ultra-low voltage chip multiprocessors","dual supply voltage","half-speed unit","energy efficiency","microprocessor design","transistor threshold voltage","power consumption","low voltage operation","parameter variation","frequency heterogeneity","dual voltage rail","core-to-core variation","dual-rail power delivery system","supply voltage assignment","within-core variation","CMP frequency ceiling","CMP performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rails","Power demand","Computer architecture","Threshold voltage","Clocks","Delay","Benchmark testing","chip multiprocessors","Energy efficiency","near-threshold voltage","process variation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104030","doi":"10.1109/L-CA.2011.36","startPage":"45","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/10208/6376056/06104030.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/L-CA.2011.36","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104030/","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating the Effects of Process Variation in Ultra-low Voltage Chip Multiprocessors using Dual Supply Voltages and Half-Speed Units","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec.  2012","volume":"11","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13167673","htmlLink":"/document/6104030/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating the Effects of Process Variation in Ultra-low Voltage Chip Multiprocessors using Dual Supply Voltages and Half-Speed Units","sourcePdf":"lca2012020045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085555S","chronDate":"July-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"6376056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6376056","articleId":"6104030","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6104032,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Al-Hmouz","affiliation":["School of Information Systems & Technology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Ahmed Al-Hmouz received the BSc degree in computer science from Mutah University, Jordan, the MSc degree in internet technology, and the MSc degree in information systems from the University of Wollongong, Australia.

The learner model presented in our earlier work was partitioned into smaller elements in the form of learner profiles, which collectively represent the entire learning process. This paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for delivering adapted learning content to mobile learners. The ANFIS model was designed using trial and error based on various experiments. This study was conducted to illustrate that ANFIS is effective with hybrid learning, for the adaptation of learning content according to learners' needs. Study results show that ANFIS has been successfully implemented for learning content adaptation within different learning context scenarios. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated using standard error measurements which revealed the optimal setting necessary for better predictability. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS approach is valuable and easy to implement. The study results are based on analysis of different model settings; they confirm that the m-learning application is functional.

In this model, users negotiate with service providers on their required Quality of Service and on the corresponding price to reach a Service Level Agreement. One of the most challenging problems in utility Grids is workflow scheduling, i.e., the problem of satisfying the QoS of the users as well as minimizing the cost of workflow execution. In this paper, we propose a new QoS-based workflow scheduling algorithm based on a novel concept called Partial Critical Paths (PCP), that tries to minimize the cost of workflow execution while meeting a user-defined deadline. The PCP algorithm has two phases: in the deadline distribution phase it recursively assigns subdeadlines to the tasks on the partial critical paths ending at previously assigned tasks, and in the planning phase it assigns the cheapest service to each task while meeting its subdeadline. The simulation results show that the performance of the PCP algorithm is very promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104035/","volume":"23","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6104035/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12820727","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Driven Scheduling of Grid Workflows Using Partial Critical Paths","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Driven Scheduling of Grid Workflows Using Partial Critical Paths","sourcePdf":"ttd2012081400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.195691S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6227391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"6227391","articleId":"6104035","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6104044,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Shvaiko","affiliation":["TasLab, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Pavel Shvaiko is an innovation and research manager at Informatica Trentina SpA, Italy.

We are particularly interested in the case where CRs with false alarms autonomously select the sensing orders in which they visit channels, without coordination from a centralized entity. We propose an adaptive persistent sensing order selection strategy and show that this strategy converges and reduces the likelihood of collisions among the autonomous CRs as compared to a random selection of sensing orders. We also show that, when the number of CRs is less than or equal to the number of channels, the proposed strategy enables the CRs to converge to collision-free channel sensing orders. The proposed adaptive persistent strategy also reduces the expected time of arrival at collision-free sensing orders as compared to the randomize after every collision strategy, in which a CR, upon colliding, randomly selects a new sensing order.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.257","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6387244/06104049.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"274","endPage":"288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Sensing Order Selection Strategies Exploiting Channel Access Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Sensing Order Selection Strategies Exploiting Channel Access Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104049/","volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6104049/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13189885","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Sensing Order Selection Strategies Exploiting Channel Access Information","sourcePdf":"ttm2013020274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092141S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6387244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6387244","articleId":"6104049","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6104054,"authors":[{"name":"Enyang Xu","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6355922/6104054/6104054-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Enyang Xu received the BE and MS degrees from the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Since the mobile target's maneuver is unknown, the mobile sensor controller utilizes the measurement collected by a wireless sensor network in terms of the mobile target signal's time of arrival (TOA). The mobile sensor controller acquires the TOA measurement information from both the mobile target and the mobile sensor for estimating their locations before directing the mobile sensor's movement to follow the target. We propose a min-max approximation approach to estimate the location for tracking which can be efficiently solved via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, and apply a cubic function for mobile sensor navigation. We estimate the location of the mobile sensor and target jointly to improve the tracking accuracy. To further improve the system performance, we propose a weighted tracking algorithm by using the measurement information more efficiently. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides good tracking performance and can quickly direct the mobile sensor to follow the mobile target.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6355922/06104054.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"186","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target Tracking and Mobile Sensor Navigation in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104054/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Target Tracking and Mobile Sensor Navigation in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/6104054/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136691","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target Tracking and Mobile Sensor Navigation in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013010177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088601S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6355922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6355922","articleId":"6104054","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6104058,"authors":[{"name":"Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou","affiliation":["INRIA, Rennes"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6247420/6104058/6104058-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Rennes, defended in 2005, on joint source channel coding.

Three constraints have to be taken into account: search accuracy, efficiency, and memory usage. We first present and evaluate different ways of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector and show that the Fisher kernel achieves better performance than the reference bag-of-visual words approach for any given vector dimension. We then jointly optimize dimensionality reduction and indexing in order to obtain a precise vector comparison as well as a compact representation. The evaluation shows that the image representation can be reduced to a few dozen bytes while preserving high accuracy. Searching a 100 million image data set takes about 250 ms on one processor core.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","volume":"34","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12944529","pubMedId":"22156101","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6104058/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Aggregating Local Image Descriptors into Compact Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregating Local Image Descriptors into Compact Codes","sourcePdf":"ttp2012091704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095975S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6247420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"901","xplore-issue":"6247420","articleId":"6104058","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6104061,"authors":[{"name":"Zdenek Kalal","affiliation":["Centre for Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6200921/6104061/6104061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zdenek Kalal received the MSc degree in technical cybernetics from the Czech Technical University, Prague, and the PhD degree from the Center of Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, United Kingdom, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

The object is defined by its location and extent in a single frame. In every frame that follows, the task is to determine the object's location and extent or indicate that the object is not present. We propose a novel tracking framework (TLD) that explicitly decomposes the long-term tracking task into tracking, learning, and detection. The tracker follows the object from frame to frame. The detector localizes all appearances that have been observed so far and corrects the tracker if necessary. The learning estimates the detector's errors and updates it to avoid these errors in the future. We study how to identify the detector's errors and learn from them. We develop a novel learning method (P-N learning) which estimates the errors by a pair of \u201cexperts\u201d: (1) P-expert estimates missed detections, and (2) N-expert estimates false alarms. The learning process is modeled as a discrete dynamical system and the conditions under which the learning guarantees improvement are found. We describe our real-time implementation of the TLD framework and the P-N learning. We carry out an extensive quantitative evaluation which shows a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.239","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6200921/06104061.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6200921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking-Learning-Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Tracking-Learning-Detection","volume":"34","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12728261","pubMedId":"22156098","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6104061/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking-Learning-Detection","sourcePdf":"ttp2012071409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146097S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6200921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"2183","xplore-issue":"6200921","articleId":"6104061","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6104064,"authors":[{"name":"Bohyung Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bohyung","lastName":"Han","id":"37279223700"},{"name":"Larry S.

However, there have not been many studies concerning useful features and binary segmentation algorithms for this problem. We propose a pixelwise background modeling and subtraction technique using multiple features, where generative and discriminative techniques are combined for classification. In our algorithm, color, gradient, and Haar-like features are integrated to handle spatio-temporal variations for each pixel. A pixelwise generative background model is obtained for each feature efficiently and effectively by Kernel Density Approximation (KDA). Background subtraction is performed in a discriminative manner using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) over background likelihood vectors for a set of features. The proposed algorithm is robust to shadow, illumination changes, spatial variations of background. We compare the performance of the algorithm with other density-based methods using several different feature combinations and modeling techniques, both quantitatively and qualitatively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12617614","htmlLink":"/document/6104064/","pubMedId":"22156099","displayDocTitle":"Density-Based Multifeature Background Subtraction with Support Vector Machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density-Based Multifeature Background Subtraction with Support Vector Machine","sourcePdf":"ttp2012051017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03878S","chronDate":"May  2012","isNumber":"6171978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"95","articleId":"6104064","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6104083,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Atef","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Mohamed Atef (M'07) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering, electronics and communications from Assiut University, Egypt, in 2000 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in 2010 from the Institute of Electrodynamics, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria.","From 2006 to 2007, he was a Researcher in the Department of Microelectronics, Czech Technical University, Prague, working on the optical prosperities of quantum dots.

Time-to-breakdown (BD) statistics for grain boundary (GB) and grain in a polycrystalline HK gate stack are obtained individually from localized constant voltage stressing via a scanning tunneling microscope. In spite of an initial difference in the preexisting defect density, no apparent difference in the Weibull slope is observed for the two sets of BD statistics. The bimodal Weibull distribution is shown to be a combined effect: 1) The steep Weibull slope of the lower percentile, arising from large-area devices, is related to BD at GBs, and 2) the upper percentile, arising from small-area devices, is mostly related to grain BDs. In this case, the Weibull slope is reduced by a small fraction of these devices exhibiting early failures due to GB BDs. We show directly that structural defects in an HK dielectric, particularly GBs, play an important role on its BD distribution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bimodal Weibull Distribution of Metal/High-- Gate Stack TDDB\u2014Insights by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2011.2174606","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/6138595/06104095.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2011.2174606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6138595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Bimodal Weibull Distribution of Metal/High-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa$ </tex></formula> Gate Stack TDDB\u2014Insights by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6104095/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12489196","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bimodal Weibull Distribution of Metal/High-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa$ </tex></formula> Gate Stack TDDB\u2014Insights by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy","sourcePdf":"led-yew-2174606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128836S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6138595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6138595","articleId":"6104095","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104106,"authors":[{"name":"Anish Mittal","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Mittal","id":"37589021600"},{"name":"Gautam S.

In Part II, we demonstrate the experimental validation of this hybrid design. One-transistor memory cells were fabricated with polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene [P(VDF-TrFE)] as the ferroelectric and HfO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n as the charge trap layer. Hybrid devices showed larger memory window and longer retention time compared to conventional FE-FETs with the same effective oxide thickness. Pulsed measurements were performed on metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors to estimate switching delay in the P(VDF-TrFE) thin film. Field enhancement in the tunnel oxide resulted in pronounced electron injection from the gate compared with gate injection Flash memory cells. Hybrid devices also exhibited higher program efficiencies against the FE-FET due to the contribution from these injected electrons. The presence of the tunnel oxide in hybrid devices showed over 20\u00d7 reduction in gate leakage, which resulted in 100 \u00d7 improvement in cycling endurance against FE-FETs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ferroelectric and Charge Hybrid Nonvolatile Memory\u2014Part II: Experimental Validation and Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2175397","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6135546/06104130.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2175397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6135546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Ferroelectric and Charge Hybrid Nonvolatile Memory\u2014Part II: Experimental Validation and Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6104130/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12487014","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ferroelectric and Charge Hybrid Nonvolatile Memory\u2014Part II: Experimental Validation and Analysis","sourcePdf":"ted-rajwade-2175397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077701S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6135546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6135546","articleId":"6104130","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104141,"authors":[{"name":"Crystal Bertoncini","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington DC, DC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6230687/6104141/6104141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Crystal Bertoncini received the B.A. degree each in physics and mathematics from Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY, in 2005.

Our 3-D visible set is convex even in the presence of uncertainties in intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera, just as the image plane. Then, we can ensure the field of view (FOV) constraint simply by controlling the camera pose to follow a smooth straight-line trajectory in our 3-D visible set for PBVS, which simply connects two points determined by the initial and desired poses of the camera. In fact, this is, to our best knowledge, the first result in PBVS that has guaranteed theoretically robust global stability under the FOV constraint with respect to uncertainties in intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera as well as in the distance between the camera and the object at the desired pose. Furthermore, our PBVS scheme is computationally simple compared to the prior works. To demonstrate further the validity and practicality of our PBVS scheme, we also present various experimental results using a six-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2179270","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6230687/06104142.pdf","startPage":"4735","endPage":"4752","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2179270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6230687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Position-Based Visual Servoing Approach to Robust Global Stability Under Field-of-View Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel Position-Based Visual Servoing Approach to Robust Global Stability Under Field-of-View Constraint","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12834258","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Position-Based Visual Servoing Approach to Robust Global Stability Under Field-of-View Constraint","sourcePdf":"tie-ha-2179270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125085S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6230687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"51","articleId":"6104142","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6104148,"authors":[{"name":"John Y.

Light scattering is caused by light incident on objects reflected and deflected multiple times by particles present in the water before reaching the camera. This in turn lowers the visibility and contrast of the image captured. Color change corresponds to the varying degrees of attenuation encountered by light traveling in the water with different wavelengths, rendering ambient underwater environments dominated by a bluish tone. No existing underwater processing techniques can handle light scattering and color change distortions suffered by underwater images, and the possible presence of artificial lighting simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel systematic approach to enhance underwater images by a dehazing algorithm, to compensate the attenuation discrepancy along the propagation path, and to take the influence of the possible presence of an artifical light source into consideration. Once the depth map, i.e., distances between the objects and the camera, is estimated, the foreground and background within a scene are segmented. The light intensities of foreground and background are compared to determine whether an artificial light source is employed during the image capturing process. After compensating the effect of artifical light, the haze phenomenon and discrepancy in wavelength attenuation along the underwater propagation path to camera are corrected. Next, the water depth in the image scene is estimated according to the residual energy ratios of different color channels existing in the background light. Based on the amount of attenuation corresponding to each light wavelength, color change compensation is conducted to restore color balance. The performance of the proposed algorithm for wavelength compensation and image dehazing (WCID) is evaluated both objectively and subjectively by utilizing ground-truth color patches and video downloaded from the Youtube website. Both results demonstrate that images with significantly enhanced visibility and superior color fidelity are obtained by the WCID proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2179666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2179666","startPage":"1756","endPage":"1769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6170603/06104148.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater Image Enhancement by Wavelength Compensation and Dehazing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Underwater Image Enhancement by Wavelength Compensation and Dehazing","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12615476","pubMedId":"22180510","publicationDate":"April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater Image Enhancement by Wavelength Compensation and Dehazing","sourcePdf":"tip-chiang-2179666-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066211S","chronDate":"April  2012","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"388","articleId":"6104148","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6104150,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6104150/6104150-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Yang (S'09\u2013M'11) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in automatic control from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

Each pixel in the sensor has a binary response, giving only a 1-bit quantized measurement of the local light intensity. To analyze its performance, we formulate the oversampled binary sensing scheme as a parameter estimation problem based on quantized Poisson statistics. We show that, with a single-photon quantization threshold and large oversampling factors, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimation variance approaches that of an ideal unquantized sensor, i.e., as if there were no quantization in the sensor measurements. Furthermore, the CRLB is shown to be asymptotically achievable by the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE). By showing that the log-likelihood function of our problem is concave, we guarantee the global optimality of iterative algorithms in finding the MLE. Numerical results on both synthetic data and images taken by a prototype sensor verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our image reconstruction algorithm.

Manta ray can perform diversified locomotion patterns in water by manipulating two wide tins. These motion patterns have been implemented on the developed fish robot, including swimming by flapping fins, turning by modulating phase relations of fins, and online transition of different motion patterns. The movements are achieved by using a model of artificial central pattern generators (CPGs) constructed with coupled nonlinear oscillators. This paper focuses on the analytical formulation of coupling terms in the CPG model and the implementation issues of the CPG-based control on the fish robot. The control method demonstrated on the manta ray robot is expected to be a frame- work that can tackle locomotion control problems in other types of multifin-actuated fish robots or more general robots with rhythmic movement patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"12471605","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104154/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Locomotion Control of a Biomimetic Underwater Vehicle With Fin Propulsion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Locomotion Control of a Biomimetic Underwater Vehicle With Fin Propulsion","sourcePdf":"tmech-low-2175004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133645S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6126206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"6126206","articleId":"6104154","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6104157,"authors":[{"name":"Silvia Muceli","affiliation":["Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, Bernstein Focus Neurotechnology G\u00f6ttingen, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, University of Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, Georg-August University, Gottingen, Germany","Center for Sensory-Motor Interaction, Department of Health Science and Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6202773/6104157/6104157-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Silvia Muceli (S'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (cum laude) in electronics engineering from the University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

We used artificial neural networks to estimate kinematics of the complex wrist/hand from high-density surface electromyography (EMG) signals of the contralateral limb during mirrored bilateral movements in free space. The movements tested involved the concurrent activation of wrist flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation, forearm pronation/supination, and hand closing. The accuracy in estimation was in the range 79%-88% (r\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n index) for the four DOFs in six able-bodied subjects. Moreover, the estimation of the pronation/supination angle (wrist rotation) was influenced by the reduction in the number of EMG channels used for the estimation to a greater extent than the other DOFs. In conclusion, the proposed method and set-up provide a viable means for proportional and simultaneous control of multiple DOFs for hand prostheses.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/6202773/06104157.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2178039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2178039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6202773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous and Proportional Estimation of Hand Kinematics From EMG During Mirrored Movements at Multiple Degrees-of-Freedom","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Kinematics","Estimation","Wrist","Muscles","Training","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","electromyography","estimation theory","kinematics","motion control","neural nets","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous estimation","proportional estimation","hand kinematics","EMG","multiple degrees-of-freedom","able-bodied subjects","unilateral transradial amputees","artificial neural networks","complex wrist-hand kinematics","high-density surface electromyography","contralateral limb","mirrored bilateral movements","forearm pronation-supination","hand closing","wrist flexion-extension","radial-ulnar deviation","hand prostheses","prosthetic control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Degrees-of-freedom (DOFs)","electromyography","kinematics","prosthetic control"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Analysis of Variance","Biomechanics","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Electrodes","Electromyography","Female","Forearm","Functional Laterality","Hand","Humans","Male","Movement","Muscle Contraction","Muscle Fibers, Skeletal","Muscle, Skeletal","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurons","Principal Component Analysis","Psychomotor Performance","Reproducibility of Results","Wrist","Young Adult"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous and Proportional Estimation of Hand Kinematics From EMG During Mirrored Movements at Multiple Degrees-of-Freedom","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6104157/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12852925","pubMedId":"22180516","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous and Proportional Estimation of Hand Kinematics From EMG During Mirrored Movements at Multiple Degrees-of-Freedom","sourcePdf":"tnsre-farina-2178039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062009S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6202773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"6202773","articleId":"6104157","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104161,"authors":[{"name":"Changjin Liu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6177741/6104161/6104161-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changjin Liu received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2005.

Therefore, wind turbine current controllers need to be designed to eliminate the impact of grid voltage harmonics, especially low-order harmonics. This paper proposes a stator current harmonic suppression method using a sixth-order resonant controller to eliminate negative sequence fifth- and positive sequence seventh-order current harmonics. A stator current harmonic control loop is added to the conventional rotor current control loop for harmonic suppression. The overall control scheme is implemented in dq frame. Based on a mathematical model of the DFIG control system, the effects on system stability using the resonant controller, an analysis of the steady-state error, and the dynamic performance, are discussed in this paper. Taking these effects into account, the parameters of the resonant controller can be designed and effectively damp the influence from the grid voltage harmonics. As a result, the impacts of the negative sequence fifth- and positive sequence seventh-order voltage harmonics on the stator current as well as the electromagnetic torque are effectively removed. Simulations and experiments are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2179561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2179561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177741","startPage":"3207","endPage":"3220","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6177741/06104161.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Stators","Rotors","Voltage control","Power harmonic filters","Harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","electric current control","power grids","power system harmonics","rotors","stators","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly fed induction generator","stator current harmonic control","sixth-order resonant controller","wind turbine system","generated power quality","wind turbine current controllers","grid voltage harmonics","low-order harmonics","stator current harmonic suppression","rotor current control loop","system stability","steady-state error","electromagnetic torque"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current harmonic","control design","distorted voltage","doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)","resonant controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stator Current Harmonic Control With Resonant Controller for Doubly Fed Induction Generator","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12638741","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6104161/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104161/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stator Current Harmonic Control With Resonant Controller for Doubly Fed Induction Generator","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2179561-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083302S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6177741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"6177741","articleId":"6104161","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6104162,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel E.

We consider maximization of the weighted sum rate with per BS antenna power constraint problem. We propose novel centralized and computationally efficient distributed iterative algorithms that achieve local optimum to the latter problem. These algorithms are described as follows. First, by introducing additional optimization variables, we reformulate the original problem into a new problem. Second, for the given precoder matrices of all users, the optimal receivers are computed using minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) method and the optimal introduced variables are obtained in closed form expressions. Third, by keeping the introduced variables and receivers constant, the precoder matrices of all users are optimized by using second-order-cone programming (SOCP) and matrix fractional minimization approaches for the centralized and distributed algorithms, respectively. Finally, the second and third steps are repeated until these algorithms converge. We have shown that the proposed algorithms are guaranteed to converge. We also show that the proposed algorithms require less computational cost than that of the existing linear algorithm. All simulation results demonstrate that our distributed algorithm achieves the same performance as that of the centralized algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithms outperform the existing linear algorithm. In particular, when each of the users has single antenna, we have observed that the proposed algorithms achieve the global optimum.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2179538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06104172.pdf","startPage":"1876","endPage":"1889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2179538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Sum Rate Optimization for Downlink Multiuser MIMO Coordinated Base Station Systems: Centralized and Distributed Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104172/","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Sum Rate Optimization for Downlink Multiuser MIMO Coordinated Base Station Systems: Centralized and Distributed Algorithms","volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12590660","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104172/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Sum Rate Optimization for Downlink Multiuser MIMO Coordinated Base Station Systems: Centralized and Distributed Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tsp-bogale-2179538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173222S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6104172","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104173,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Friedlander","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Friedlander","id":"37268592100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6104173","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1014},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Doppler effect","Delay","Manifolds","Radar","Vectors","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","delays","distortion","Doppler shift","MIMO radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","model mismatch effect","signal model","delay parameters","Doppler parameters","discrete grid","array manifold distortion","array processing functions","beamforming","null steering","direction finding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ambiguity function","array processing","delay","Doppler","MIMO","radar"]}],"abstract":"The current literature on MIMO radar commonly uses a signal model that assumes that the Doppler and delay parameters of the scatterers lie on a discrete grid.

First, we propose an open-loop low-complexity MIMO spatial multiplexing scheme based on the energy spreading transform (EST-SM). The EST-SM can spatially multiplex multiple data streams and iteratively detect the data streams with almost negligible interstream interference at sufficiently high SNR. Then, we propose a closed-loop precoding scheme suitable for the EST-SM called root mean square decomposition (RMSD) scheme. The RMSD precoding scheme combined with the EST-SM decomposes a MIMO channel into multiple subchannels with identical SNRs. This desired property minimizes bit error rate (BER) when different bit allocations on different subchannels, which cause a significant increase in system complexity, are not used. We show that when the EST-SM is used the RMSD scheme is optimal in BER performance and it achieves full diversity. Simulation results show that the RMSD scheme outperforms other existing techniques such as the geometric mean decomposition (GMD) scheme (Jiang , IEEE Trans.

A discrete-time signal model is assumed and practical constant-modulus or low peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR) constraints are imposed on the transmit signal. Several optimization methods are proposed for this joint design. Furthermore, the MSE criterion is expressed in the frequency domain and a corresponding MSE lower bound is derived.

In this work, we utilize this architecture to significantly simplify a transmit procedure in which the covariance matrix across the MIMO radar array is optimized to improve the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) on target parameter estimation. The MIMO effective array for regular subarrayed transmit apertures is studied, and necessary conditions to obtain a filled effective aperture are presented, which is important for maintaining nonambiguous, low sidelobe beampatterns. The performance of the subarrayed transmit approach is evaluated in terms of the CRB on target parameter estimation, and the optimisation of the beamformer applied to the subarrays to minimize the CRB is considered. The subarrayed transmit scheme is found to have a CRB which is suboptimal to the full diversity transmission, as expected, but is solvable in a small fraction of the time using an iterative beamspace algorithm developed here.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On MIMO Radar Subarrayed Transmit Beamforming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2179540","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06104178.pdf","startPage":"2076","endPage":"2081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2179540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"On MIMO Radar Subarrayed Transmit Beamforming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6104178/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12590665","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On MIMO Radar Subarrayed Transmit Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tsp-wilcox-2179540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072975S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6104178","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104179,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Research Center of Machine Learning and Data Analysis, School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6165492/6104179/6104179-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Zhang (M'08) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1997 and 2002, respectively.","From 2003 to 2005, she was a Postdoctor at the Institute of Automation of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

However, SRC could not well classify the data with the same direction distribution. The same direction distribution means that the sample vectors belonging to different classes distribute on the same vector direction. This paper presents a new classifier, kernel sparse representation-based classifier (KSRC), based on SRC and the kernel trick which is a usual technique in machine learning. KSRC is a nonlinear extension of SRC and can remedy the drawback of SRC. To make the data in an input space separable, we implicitly map these data into a high-dimensional kernel feature space by using some nonlinear mapping associated with a kernel function. Since this kernel feature space has a very high (or possibly infinite) dimensionality, or is unknown, we have to avoid working in this space explicitly. Fortunately, we can indeed reduce the dimensionality of the kernel feature space by exploiting kernel-based dimensionality reduction methods. In the reduced subspace, we need to find sparse combination coefficients for a test sample and assign a class label to it. Similar to SRC, KSRC is also cast into an \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization problem or a quadratically constrained \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n -minimization problem.

Upon completion of this initial search, a list of contacts is obtained. The overall classification performance can be significantly improved by revisiting these contacts to collect additional looks. This paper provides, for the first time, a link between the recent literature which finds optimal secondary looks and optimal route planning software. Automated planning algorithms are needed to generate multiaspect routes to improve the performance of mine-hunting systems and increase the capability of navies to efficiently clear potential mine fields. This paper introduces two new numerical techniques designed to enable current remote mine-hunting systems to achieve secondary paths minimizing the total distance to be traveled and satisfying all motion and imaging constraints. The first \"local\" approach is based on a sequential algorithm dealing with more tractable subproblems, while the second is \"global\" and based on simulated annealing. These numerical techniques are applied to two test sites created for the Mongoose sea trial held at the 2007 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Fest, Panama City, FL. Highly satisfactory planning solutions are obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6104186/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471574","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Constrained Search Patterns for Remote Mine-Hunting Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Constrained Search Patterns for Remote Mine-Hunting Vehicles","sourcePdf":"joe-couillard-2173833-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125594S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6126182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6126182","articleId":"6104186","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6104190,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Ling","affiliation":["MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/6126182/6104190/6104190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Ling received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2011.","He is currently with the MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA.

To mitigate ISI, equalizer becomes an indispensable module in the receiver structure. However, the time-varying nature of the underwater acoustic environment imposes unique challenges to the design of an effective equalizer. First, the equalization process needs to be performed on a block basis and the block length could be short. Second, concerning that the dynamic acoustic medium makes the newly acquired channel information readily outdated, it is desirable that the equalizer performance is robust against the inaccuracy of the channel information when the transmission scheme involves cross-block reference. In this paper, we consider a statistical semiblind equalizer implemented by the Gibbs sampler techniques. The proposed equalizer con- ducts channel estimation and symbol detection in a joint manner, and it is robust to the accuracy of the channel information. The effectiveness of the proposed semiblind equalizer is demonstrated using both simulated and the 2008 Surface Processes and Communications Experiment (SPACE08, Martha's Vineyard, MA) in-water experimentation examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2171132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126182","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6126182/06104190.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gibbs-Sampler-Based Semiblind Equalizer in Underwater Acoustic Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6104190/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gibbs-Sampler-Based Semiblind Equalizer in Underwater Acoustic Communications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471578","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gibbs-Sampler-Based Semiblind Equalizer in Underwater Acoustic Communications","sourcePdf":"joe-li-2171132-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105042S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6126182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6126182","articleId":"6104190","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6104207,"authors":[{"name":"Nuwan Perera","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6108459/6104207/6104207-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nuwan Perera (S'06\u2013M'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Currently, he is a Lecturer with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Moratuwa.

In the proposed scheme, a set of Hidden Markov Model-based classifiers is employed to recognize the fault transients. Input features for the classifiers are the energy contained in wavelet coefficients of the measured current waveforms. A laboratory prototype of the fault recognition system was implemented on a floating-point digital-signal-processor (DSP)-based hardware platform. The classification system was tested using the transient signals generated by a real-time waveform playback unit. The test waveforms were generated by simulating an actual extra-high-voltage transmission system on an electromagnetic transient simulation program. The operation of the classification system was further verified using waveforms obtained from an actual fault recorder. The performance of the classifier was investigated under different practical scenarios, such as current transformer saturation, measurement noise, and lightning faults.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2174163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6108459/06104207.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2174163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108459","startPage":"40","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and Hardware Implementation of a Fault Transients Recognition System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development and Hardware Implementation of a Fault Transients Recognition System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425783","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6104207/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and Hardware Implementation of a Fault Transients Recognition System","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-perera-2174163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111143S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6108459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6108459","articleId":"6104207","onlineDate":"13 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104211,"authors":[{"name":"Abhilash Goyal","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6246737/6104211/6104211-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abhilash Goyal (S'09) received the Bachelor of Technology (Honors) degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India, and the Master's and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, (Georgia Tech).","During his Ph.D. at Georgia Tech, he was involved as a mentor for undergraduate research program at the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) School and taught (instructor) ECE3710 course at ECE School.

The hybrid model, known as FMM-CART, exploits the advantages of both FMM and CART for undertaking data classification and rule extraction problems. A series of real experiments is conducted, whereby the motor current signature analysis method is applied to form a database comprising stator current signatures under different motor conditions. The signal harmonics from the power spectral density are extracted as discriminative input features for fault detection and classification with FMM-CART. A comprehensive list of induction motor fault conditions, viz., broken rotor bars, unbalanced voltages, stator winding faults, and eccentricity problems, has been successfully classified using FMM-CART with good accuracy rates. The results are comparable, if not better, than those reported in the literature. Useful explanatory rules in the form of a decision tree are also elicited from FMM-CART to analyze and understand different fault conditions of induction motors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6119090/06104222.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Induction Motors Using Motor Current Signature Analysis and a Hybrid FMM\u2013CART Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Stator windings","Rotors","Fault detection","Feature extraction","Bars"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","electric machine analysis computing","fault diagnosis","fuzzy set theory","induction motors","minimax techniques","neural nets","pattern classification","regression analysis","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection","fault diagnosis","induction motors","motor current signature analysis","hybrid FMM-CART model","hybrid fuzzy min-max neural network","classification and regression tree","data classification","rule extraction problems","stator current signatures","signal harmonics","spectral density","discriminative input feature extraction","broken rotor bars","unbalanced voltages","stator winding faults","eccentricity problems","decision tree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification and regression tree","fault detection and diagnosis","fuzzy min\u2013max neural network","induction motor","motor current signature analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Induction Motors Using Motor Current Signature Analysis and a Hybrid FMM\u2013CART Model","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6104222/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12438085","pubMedId":"24808459","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Induction Motors Using Motor Current Signature Analysis and a Hybrid FMM\u2013CART Model","sourcePdf":"tnnls-lim-2178443-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116075S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6119090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6119090","articleId":"6104222","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6104223,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Lopez-Echeverria","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6119090/6104223/6104223-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel L\u00f3pez-Echeverr\u00eda received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Quer\u00e9taro Institute of Technology, Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico, in 1995, the M.S. degree in advanced technology from the Research Center for Applied Science and Advanced Technology, National Polytechnic Institute, Quer\u00e9taro, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oregon State University, Corvallis, in 2011.","His current research interests include control algorithms, computer-controlled systems, networked control systems, and neural network applications in control."]},"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Lopez-Echeverria","id":"38280522400"},{"name":"Mario E.

It is well known that time delays and external disturbances can derail the stability of RNNs. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of global stability of RNNs subject to time delays and random disturbances. Given a globally exponentially stable neural network, the problem to be addressed here is how much time delay and noise the RNN can withstand to be globally exponentially stable in the presence of delay and noise. The upper bounds of the time delay and noise intensity are characterized by using transcendental equations for the RNNs to sustain global exponential stability. Moreover, we prove theoretically that, for any globally exponentially stable RNNs, if additive noises and time delays are smaller than the derived lower bounds arrived at here, then the perturbed RNNs are guaranteed to also be globally exponentially stable. Three numerical examples are provided to substantiate the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178326","startPage":"87","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119090","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6119090/06104229.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness Analysis of Global Exponential Stability of Recurrent Neural Networks in the Presence of Time Delays and Random Disturbances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104229/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robustness Analysis of Global Exponential Stability of Recurrent Neural Networks in the Presence of Time Delays and Random Disturbances","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6104229/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12438091","pubMedId":"24808458","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness Analysis of Global Exponential Stability of Recurrent Neural Networks in the Presence of Time Delays and Random Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wang-2178326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074739S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6119090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6119090","articleId":"6104229","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6104231,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng-Guang Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6145493/6104231/6104231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zheng-Guang Wu was born in 1982.

Based on these criteria, several delay-dependent sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the dissipativity of static NNs with time delay. All the given results in this paper are not only dependent upon the time delay but also upon the number of delay partitions. Some examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and reduced conservatism of the proposed results.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6145493/06104231.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178563","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178563","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104231","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Delay","Delay effects","Stability criteria","Symmetric matrices","Asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","neural nets","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","dissipativity analysis","static neural networks","time delay","time-varying delay","time-invariant delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dissipativity","stability","static neural networks","time delay"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Time Factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Stability and Dissipativity Analysis of Static Neural Networks With Time Delay","accessionNumber":"12509363","pubMedId":"24808500","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6104231/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and Dissipativity Analysis of Static Neural Networks With Time Delay","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wu-2178563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101103S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6145493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"6145493","articleId":"6104231","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":6104232,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Kong","affiliation":["Research Institute of High Technology, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6145493/6104232/6104232-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangyu Kong was born in Shanxi, China, on May 18, 1967.

These unified algorithms can be used to extract principal components and, if altered simply by the sign, can also serve as a minor component extractor. This is of practical significance in the implementations of algorithms. This paper proposes a unified self-stabilizing neural network learning algorithm for principal and minor components extraction, and studies the stability of the proposed unified algorithm via the fixed-point analysis method. The proposed unified self-stabilizing algorithm for principal and minor components extraction is extended for tracking the principal subspace (PS) and minor subspace (MS). The averaging differential equation and the energy function associated with the unified algorithm for tracking PS and MS are given. It is shown that the averaging differential equation will globally asymptotically converge to an invariance set, and the corresponding energy function exhibit a unique global minimum attained if and only if its state matrices span the PS or MS of the autocorrelation matrix of a vector data stream. It is concluded that the proposed unified algorithm for tracking PS and MS can efficiently track an orthonormal basis of the PS or MS. Simulations are carried out to further illustrate the theoretical results achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178564","startPage":"185","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145493","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6145493/06104232.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Self-Stabilizing Neural Network Algorithm for Principal and Minor Components Extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104232/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Unified Self-Stabilizing Neural Network Algorithm for Principal and Minor Components Extraction","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6104232/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12509364","pubMedId":"24808499","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Self-Stabilizing Neural Network Algorithm for Principal and Minor Components Extraction","sourcePdf":"tnnls-xiangyu-2178564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138307S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6145493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6145493","articleId":"6104232","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104342,"authors":[{"name":"Xuezhe Zheng","affiliation":["Oracle Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xuezhe Zheng (M'03\u2013SM'03) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in optical instruments from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1993 and 1997, respectively.","He is currently a Consulting Hardware Engineer with Oracle Labs, San Diego, CA.

This is especially true when considering that the memristive functionality is not limited to two-terminal devices, whose practical realization has been demonstrated within a broad range of different technologies. For electron devices, the memristive functionality can be generally attributed to a material state modification, whose dynamics can be engineered to target a specific application. In this review paper, we show that trap charging dynamics can explain some of the memristive effects previously reported for Schottky-barrier field-effect Si nanowire transistors (SB SiNW FETs). Moreover, the SB SiNW FETs do show additional memristive functionality due to trap charging at the metal/semiconductor surface. The combination of these two memristive effects into multiterminal metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices gives rise to new opportunities for both memory and logic applications as well as new sensors based on the physical mechanism that originate memristance. In the special case of four-terminal memristive Si nanowire devices, which are presented for the first time in this paper, enhanced functionality is demonstrated. Finally, the multiterminal memristive devices presented here have the potential of a very high integration density, and they are suitable for hybrid complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cofabrication with a CMOS-compatible process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104344/","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12713342","volume":"100","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiterminal Memristive Nanowire Devices for Logic and Memory Applications: A Review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiterminal Memristive Nanowire Devices for Logic and Memory Applications: A Review","sourcePdf":"jproc-sacchetto-2172569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139192S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6198299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6198299","articleId":"6104344","onlineDate":"14 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6104356,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Wei Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jin-Wei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37275091400"},{"name":"Feng-Ming Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Feng-Ming","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37304414800"},{"name":"John E.

With the control signal, intermittent operation of key building blocks such as a VCO in the transmitter and a wideband FM demodulator in the receiver is realized. To enable an effective dynamic power control, the transmitter generates higher subcarrier frequency and modulation index than conventional FM-UWB transmitters by utilizing an 8-modulo fractional-N PLL in which a triangular waveform is generated by a relaxation VCO. In the receiver, an envelope detector monitors the presence of incoming signal and enables the data-edge-triggered power control for a wideband FM demodulator and other blocks. A prototype 3.5-4.1 GHz FM-UWB transceiver for on-chip wireline testing is implemented in 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS. Experimental results show that the proposed gated FM-UWB system successfully demodulates the FSK information, achieving nearly 53% power saving with the data-driven power control enabled.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2011","volume":"59","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"12761296","publicationDate":"June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104400/","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Gated FM-UWB System With Data-Driven Front-End Power Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Gated FM-UWB System With Data-Driven Front-End Power Control","sourcePdf":"tcsi-rhee-2173401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100791S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6204215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6204215","articleId":"6104400","onlineDate":"14 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104401,"authors":[{"name":"Yung Sern Tan","affiliation":["VIRTUS, an IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6204215/6104401/6104401-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yung Sern Tan received the B.E.

The proposed PD not only reduces the complexity of the circuit structure but also employs an UP pulse-widening technique to circumvent the problem of existing narrow UP pulses. Meanwhile, it has the least number of output signals among all the other linear PDs with UP pulse-widening technique. It also provides a data recovery circuit to de-multiplex the input data with no systematic phase offset. An unbalanced charge pump (CP) is also proposed to compensate the unbalanced pulse-width of UP and DN pulses as well as the unequal number of signal between UP and DN pulses. A detailed propagation delay analysis and a set of equations to predict the characteristic curve of the proposed PD is given. In addition, a lock detector with hysteresis property is implemented to ensure proper switching of the loops. Fabricated in 0.18- \u03bcm CMOS technology, the circuit shows that the peak-to-peak jitter of the recovered clock is 30.4-ps and it consumes 71.9-mW from a 1.8 V supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6104401/","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761297","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Loop Clock and Data Recovery Circuit With Compact Quarter-Rate CMOS Linear Phase Detector","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Loop Clock and Data Recovery Circuit With Compact Quarter-Rate CMOS Linear Phase Detector","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tan-2173387-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074065S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6204215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6204215","articleId":"6104401","onlineDate":"14 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6104403,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Studer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA","Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Christoph Studer (S'06\u2013M'10) was born in Solothurn, Switzerland on December 25, 1979.

First, a relationship between the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a uniformly sampled sequence and the DFT of a nonuniformly sampled sequence is obtained. From the relationship, the formula to reconstruct the DFT of a uniformly sampled sequence from the DFT of a nonuniformly sampled sequence is derived when the nonuniform sampling ratios are known. Second, a symmetric extension of the nonuniformly sampled sequence is described to avoid discontinuity that adds high-frequency content in the DFT. Finally, experimental results are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Nonuniform sampling","Equations","Image reconstruction","Indexes","Transient analysis","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniformly sampled sequence reconstruction","nonuniformly sampled transient sequence","symmetric extension","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","nonuniform sampling ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","nonuniform sampling","symmetric extension","uniform sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2177834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6146821/06104416.pdf","startPage":"1498","endPage":"1501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2177834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of Uniformly Sampled Sequence From Nonuniformly Sampled Transient Sequence Using Symmetric Extension","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of Uniformly Sampled Sequence From Nonuniformly Sampled Transient Sequence Using Symmetric Extension","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104416/","volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104416/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12527150","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of Uniformly Sampled Sequence From Nonuniformly Sampled Transient Sequence Using Symmetric Extension","sourcePdf":"tsp-park-2177834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047509S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6146821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6146821","articleId":"6104416","onlineDate":"14 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6104418,"authors":[{"name":"Charilaos C.

Recent research in resource management for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) systems has generally assumed the availability of perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) or imperfect CSIT with small uncertainty. Nevertheless, such approaches deliver resource scheduling strategies with high transmitting power because, in real environments, large channel feedback delays and estimation errors cause high CSIT imperfectness. Furthermore, most existing works treat various QoS requirements from mobile users as homogenous, although they are heterogeneous in nature. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a new power-efficient adaptive error-tolerant cross-layer scheduling scheme for OFDMA systems (PE-AETS). Our target is to minimize the transmitting power by considering heterogeneous QoS requirements and data outage due to imperfect CSIT. The proposed scheme adopts a robust power-bit loading (PBL) method that adjusts power and data rates across subcarriers with increased system resilience to channel errors. We develop a statistical queuing model to express the delay limitation of each user with an equivalent cross-layer constraint, and we apply subcarrier time-sharing relaxation to formulate a convex optimization problem. Finally, we utilize Lagrangian optimization to propose a joint power and subcarrier allocation policy with guaranteed convergence to optimal solutions and linear complexity. Various simulation scenarios confirm the superior performance of the proposed PE-AETS over relevant cross-layer approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient Cross-Layer Design for OFDMA Systems With Heterogeneous QoS, Imperfect CSI, and Outage Considerations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2179817","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06104418.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2179817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient Cross-Layer Design for OFDMA Systems With Heterogeneous QoS, Imperfect CSI, and Outage Considerations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6104418/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12527194","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Efficient Cross-Layer Design for OFDMA Systems With Heterogeneous QoS, Imperfect CSI, and Outage Considerations","sourcePdf":"tvt-ni-2179817-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117067S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6104418","onlineDate":"14 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6104424,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel L.

Their usage in critical systems for radiation environments, however, still depends on techniques able to provide increased reliability, since such devices are susceptible to single event upsets that may alter the specified functionality. Classical approaches such as duplication with comparison and triple modular redundancy are powerful in terms of fault detection and/or correction capabilities, and can be easily applied to a variety of circuits, but come with heavy area overheads. In this work we propose a parity-based concurrent error detection technique able to provide single error detection for combinational logic in FPGAs with reduced area when compared to the classical approaches. The proposed technique is automatically applied to a set of benchmark circuits and presents an average area reduction of 24.4% when compared to duplication with comparison, with no performance overhead.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2011.27","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104273/6104423/06104424.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2011.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Area Effective Parity-Based Fault Detection Technique for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104424/","displayDocTitle":"An Area Effective Parity-Based Fault Detection Technique for FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104424/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440421","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Area Effective Parity-Based Fault Detection Technique for FPGAs","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4556a027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063726S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104273","isNumber":"6104423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104273","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6104423","articleId":"6104424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6104425,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiana Bolchini","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristiana","lastName":"Bolchini","id":"37273944700"},{"name":"Chiara Sandionigi","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Sandionigi","id":"37540404700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1713-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"6104425","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reliability-Aware Partitioner for Multi-FPGA Platforms","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104273/6104423/06104425.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2011.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104423","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2011.20","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Wires","Circuit faults","Integrated circuit modeling","Reliability","Topology","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integer programming","linear programming","logic partitioning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability-aware partitioner","multi-FPGA platforms","partitioning approach","reliable systems","mixed integer linear programming model","self-checking","independently recoverable areas","inter-FPGA communication","recovery actions","partitioning problem","heuristic algorithms","global optimal solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-FPGA","Partitioning","Reliability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104425","abstract":"This paper presents a partitioning approach for reliable systems on multi-FPGA platforms.

However, scaling also exacerbates noise and reliability issues, thus posing new challenges in circuit design. Reliability becomes a major concern due to many and often correlated factors, such as parameter variations and soft errors. Existing reliability evaluation tools focus on algorithmic development at the logic level that usually uses a constant error rate for gate failure and thus leads to approximations in the assessment of a VLSI circuit. This paper proposes a more accurate and scalable approach that utilizes a transistor-level stochastic analysis for digital fault modeling. It accounts for very detailed measures, including the probability of failure of individual transistors, the topology of logic gates, timing sequences and the applied input vectors. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate both the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2011.23","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104273/6104423/06104428.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2011.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Transistor-Level Stochastic Approach for Evaluating the Reliability of Digital Nanometric CMOS Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Transistor-Level Stochastic Approach for Evaluating the Reliability of Digital Nanometric CMOS Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6104428/","accessionNumber":"12440425","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Transistor-Level Stochastic Approach for Evaluating the Reliability of Digital Nanometric CMOS Circuits","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4556a060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064707S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104273","isNumber":"6104423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104273","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6104423","articleId":"6104428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6104442,"authors":[{"name":"Glenn H.

Micro fluidic sensors involve sealed channels through which the sample fluid containing biomedical materials flows with capacitive or photonic sensors detecting parameters contained in the liquid. However micro fluidic devices are prone to faults occurring when foreign particles in the bioliquid, or fluid bubbles, get lodged in the paths blocking a channel, thereby changing the fluidic flow in the device and affecting the parameters to be sensed. Thus, these systems require defect tolerant design in the micro fluidic and knowledge of how these changes will affect the parameters being sensed. To achieve fault tolerance we investigate a Cathedral Chamber design, with pillars supporting the roof at regular intervals. This prevents single blockages from stopping fluid flow through the system in a channel, as there are many paths. We discuss the potential causes and effects of such blockages. Monte Carlo analysis and simulations based on both randomly placed blockages and blockages occurring in low flow areas show that the Cathedral Chamber design significantly increases lifetime of the system, an average of 6 times more particles are required before full blockage occurs compared to an array of parallel channels. Fluid flow modeling shows parallel channels show rapid rise of pressure with the number of blockages while the Cathedral chamber shows much slower rise, which reaches a plateau pressure until it is blocked. The impact of these defects on the sensed parameters, such as capacitive measurement of the fluid or photonic measurements, is discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Creating Defect Tolerance in Microfluidic Capacitive/Photonic Biosensors","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2011.33","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104273/6104423/06104442.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2011.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Creating Defect Tolerance in Microfluidic Capacitive/Photonic Biosensors","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104442/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440439","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Creating Defect Tolerance in Microfluidic Capacitive/Photonic Biosensors","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4556a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060057S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104273","isNumber":"6104423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104273","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6104423","articleId":"6104442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6104453,"authors":[{"name":"Amlan Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Amlan","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37544479300"},{"name":"Partha Pande","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, USA"],"firstName":"Partha","lastName":"Pande","id":"37282777300"},{"name":"Benjamin Belzer","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Belzer","id":"37317007300"},{"name":"Alireza Nojeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Nojeh","id":"37391507600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1713-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"6104453","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"abstract":"Hybrid wireless Network-on-Chip (NoC) has emerged as an alternative to the traditional multi-hop wire line NoC to achieve higher performance and low energy dissipation in on-chip data transfer.

In this paper, for the first time, we propose a high-performance scheme for fault detection of the SHA-3 round-three candidate Grostl which is inspired by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). We propose a low-overhead fault detection scheme by presenting closed formulations for the predicted signatures of different transformations of this SHA-3 third-round finalist. These signatures are derived to achieve low overhead and include one or multi-bit parities and byte/word-wide predicted signatures. The proposed reliable hardware architectures for Grostl are implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA family to benchmark their hardware and timing characteristics.

In order to reduce time-to-market, it is crucial to verify the correctness of the hardware and software implementations and the overall system performance at early stages of the design flow with respect to specifications or a higher-level model. To this purpose, we identify some specific requirements of these systems, and propose a new methodology for early validation and BER characterization taking into consideration channel noise and sampling frequency offset of the digital base band communication subsystems. The proposed methodology is based on a low-cost FPGA platform and enables precise control of noise injection and clocking parameters during emulation, so as to reproduce channel and receiver non-ideality effects, while accelerating the validation process by orders of magnitude with respect to simulation-based alternatives. Experimental results on an industrial case consisting of the digital base band portion of an ultra-wideband wireless link confirm the effectiveness of the approach.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104273/6104423/06104467.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2011.1","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2011.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Emulation-Based Platform for Characterization of Digital Baseband Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Emulation-Based Platform for Characterization of Digital Baseband Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104467/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6104467/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440464","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Emulation-Based Platform for Characterization of Digital Baseband Communication Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4556a391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080147S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104273","isNumber":"6104423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104273","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6104423","articleId":"6104467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6104469,"authors":[{"name":"Glenn H.

Based on measurements of defect rates in 23 DSLRs, 4 point and shoot cameras, and 11 cell phone cameras, we show that the rate of these defects depends on the technology (APS or CCD) and on design parameters the like of imager area, pixel size, and gain (ISO). Increasing the image sensitivity (ISO) (from 400 up to 25,600 ISO range) causes the defects to be more noticeable, with some going into saturation, and at the same time increases the number of defects. Partially stuck hot pixels, which have an offset independent of exposure time, make up more than 40% of the defects and are particularly affected by ISO changes. Comparing different sensor sizes has shown that if the pixel size is nearly constant, the defect rate scales linearly with sensor area, suggesting a measurement metric of defects/year/sq mm. Plotting this rate for different pixel and sensor sizes (from 7.5 down to 1.5 microns) shows that defect rates grow rapidly as the pixel size shrinks. Curve fitting shows an empirical power law with defect rate proportional to the pixel size to the power of-2.5. However, separating the pixel types shows that CCDs scale more slowly, with a power of-2, which translates into the pixel area. CMOS sensors, on the other hand, scale more rapidly with the pixel size to the power of-3.3. The result is that for 6-7 micron pixels the CCD defect rate is ~2.5 greater than the CMOS, but for 2 micron pixels the defect rates are both much higher and about equal. This paper presents a formula for predicting the expected rate of defect development for a given set of sensor parameters. This formula can be used by sensor designers when determining the imager parameters, taking into account the length of time the imager is expected to be in service.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Pixel Defect Rates Based on Image Sensor Parameters","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2011.58","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104273/6104423/06104469.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2011.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Pixel Defect Rates Based on Image Sensor Parameters","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104469/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440466","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Pixel Defect Rates Based on Image Sensor Parameters","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4556a408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085961S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104273","isNumber":"6104423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104273","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6104423","articleId":"6104469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6104493,"authors":[{"name":"Taniro Rodrigues","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil"],"firstName":"Taniro","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37602301500"},{"name":"Priscilla Dantas","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil"],"firstName":"Priscilla","lastName":"Dantas","id":"37596066700"},{"name":"Fl\u00b4via C.

These adders show different operational profiles, some of them are inspired by biological networks or the probabilistic nature of nanometric devices (such as the Lower-part OR Adder (LOA) and the Probabilistic Full Adder (PFA)). This paper deals with the reliability assessment and comparison of these sequential adder implementations. A new metric referred to as the mean error distance (MED) is proposed as a unified figure for evaluating the reliability of both probabilistic and deterministic adders. Reliability is analyzed using the so-called sequential probability transition matrices (S-PTMs) with respect also to error masking (as occurring due to the sequential nature of the addition process). A baseline sequential adder implementation, referred to as the Lower-bit Ignored Adder (LIA), is used as a benchmark for evaluating the other implementations. It is shown that compared with the LIA, the PFA has a better reliability at a small gate error rate, but at the cost of a larger overhead in area and therefore static power consumption. The LOA achieves a good tradeoff between reliability, area, power and delay compared to the LIA and PFA implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Probabilistic logic","Measurement","Sequential circuits","Vectors","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","electronic engineering computing","integrated circuit reliability","logic design","matrix algebra","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential adder","soft computing","biological network","nanometric device","lower-part OR ader","LOA","probabilistic full adder","PFA","reliability assessment","mean error distance","MED","deterministic adder","sequential probability transition matrix","S-PTM","error masking","lower-bit ignored adder","LIA","static power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequential adders","Soft computing","Reliability","Error masking","Approximate logic","Imprecise arithmetic","Mean error distance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104503","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2011.54","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104273/6104423/06104503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2011.54","startPage":"3","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104423","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Reliable Performance of Sequential Adders for Soft Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Reliable Performance of Sequential Adders for Soft Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104503/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104503/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440475","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Reliable Performance of Sequential Adders for Soft Computing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4556a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046666S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104273","isNumber":"6104423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104273","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6104423","articleId":"6104503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6104505,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Rossi","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37273952600"},{"name":"Martin Oma\u00f1a","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Oma\u00f1a","id":"37273956700"},{"name":"Cecilia Metra","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Cecilia","lastName":"Metra","id":"37279994900"},{"name":"Alessandro Paccagnella","affiliation":["DEI, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Paccagnella","id":"37268172700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1713-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"6104505","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"abstract":"In this paper we address the issue of analyzing the effects of negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) on ICs' soft error susceptibility.

Therefore, as an IC ages, the soft-error susceptibility of its combinational parts will increase much more than that of its sequential parts.

Most of the currently available wireless multimedia sensor nodes are equipped with ARM7 core micro-controllers [2]. On the other hand, ARM9 core is a viable alternative, which delivers deterministic high performance and flexibility for demanding and cost-sensitive embedded applications. Thus, we evaluated the performance of the ARM7 core against the ARM9 core in terms of processing power and energy consumption.

However, dynamic business motivates modifying existed ontology according to the continuous changes, which is hard to be done manually due to the growing size of ontology. Thus automatic method is needed for ontology evolution. In this paper, an instance-driven ontology evolution approach is proposed to cope with the dynamic changes in ontology evolution. The proposed approach suggests changing directions to users to control the process of evolution. Then the changes of ontology are formalized with elementary and composite changes which are considered as the basis of evolution. Moreover, the identification of changes is realized by instances analyzing. Finally, the approach is tested in a hospital database. The result shows instance-driven ontology evolution is an efficient method to cope with data conception changes in enterprise data management.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 8th International Conference on e-Business Engineering","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","doi":"10.1109/ICEBE.2011.52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEBE.2011.52","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104289/6104584/06104592.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 8th International Conference on e-Business Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instance-Driven Ontology Evolution Mechanism towards Enterprise Data Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104592/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Instance-Driven Ontology Evolution Mechanism towards Enterprise Data Management","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440483","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104592/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instance-Driven Ontology Evolution Mechanism towards Enterprise Data Management","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4518a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045419S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104289","isNumber":"6104584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104289","xplore-issue":"6104584","articleId":"6104592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6104601,"authors":[{"name":"Wigrai Thanadechteemapat","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Australia"],"firstName":"Wigrai","lastName":"Thanadechteemapat","id":"37548058500"},{"name":"Chun Che Fung","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Australia"],"firstName":"Chun Che","lastName":"Fung","id":"37396285700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1404-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4518-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6104601","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web pages","Feature extraction","Tag clouds","Accuracy","Noise","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","information retrieval","Web sites","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic Web content extraction","tag clouds","Thai Web sites","heuristic rules","XPath utility","XML","Web visualization","features extraction","block detection","content extraction selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Content Extraction","XPath","Tag clouds"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel Web content extraction approach based on heuristic rules and the XPath utility in XML.

The paper will focus specifically around cloud deployment and data storage, in particular relation to privacy concerns due to multi-tenancy. The reason for this lies with the identification of Software as a Service (SaaS) as the most likely adopted service model, particularly for those who are teleworking, as this relies on the service provider adopting a multi-tenancy environment within the data centre. The paper takes the perspective that, for both legal reasons and as part of shared obligation, it is necessary for users to recognise the need for common standards of policy and procedure. For example, this may be in levels of protection to prevent data protection and privacy laws being compromised. Both cloud service providers and legislative bodies need to acknowledge the impact that multi-tenancy can have on user privacy and act accordingly in regulatory steps and in encouraging a culture of adhering to common user standards. Such matters must be addressed at the earliest levels of growth in user demand to be optimally effective, especially when scalability is a fundamental driver for the adoption of cloud computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 8th International Conference on e-Business Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104289/6104584/06104607.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 8th International Conference on e-Business Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICEBE.2011.68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEBE.2011.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Complexity Surrounding Multitenancy in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Data privacy","Encryption","Teleworking","Business","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","multi tenancy issues","software as a service","data storage","data protection","data privacy laws"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-tenancy","SaaS","teleworking","Security","Scalability","Data Protection and Privacy Laws"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6104607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Complexity Surrounding Multitenancy in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6104607/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12440498","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Complexity Surrounding Multitenancy in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4518a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059192S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104289","isNumber":"6104584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104289","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6104584","articleId":"6104607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6104631,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Ching Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ching","lastName":"Su","id":"38238057900"},{"name":"Kuo-Lung Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Lung","lastName":"Lian","id":"37541893500"},{"name":"Hsueh-Hsien Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Jinwen University of Science and Technology, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsueh-Hsien","lastName":"Chang","id":"37406779700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1404-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4518-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6104631","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":826},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Monitoring","Induction motors","Steady-state","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","power meters","power system measurement","reactive power","SCADA systems","time-frequency analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonintrusive load monitoring system","feature selection","STFT","wavelet transform","smart meter","power consumption","short-time Fourier transform","time-frequency domain","transient analysis","power signatures","load recognition","reactive power","active power","SCADA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-intrusive load monitoring","signature selection","wavelet transform","short-time Fourier transform"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a concept of non-intrusive load monitoring system for smart meter to monitor the situation of loads.

The key innovation in our work includes (i) a novel metric, word mean squared error, to measure the reliability of a SRAM word when different bits are not equally significant and (ii) an optimization algorithm based on dynamic programming to construct the UEPECC that assigns different protection levels to bits according to their significance. The advantage of the UEPECC over the traditional equal-error-protection ECC is demonstrated using two representative multimedia applications. For the same area, power, and encoding/decoding latency, SRAMs with UEPECC increase the peak signal-to-noise ratio by 8 dB in image processing and incur 60% less errors on average in optical flow (motion vector) computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437549","htmlLink":"/document/6105300/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unequal-error-protection codes in SRAMs for mobile multimedia applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal-error-protection codes in SRAMs for mobile multimedia applications","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00401B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096283S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6105301,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404169700"},{"name":"Hao-Yu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Yu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37596724500"},{"name":"Chin-Yuan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Yuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"38241044100"},{"name":"Hung-Hsin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Hsin","lastName":"Chen","id":"38009886500"},{"name":"Mango C.-T.

Considering a multiple-sleep state model, an application-aware power management scheme is employed to reduce the leakage energy of the on-chip memory. The knowledge of motion and disparity estimation algorithm in conjunction with video properties are considered to predict the memory requirements of each Macroblock. A cost function is evaluated to determine an appropriate sleep mode for the idle memory sectors, while considering the wakeup overhead (latency and energy). The complete motion and disparity estimation architecture is implemented in a 65nm low power IBM technology. The experiments (for various test video sequences) demonstrate that our architecture provides up to 80% leakage energy reduction compared to state-of-the-art.

While initial adapters of the technology have been from image processing domain due to difficulties in programming the GPUs, research on programming languages made it possible for people without the knowledge of low-level programming languages such as OpenGL develop code on GPUs. Two main GPU architectures from AMD (former ATI) and NVIDIA acquired grounds. AMD adapted Stanford's Brook language and made it into an architecture-agnostic programming model. NVIDIA, on the other hand, brought CUDA framework to a wide audience. While the two languages have their pros and cons, such as Brook not being able to scale as well and CUDA having to account for architectural-level decisions, it has not been possible to compile one code on another architecture or across platforms. Another opportunity came with the introduction of the idea of combining one or more CPUs and GPUs on the same die. Eliminating some of the interconnection bandwidth issues, this combination makes it possible to offload tasks with high parallelism to the GPU. The technological direction towards multicores for CPU-only architectures also require a programming methodology change and act as a catalyst for suitable programming languages. Hence, a unified language that can be used both on multiple core CPUs as well as GPUs and their combinations has gained interest. Open Computing Language (OpenCL), developed originally by the Khronos Group of Apple and supported by both AMD and NVIDIA, is seen as the programming language of choice for parallel programming. In this paper, we provide a motivation for our tutorial talk on usage of OpenCL for GPUs and highlight key features of the language. We provide research directions on OpenCL for EDA. In our tutorial talk, we use EDA as our application domain to get the readers started with programming the rising language of parallelism, OpenCL.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105306/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12437555","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105306/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"GPU programming for EDA with OpenCL","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU programming for EDA with OpenCL","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01401T1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047843S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6105307,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Chul Kim","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Myung-Chul","lastName":"Kim","id":"37597329100"},{"name":"Jin Hu","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Hu","id":"38238922200"},{"name":"Dong-Jin Lee","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dong-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406583200"},{"name":"Igor L.

In detailed placement, we use a combination of two kinds of strategy: the traditional HPWL-driven approach and our new congestion-driven approach. Experimental results show that Ripple is very effective in improving routability. Comparing with our pervious placer, which is the winner in the ISPD 2011 Contest, Ripple can further improve the overflow by 38% while reduce the runtime is reduced by 54%.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105308","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095474/6105287/06105308.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105287","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ripple: An effective routability-driven placer by iterative cell movement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6105308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ripple: An effective routability-driven placer by iterative cell movement","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105308/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437557","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6105308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ripple: An effective routability-driven placer by iterative cell movement","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01602A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060563S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6105309,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Kai Hsu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Kai","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37593807900"},{"name":"Sheng Chou","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chou","id":"38236961100"},{"name":"Tzu-Hen Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Hen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37066522300"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279580700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1400-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1399-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1398-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"6105309","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":990},"abstract":"Due to the significant mismatch between existing wirelength models and the congestion objective in placement, considering routability during placement is particularly significant for modern circuit designs. In this paper, a novel routability-driven analytical placement algorithm for large-scale mixed-size circuit designs is proposed. Unlike most existing works which usually optimize routability by reallocating whitespace or net-based congestion removal, the proposed algorithm optimizes routability from three major aspects: (1) Pin density: Most existing works optimize routability based on net distribution, while our work considers both the density of pins and their routing directions; (2) Routing overflow optimization: Unlike most previous works that use white space allocation or net-based congestion removal to improve routability, our work optimizes routing overflow by a novel sigmoid function during global placement; (3) Macro porosity consideration: A virtual macro expansion technique is applied to consider the constrained routing resource incurred by big macros. Routability-driven legalization and detailed placement are also proposed to further optimize routing congestion. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Compared with the participating teams for the 2011 ACM ISPD Routability-Driven Placement Contest, our algorithm achieves the best average overflow and routed wirelength.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design

and characterizing process variation effects on delay and power is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present two embedded test structures (ETS) for carrying out path delay measurement in actual product designs. Of the two structures proposed here, one is designed to be incorporated into a customer's scan structures, augmenting selected functional units with the ability to perform accurate path delay measurements. We refer to this ETS as REBEL (regional delay behavior). It is designed to leverage the existing scan chain as a means of reducing area overhead and performance impact. For cases in which very high resolution of delay measurements is required, a second standalone structure is proposed which we refer to as TDC for time-to-digital converter. Beyond characterizing process variations, these ETSs can also be used for design debug, detection of hardware Trojans and small delay defects and as physical unclonable functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105322/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12437571","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105322/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"REBEL and TDC: Two embedded test structures for on-chip measurements of within-die path delay variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REBEL and TDC: Two embedded test structures for on-chip measurements of within-die path delay variations","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03003A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080765S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6105332,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Huai","affiliation":["Avalanche Technology, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Huai","id":"37312366900"},{"name":"Yuchen Zhou","affiliation":["Avalanche Technology, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuchen","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38236967900"},{"name":"Ioan Tudosa","affiliation":["Avalanche Technology, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Tudosa","id":"37395120800"},{"name":"Roger Malmhall","affiliation":["Avalanche Technology, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Malmhall","id":"37317000300"},{"name":"Rajiv Ranjan","affiliation":["Avalanche Technology, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Ranjan","id":"37310298500"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Avalanche Technology, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38241644200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1400-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1399-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1398-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"6105332","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1806},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Switches","Nonvolatile memory","Thermal stability","CMOS integrated circuits","Torque","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","concurrency theory","SRAM chips","system-on-chip","thermal stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STT-MRAM","nonvolatile memory","power consumption","phase-change RAM","PRAM","resistive RAM","spin-transfer torque","MTJ device","CMOS integrated chip level","high magnetic bit thermal stability","micromagnetic modeling","STT switching dynamics","market positioning","commodity memory","embedded memory","storage-class solid state drives","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STT-RAM","MTJ","pMTJ","Spintronic Memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6105332","abstract":"New product applications have an increasing demand for a non-volatile memory (NVM) exhibiting higher speeds, extended endurance and lower power consumption as existing solutions are not fully capable to deliver on all of these attributes.

We will review the recent progress on STT-MRAM at both the MTJ device and CMOS integrated chip levels. In the technical area, the key focus is switching current (or voltage) reduction at short pulse width (<;10 ns) while maintaining high magnetic bit thermal stability. Results from novel MTJs achieving low switching current while maintaining high thermal stability will be presented. First generation STT-MRAM products are being targeted using in-plane based MTJs, and future products below 45 nm will likely require perpendicular MTJ (pMTJ) designs. The later is the key focus of recent research in this area. We will review the current state of pMTJ development, along with micromagnetic modeling results for key understanding of STT switching dynamics and latest experimental data of pMTJs. Finally, we discuss the market positioning of the STT-MRAM. While it is currently being targeted for stand-alone commodity memory (replacing DRAM) [4], and embedded memory (replacing embedded Flash, SRAM and DRAM) [6], new market applications such as storage-class solid state drives and embedded solutions in advanced System-on-Chip (SoC) are also being explored. We will compare key value adds from STT-MRAM in these emerging market segments.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105332","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095474/6105287/06105332.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progress and outlook for STT-MRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Progress and outlook for STT-MRAM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12437581","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105332/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105332/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progress and outlook for STT-MRAM","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04103T1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036592S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6105333,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv Joshi","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

To reduce the pin count, broadcast addressing, by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging, has emerged as a promising solution. Nevertheless, naive signal merging has the potential to cause excessive electrode actuations, which has been reported to have direct and adverse effect on chip reliability. According to recent studies, reliability is an important attribute for PDMFBs particularly developed for medical applications as it directly affects the final medical decision making. However, no research findings have been reported on the reliability problem in pin-constrained designs. To make PDMFBs more feasible for practical applications, we propose in this paper the first matching-based reliability-oriented broadcast-addressing algorithm for PDMFBs. We identify the factors that affect reliability and incorporate into the design-technique attributes that enhance reliability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105367","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095474/6105287/06105367.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-oriented broadcast electrode-addressing for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-oriented broadcast electrode-addressing for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437616","htmlLink":"/document/6105367/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-oriented broadcast electrode-addressing for pin-constrained digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"08206D1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069149S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6105369,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536480900"},{"name":"Dimin Niu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Dimin","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409787700"},{"name":"Xiaochun Zhu","affiliation":["Emerging Memory Technology Group, Qualcomm Incorporated, USA","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37278848800"},{"name":"Seung H.

A wide range of write speeds from 1ns to 100ns have been reported for STT-RAM. The switching current of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) (which is the storage element of STT-RAM) is inversely proportional to the write pulse width. In this work, we propose a methodology to design STT-RAM for different optimization goals such as read performance, write performance and write energy by leveraging the trade-off between write current and write time of MTJ. We take the typical in-plane MTJ and advanced perpendicular MTJ (PMTJ) as our optimization targets. Our study shows that reducing write pulse width will harm read latency and energy. It is observed that \u201csweet spots\u201d of write pulse width which minimize the write energy or write latency of STT-RAM caches may exist. The optimal write pulse width depends on MTJ specifications, STT-RAM capacity and I/O width. The simulation results indicate that by utilizing PMTJ, the optimized STT-RAM can compete against SRAM and DRAM as universal memory replacement in low power embedded systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105369","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105369","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095474/6105287/06105369.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-architecture co-optimization of STT-RAM based memory for low power embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Device-architecture co-optimization of STT-RAM based memory for low power embedded systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437618","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6105369/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-architecture co-optimization of STT-RAM based memory for low power embedded systems","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"08406D3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090048S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6105370,"authors":[{"name":"Yaojun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yaojun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240486600"},{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498100"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1400-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1399-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1398-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"6105370","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Magnetic tunneling","MOSFETs","Fluctuations","Random access memory","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","electronics industry","integrated circuit design","random-access storage","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STT-RAM cell design optimization","nonpersistent error rate reduction","persistent error rate reduction","statistical design view","electronic industry","technical scaling","next generation memory technology","spin-transfer torque random access memory","CMOS process compatibility","nanoscale devices","intrinsic device operating uncertainties","environmental fluctuations","MTJ process variations","switching uncertainties","thermal fluctuations","working temperature","circuit simulation platform","magnetic simulation platform","optimization flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spin-transfer torque (STT)","magnetic RAM","process variation","persistent error","non-persistent error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6105370","abstract":"The rapidly increased demands for memory in electronic industry and the significant technical scaling challenges of all conventional memory technologies motivated the researches on the next generation memory technology.

On the other hand, domain-specific preconditioners that explore the underlying physical meaning of the matrices usually work better, but are difficult to design.

In three-dimensional (3D) IC technology, the EM problem becomes more severe due to drastic dimension mismatches between metal wires, through silicon vias (TSVs), and landing pads. Meanwhile, the thermo-mechanical stress due to the TSV can also cause reduction in the failure time of wires. However, there is very little study on EM issues that consider TSVs in 3D ICs. In this paper, we show the impact of TSV stress on EM failure time of metal wires in 3D ICs. We model the impact of TSV on stress variation in wires. We then perform detailed modeling of the impact of stress on EM failure time of metal wires. Based on our analysis, we build a detailed library to predict the failure time of a given wire based on current density, temperature and stress. We then propose a method to perform fast full-chip simulation, to determine the various EM related hot-spots in the design. We also propose a simple routing-blockage scheme to reduce the EM related failures near the TSVs, and see its impact on various metrics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International

SRAM-based FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) use multiplexer-based unidirectional routing, and SRAM configuration cells in these multiplexers contribute to the majority of soft errors in FPGAs. In this paper, we formulate an In-Placed inVersion (IPV) on LUT (Look-Up Table) logic polarities to reduce the Soft Error Rate (SER) at chip level, and reveal a locality and NP-Hardness of the IPV problem. We then develop an exact algorithm based on the binary integer linear programming (ILP) and also a heuristic based on the simulated annealing (SA), both enabled by the locality. We report results for the 10 largest MCNC combinational benchmarks synthesized by ABC and then placed and routed by VPR. The results show that IPV obtains close to 4\u00d7 chip level SER reduction on average and SA is highly effective by obtaining the same SER reduction as ILP does. A recent work IPD has the largest LUT level SER reduction of 2.7\u00d7 in literature, but its chip level SER reduction is merely 7% due to the dominance of interconnects. In contrast, SA-based IPV obtains nearly 4\u00d7 chip level SER reduction and runs 30\u00d7 faster. Furthermore, combining IPV and IPD leads to a chip level SER reduction of 5.3\u00d7. This does not change placement and routing, and does not affect design closure. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first in-depth study on SER reduction for modern multiplexer-based FPGA routing by in-placed logic re-synthesis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437638","htmlLink":"/document/6105389/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mitigating FPGA interconnect soft errors by in-place LUT inversion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating FPGA interconnect soft errors by in-place LUT inversion","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10407C5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108253S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6105391,"authors":[{"name":"Debapriya Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Debapriya","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37597138200"},{"name":"Calvin McCarter","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Calvin","lastName":"McCarter","id":"38232966200"},{"name":"Valeria Bertacco","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Bertacco","id":"37267142300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1400-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1399-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1398-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"6105391","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Estimation","Integrated circuit modeling","Correlation","Logic gates","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer bugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","electronic engineering computing","greedy algorithms","integrated circuit design","monolithic integrated circuits","program debugging","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation-based signal selection","state restoration","silicon debug","post-silicon validation","integrated circuit design","functional bug capture","functional bug elimination","pre-silicon verification escape","register buffers","post-silicon debugging","post-silicon diagnosis","probability-based state-restoration capacity metric","greedy algorithm","trace buffer size"]}],"abstract":"Post-silicon validation has become a crucial part of modern integrated circuit design to capture and eliminate functional bugs that escape pre-silicon verification. The most critical roadblock in post-silicon validation is the limited observability of internal signals of a design, since this aspect hinders the ability to diagnose detected bugs. A solution to address this issue leverage trace buffers: these are register buffers embedded into the design with the goal of recording the value of a small number of state elements, over a time interval, triggered by a user-specified event. Due to the trace buffer's area overhead, only a very small fraction of signals can be traced. Thus, the selection of which signals to trace is of paramount importance in post-silicon debugging and diagnosis. Ideally, we would like to select signals enabling the maximum amount of reconstruction of internal signal values. Several signal selection algorithms for post-silicon debug have been proposed in the literature: they rely on a probability-based state-restoration capacity metric coupled with a greedy algorithm. In this work we propose a more accurate restoration capacity metric, based on simulation information, and present a novel algorithm that overcomes some key shortcomings of previous solutions. We show that our technique provides up to 34% better state restoration compared to all previous techniques while showing a much better trend with increasing trace buffer size.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation-based signal selection for state restoration in silicon debug","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105391","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095474/6105287/06105391.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6105391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Simulation-based signal selection for state restoration in silicon debug","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105391/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12437640","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation-based signal selection for state restoration in silicon debug","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10608B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061264S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6105401,"authors":[{"name":"Rangharajan Venkatesan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Rangharajan","lastName":"Venkatesan","id":"37722193100"},{"name":"Amit Agarwal","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273299900"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"},{"name":"Anand Raghunathan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Raghunathan","id":"37275475300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1400-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1399-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1398-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"6105401","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":146,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1560},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6105401","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Boolean functions","Data structures","Integrated circuit modeling","Logic gates","Adders","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","error statistics","integrated circuit modelling","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MACACO","modeling and analysis of circuits for approximate computing","worst-case error","average-case error","error probability","error distribution","voltage over-scaling","over-clocking","functional approximations","logic complexity reduction","equivalent untimed circuit","Boolean analysis techniques","statistical techniques"]}],"abstract":"Approximate computing, which refers to a class of techniques that relax the requirement of exact equivalence between the specification and implementation of a computing system, has attracted significant interest in recent years. We propose a systematic methodology, called MACACO, for the Modeling and Analysis of Circuits for Approximate Computing. The proposed methodology can be utilized to analyze how an approximate circuit behaves with reference to a conventional correct implementation, by computing metrics such as worst-case error, average-case error, error probability, and error distribution. The methodology applies to both timing-induced approximations such as voltage over-scaling or over-clocking, and functional approximations based on logic complexity reduction. The first step in MACACO is the construction of an equivalent untimed circuit that represents the behavior of the approximate circuit at a given voltage and clock period. Next, we construct a virtual error circuit that represents the error in the approximate circuit's output for any given input or input sequence. Finally, we apply conventional Boolean analysis techniques (SAT solvers, BDDs) and statistical techniques (Monte-Carlo simulation) in order to compute the various metrics of interest. We have applied the proposed methodology to analyze a range of approximate designs for datapath building blocks. Our results show that MACACO can help a designer to systematically evaluate the impact of approximate circuits, and to choose between different approximate implementations, thereby facilitating the adoption of such circuits for approximate computing.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2011.6105401","startPage":"667","endPage":"673","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095474/6105287/06105401.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MACACO: Modeling and analysis of circuits for approximate computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105401/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"MACACO: Modeling and analysis of circuits for approximate computing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12437650","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6105401/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MACACO: Modeling and analysis of circuits for approximate computing","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"11609B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100472S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095474","isNumber":"6105287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095474","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"6105287","articleId":"6105401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6105405,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Li","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37598555300"},{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratory, USA","University of Notre Dame, USA"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"38238959500"},{"name":"Jung Ho Ahn","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Ho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37673865600"},{"name":"Jay B.

The W-band wireless carrier is generated from heterodyne mixing the OOFDM baseband signal with a free-running laser. A W-band electronic down-converter and a digital signal processing-based receiver are used. Three-channel QPSK-OFDM W-band wireless signals are transmitted over 0.5- and 2-m air distance with and without 22.8-km single-mode fiber, respectively, with achieved performance below the forward error correction limit.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2011.2179797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6145764/06105517.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2011.2179797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145764","startPage":"383","endPage":"385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber Wireless Transmission of 8.3-Gb/s/ch QPSK-OFDM Signals in 75\u2013110-GHz Band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6105517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fiber Wireless Transmission of 8.3-Gb/s/ch QPSK-OFDM Signals in 75\u2013110-GHz Band","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2012","accessionNumber":"12536676","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6105517/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber Wireless Transmission of 8.3-Gb/s/ch QPSK-OFDM Signals in 75\u2013110-GHz Band","sourcePdf":"lpt-deng-2179797-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050534S","chronDate":"March1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6145764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6145764","articleId":"6105517","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6105518,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian N.

All schemes successfully avoid large error-bursts due to residual phase ambiguity after digital carrier recovery. Only the complex implementation of the recursive multisymbol phase estimation provides SD samples to subsequent SD-FEC and reaches substantial recovery of the differential penalty at the same time. None of the schemes can overcome the hard-decision differential penalty.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mitigation of the Differential Decoding Penalty in 100G PDM-QPSK Digital Coherent Receivers for Multirate WDM Transmission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2011.2179932","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6154793/06105518.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2011.2179932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6154793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6105518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Mitigation of the Differential Decoding Penalty in 100G PDM-QPSK Digital Coherent Receivers for Multirate WDM Transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6105518/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","publicationDate":"March15, 2012","accessionNumber":"12543582","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mitigation of the Differential Decoding Penalty in 100G PDM-QPSK Digital Coherent Receivers for Multirate WDM Transmission","sourcePdf":"lpt-hauske-2179932-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05848S","chronDate":"March15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6154793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","xplore-issue":"6154793","articleId":"6105518","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6105520,"authors":[{"name":"Tolulope B.

Compared with evolutionary algorithm, the artificial immune system used for solving MO problems (MOPs) has shown many good performances in improving the convergence speed and maintaining the diversity of the antibody population. However, the simple clonal selection computation has some difficulties in handling some more complex MOPs. In this paper, the simple clonal selection strategy is improved and a novel immune clonal algorithm (NICA) is proposed. The improvements in NICA are mainly focus on four aspects. 1) Antibodies in the antibody population are divided into dominated ones and nondominated ones, which is suitable for the characteristic of one multiobjective optimization problem has a series Pareto-optimal solutions. 2) The entire cloning is adopted instead of different antibodies having different clonal rate. 3) The clonal selection is based on the Pareto-dominance and one antibody is selected or not depending on whether it is a nondominated one, which is different from the traditional clonal selection manner. 4) The antibody population updating operation after the clonal selection is adopted, which makes antibody population under a certain size and guarantees the convergence of the algorithm. The influences of the main parameters are analyzed empirically. Compared with the existed algorithms, simulation results on MOPs and constrained MOPs show that NICA in most problems is able to And much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2046328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"35","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2046328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141203","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6141203/06105568.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Immune system","Vectors","Cloning","Optimization","Measurement","Convergence","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel immune clonal algorithm","MO problems","multiobjective optimization","intelligent computation","evolutionary algorithm","antibody population","NICA","Pareto-optimal solutions","artificial immune systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial immune system (AIS)","multiobjective optimization (MO)","pareto-optimal front","performance metric"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Immune Clonal Algorithm for MO Problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105568/","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6105568/","accessionNumber":"12494171","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Immune Clonal Algorithm for MO Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-rshang-2046328-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126758S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6141203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6141203","articleId":"6105568","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6105570,"authors":[{"name":"David Sweeting","affiliation":["Sweeting Consulting, Saint Ives, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6170956/6105570/6105570-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Sweeting (M'09\u2013SM'11) received the B.S., B.Eng., and D.Phil. degrees in electrical engineering from The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.","He spent four years in Switzerland with Brown Boveri where he worked on circuit breaker development and testing before returning to Australia to join the Sydney County Council, an electrical distribution authority where he held positions in substations and overhead transmission and ran the high-power testing station.

The magnonic pulses are used to destabilize the magnetic free layer from its initial direction, and are followed immediately by a bipolar electric current exerting conventional spin-transfer torque on the free layer. The combination of thermal and electric currents greatly reduces switching errors, and simultaneously reduces the electric switching current density by more than an order of magnitude as compared to conventional STT-MRAM. The energy efficiency of several possible electro-thermal circuit designs have been analyzed numerically. As compared to STT-MRAM with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, magnonic STT-MRAM reduces the overall switching energy by almost 80%. Furthermore, the lower electric current density allows the use of thicker tunnel barriers, which should result in higher tunneling magneto-resistance and improved tunnel barrier reliability. The combination of lower power, improved reliability, higher integration density, and larger read margin make magnonic STT-MRAM a promising choice for future non-volatile storage.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2179982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2179982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6202766/06105574.pdf","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6202766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnonic Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM With Low Power, High Speed, and Error-Free Switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Magnonic Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM With Low Power, High Speed, and Error-Free Switching","volume":"48","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12850553","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105574/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnonic Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM With Low Power, High Speed, and Error-Free Switching","sourcePdf":"tmag-mojumder-2179982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099406S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6202766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6202766","articleId":"6105574","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6105581,"authors":[{"name":"Salama Said Ikki","affiliation":["National Institute of Scientific Research-Energy, Materials and Telecommunications, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Salama Said","lastName":"Ikki","id":"38262743800"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["National Institute of Scientific Research-Energy, Materials and Telecommunications, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6105581","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1497},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Error probability","Interference","Spread spectrum communication","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","approximation theory","cochannel interference","decode and forward communication","error statistics","optimisation","radio networks","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop wireless relaying systems","cochannel interferences","design optimization","multihop wireless networks","amplify-and-forward relaying","AF relaying","Rayleigh fading channels","end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","upper bound","cumulative distribution function","probability density function","CDF","PDF","error probability","approximate expression","general asymptotic expression","decode-and-forward multihop","DP multihop","ergodic capacity","power allocation","network transmit nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","cochannel interference","decode-and-forward (DF)","ergodic capacity","error probability","multihop wireless networks","optimization","power allocation","relay positioning"]}],"abstract":"A study of the effect of cochannel interference on the performance of multihop wireless networks with amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is presented.

Then, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) and probability density function (pdf) of the upper bounded end-to-end SINR are determined. Based on those results, closed-form expression for the error probability is obtained. Furthermore, an approximate expression for the pdf of the instantaneous end-to-end SINR is derived, and based on this, a simple and general asymptotic expression for the error probability is presented and discussed. In addition, the ergodic capacity of multihop wireless networks in the presence of external interference is studied.

Specifically, due to the buffering and batch processing involved in network coding, transitions between busy and idle periods in channel use are expected to be less frequent, which, in turn, result in a more predictable structure of network-coded communications, compared with traditional store-and-forward-based transmissions. For broadcast communications over erasure channels, we characterize how network coding adds memory to the channel use at the traffic level and increases the spectrum predictability, compared with the plain retransmission scheme. This traffic-shaping effect of network coding can be readily applied to cognitive radio networks. In particular, we develop adaptive spectrum sensing for secondary users (SUs) to exploit the induced predictability in primary user channels with network-coded transmissions and show that the throughput of SUs is significantly improved. On the other hand, we caution that the predictable structure of network-coded transmissions also makes wireless channels more susceptible to jamming attacks. Our results lead to a new understanding of network coding as a spectrum shaper and reveal the inherent tradeoffs between the throughput and security objectives resulting from the spectrum predictability induced by network coding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12527198","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Induced Spectrum Predictability Via Wireless Network Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Induced Spectrum Predictability Via Wireless Network Coding","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2179956-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057865S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6105584","onlineDate":"15 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6105586,"authors":[{"name":"Maja Vidojkovic","affiliation":["Holst Centre, Imec-NL, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6111547/6105586/6105586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maja Vidojkovic received the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161, Serbia and the Ph.D. degree from Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.","During her Ph.D., she was working on \u201cConfigurable Circuits and Their Impact on Multi-Standard RF Front-End Architectures.\u201d In 2008, she joined the wireless research group as a Researcher at Holst Centre/imec-NL, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.

In this paper, we will review several ideas from [1] including polarimetric techniques and spectral resonances which might further advance the field both for detection and hyperthermic treatment of the tumor and see how they are being used today as described in the literature.

BFN calibration must be ensured in order to enable continuous Beamforming to any selected pointing angle. In addition, the calibration minimizes the squint errors. Moreover, the calibration correct the time delay mismatches that the difference between RF channels create. Taking into account that the BFN is able to control the continuous beam pattern direction, we can also apply a variety of weighting functions (tapering) according to application. The adopted weighting leads, as expected, to a controlled beam pattern and side lobes level. The calibration process is accomplished adaptively, which guarantees an optimal continuous beam pattern and low BFN sensitivity to interference. A BFN system, which is able create continuous pointing angles, has been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105811/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12442306","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105811/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Overview of calibration process for wideband beamforming network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of calibration process for wideband beamforming network","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109673S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094290","isNumber":"6105761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094290","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6105761","articleId":"6105811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6105812,"authors":[{"name":"Papa Moussa Ndao","affiliation":["I.E.T.R.

amplifier (PA) fabricated in a 0.12 \u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Three cascode stages, followed by two common-emitter stages were utilized to achieve power gain of 30dB with 12dBm output power at 1dB compression and saturated power of 14dBm. Small signal characteristics show peak gain achieved at 86GHz with both input and output matching is better than -15dB from 77GHz to 87GHz. A 40dB image rejection is accomplished by a selective notch filter also integrated on chip. The PA's bias is applied by digitally adjustable bias circuits to provide process and temperature compensation and was measured in room temperature, 50\u00b0C and 85\u00b0C. It consumes quiescent currents of 120mA and 85mA from a 2V and 2.7V supplies respectively at 1dB compression and occupies area of 1.6mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2011.6105852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2011.6105852","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094290/6105761/06105852.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2011)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A millimeter-wave SiGe power amplifier with highly selective image reject filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A millimeter-wave SiGe power amplifier with highly selective image reject filter","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105852/","accessionNumber":"12442347","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105852/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A millimeter-wave SiGe power amplifier with highly selective image reject filter","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059925S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094290","isNumber":"6105761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094290","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6105761","articleId":"6105852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6105866,"authors":[{"name":"Avraham Freedman","affiliation":["Nice Systems Limited, Raanana, Israel"],"firstName":"Avraham","lastName":"Freedman","id":"37272929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1694-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1692-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1693-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6105866","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Mobile communication","Delay","Fading","Reflection","Accuracy","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobile antennas","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular location","urban environment","ray tracing","mobile cellular terminal","geographical information","single antenna location","trilateration-based algorithm","geometric depletion of precision","signal fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Position measurement","ray tracing","Rayleigh channels","multipath channels","pattern matching","geographic information system"]}],"abstract":"The paper discusses the problem of location a mobile cellular terminal within an urban, multipath-rich environment, using available geographical information such as terrain and building maps. The method suggested in the paper is the use of ray tracing in order to characterize the propagation environment.

The main purpose of the paper is to present the problems encountered in implementation including inaccuracies in the geographical and network databases, signal fading, measurement accuracy, location ambiguity and geometric depletion of precision (GDOP).

For certain configurations however the adjacent channel leakage is increased, thus the standards require a power back-off for these cases. A reliable estimate for the power-back-off is the cubic metric. The large number of computations necessary for cubic metric determination can be reduced to a minimum by a versatile interpolation method. This method will be reviewed in this presentation.

Gain provided by the latter is counteracted by the power required to run the algorithm at shorter distances. The system is designed for Strong Arm SA-1100 processor platform Thus, power-optimal solutions becomes efficient for LMS below the critical distance and for Ghavami beyond it.","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2011.6105901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2011.6105901","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094290/6105761/06105901.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2011)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for analysis of optimal power solutions for smart antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A framework for analysis of optimal power solutions for smart antennas","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6105901/","accessionNumber":"12442396","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6105901/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for analysis of optimal power solutions for smart antennas","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041156S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094290","isNumber":"6105761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094290","xplore-issue":"6105761","articleId":"6105901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6105906,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Smith and Waterman proposed an exact algorithm (SW) that compares two sequences in quadratic time and space. Due to high computing and memory requirements, SW is usually executed on HPC platforms such as multicore clusters and CellBEs. Since HPC architectures exhibit very different hardware characteristics, porting an application between them is an error-prone time-consuming task. BSP++ is an implementation of BSP that aims to reduce the effort to write parallel code. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a parallel BSP++ strategy to execute SW in multiple platforms like MPI, OpenMP, MPI/OpenMP, CellBE and MPI/CellBE. The results obtained with real DNA sequences show that the performance of our versions is comparable to the ones in the literature, evidencing the appropriateness and flexibility of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 23rd International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105662/6105987/06106015.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"143","publicationTitle":"2011 23rd International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2011.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2011.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6105987","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Biological Sequence Comparison on Heterogeneous High Performance Computing Platforms with BSP++","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Object oriented modeling","Vectors","DNA","Biological information theory","Multicore processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel biological sequence comparison","heterogeneous high performance computing","bioinformatics","HPC platform","parallel BSP++","MPI","OpenMP","CellBE","DNA sequences","bulk synchronous parallel model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Biological Sequence Comparison on Heterogeneous High Performance Computing Platforms with BSP++","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6106015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441887","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Biological Sequence Comparison on Heterogeneous High Performance Computing Platforms with BSP++","confLoc":"Vitoria, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4573a136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072295S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105662","isNumber":"6105987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105662","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6105987","articleId":"6106015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6106180,"authors":[{"name":"Nam Doan Ngoc Chi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Nam","lastName":"Doan Ngoc Chi","id":"37087064785"},{"name":"Truong Dinh Quang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Truong","lastName":"Dinh Quang","id":"37087065199"},{"name":"Jong Il Yoon","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, KR"],"firstName":"Jong Il","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37406957400"},{"name":"Kyoung Kwan Ahn","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung Kwan","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37302333500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-93215-03-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0835-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2093-7121"}],"articleNumber":"6106180","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Polymers","Adaptation models","Chirp","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","autoregressive processes","fuzzy set theory","metals","particle swarm optimisation","polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ionic polymer metal composite actuator","fuzzy NARX model","particle swam optimization","nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model","polymer network","open loop input voltage signal","IPMC bending actuation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IPMC","identification","fuzzy","Nonlinear Auto Regressive Exogenous model","Particle Swam Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106180","abstract":"An ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) actuator is an Electro-Active Polymer (EAP) that bends in response to a small applied electrical field as a result of mobility of cations in the polymer network.

Many large-scale storage systems such as HDFS involve the decoupling of metadata management from file data access. In such architecture, a single master server manages all metadata, while a number of data servers store file data. This architecture can't meet the exponentially increased storage demand in cloud computing, as the single master server may become a performance bottleneck. This paper presents a metadata management scheme based on HDFS for cloud computing. Our scheme employs multiple Namenodes, and divides the metadata into \u201cbuckets\u201d which can be dynamically migrated among Namenodes according to system workloads. To maintain reliability, metadata is replicated in different Namenodes with log replication technology, and Paxos algorithm is adopted to keep replication consistency. Besides, caching and prefetching technology is integrated to improve system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6106475/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12442171","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed metadata management scheme in cloud computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed metadata management scheme in cloud computing","confLoc":"Port Elizabeth, South Africa","sourcePdf":"Paper007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148205S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094118","isNumber":"6106461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094118","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6106461","articleId":"6106475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6106487,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yifei Wei","id":"37407040600"},{"name":"Mei Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mei Song","id":"37278154700"},{"name":"Baoling Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Baoling Liu","id":"37558298800"},{"name":"Xiaojun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaojun Wang","id":"37293610900"},{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yong Li","id":"37279888300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0208-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0209-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0207-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6106487","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":812},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Green products","Power control","Antennas","Wireless communication","Switches","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution","cellular radio","cognitive radio","communication complexity","cooperative communication","energy conservation","environmental factors","profitability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient cooperative relaying","cognitive radio technology","green communication","wireless communication systems","system complexity","energy consumption","greenhouse gases","greenhouse pollution","energy costs","mobile communication","energy saving","network venders","wireless networks","profitability","paradigm-shifting technologies","green cellular network"]}],"abstract":"So far, achieving high data rate has been the primary focus of research in wireless communication systems, without much consideration of energy efficiency. However, many of communication technologies significantly increase system complexity and energy consumption. In addition to the environmental problems that the governments restrict the greenhouse gases and pollution, energy costs also contribute a significant part of network operator's overall expenditures due to the rapidly growing demand for mobile communication. Therefore, energy saving approaches are urgently required by both governments and network venders. Escalating energy costs and environmental concerns have already created an urgent need for more energy-efficient wireless communication. To address the challenge of increasing power efficiency in wireless networks and thereby to maintain profitability, this paper will discuss some research issues and challenges and suggest some paradigm-shifting technologies to enable an energy efficient or green cellular network.","doi":"10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106487","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094118/6106461/06106487.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106487","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","startPage":"105","endPage":"109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient cooperative relaying and cognitive radio technologies to deliver green communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient cooperative relaying and cognitive radio technologies to deliver green communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106487/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6106487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442183","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient cooperative relaying and cognitive radio technologies to deliver green communication","confLoc":"Port Elizabeth, South Africa","sourcePdf":"Paper019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055251S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094118","isNumber":"6106461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094118","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6106461","articleId":"6106487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6106497,"authors":[{"name":"Song Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Song Li","id":"38239959500"},{"name":"Bin Gong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Bin Gong","id":"37266277600"},{"name":"Yi Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Yi Hu","id":"37535758100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0208-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0209-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0207-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6106497","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":447},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","cloud computing","portals","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["freely expanding on-demand resource allocation","power saving","Infrastructure as a Service","IaaS","cloud computing service","virtual machine instance","physical resource","API","portal component","portlet container","service model","Eucalyptus Portlet Service","open source cloud computing platform","Web portal framework","GridShpere"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","IaaS","Eucalyptus","Portlets","Gridsphere portals","Eucalyptus Portlets","Eucalyptus Portlets Services"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing has emerged as an attractive computing model with the features of freely expanding, on-demand resource allocating, and power saving. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), a category of Cloud computing services, provides users an environment to run and control entire virtual machine instances deployed across variety physical resources. Portlets are defined as a standard API and provide a model for developing new portal components that can be shared by various portlet containers. This paper proposes a service model, core of which is building Portlet Services between Cloud computing platforms and Portlets to provide developers a framework for developing portlets of the Cloud computing platforms. To illustrate the model, we build Eucalyptus Portlet Services upon the open source Cloud computing platform Eucalyptus, and develop a set of portlets that based the services to present Eucalyptus platform into the web portal framework GridShpere.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of portlet services of cloud computing platforms","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106497","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094118/6106461/06106497.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of portlet services of cloud computing platforms","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6106497/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of portlet services of cloud computing platforms","confLoc":"Port Elizabeth, South Africa","sourcePdf":"Paper029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059533S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094118","isNumber":"6106461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094118","xplore-issue":"6106461","articleId":"6106497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6106526,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhui Wang","affiliation":["PCN&CAD Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenhui Wang","id":"38240643100"},{"name":"Jing Han","affiliation":["PCN&CAD Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jing Han","id":"37064950400"},{"name":"Meina Song","affiliation":["PCN&CAD Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Meina Song","id":"37278155400"},{"name":"Xiaohui Wang","affiliation":["PCN&CAD Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohui Wang","id":"37986583200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0208-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0209-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0207-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6106526","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1184},"abstract":"Today, the problem of trusting cloud computing is a paramount concern for most enterprises. Whether user behavior is trusted and how to evaluate user's behavior trust are important research contents in cloud computing. This paper suggests an adaptive access algorithm by introducing the trust into cloud computing to decide the access control to the resources using an improved RBAC technique to solve more complex and difficult problems in the cloud computing environment. And the proposed model determines dynamically security level and access control for the common resources. Therefore, it is supposed to provide appropriate security services according to the dynamic changes of the common resources. This access control model bases on trust determines whether the user has the right to get access to the resource by dynamically authorizing. And this mechanism can control the user's malicious behavior effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094118/6106461/06106526.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of a trust and role based access control model in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Education","Security","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trusting cloud computing","role based access control model","improved RBAC technique","security level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"The design of a trust and role based access control model in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6106526/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442221","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of a trust and role based access control model in cloud computing","confLoc":"Port Elizabeth, South Africa","sourcePdf":"Paper057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05436S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094118","isNumber":"6106461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094118","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6106461","articleId":"6106526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6106531,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Han","affiliation":["PCN&CAD Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","PCN&CAD Center, Beijng University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijng, China"],"lastName":"Jing Han","id":"37086891563"},{"name":"Haihong E","affiliation":["PCN&CAD Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","PCN&CAD Center, Beijng University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijng, China"],"lastName":"Haihong E","id":"37086894770"},{"name":"Guan Le","affiliation":["PCN&CAD Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","PCN&CAD Center, Beijng University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijng, China"],"lastName":"Guan Le","id":"37086894962"},{"name":"Jian Du","affiliation":["Super Instruments Corporation, Beijng, China"],"lastName":"Jian Du","id":"37086895186"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0208-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0209-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0207-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6106531","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":20260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Facebook","Computational modeling","Blogs","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","query processing","relational databases","SQL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NoSQL database","Internet","cloud computing","relational database","high-concurrency applications","search engines","SNS","query dynamic user data","data model","CAP theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NoSQL","key-value","column-oriented","document","database","Big Data"]}],"abstract":"With the development of the Internet and cloud computing, there need databases to be able to store and process big data effectively, demand for high-performance when reading and writing, so the traditional relational database is facing many new challenges.

Continuous and discrete time versions of this algorithm are analyzed. First, it is shown that the distributed power allocation scheme can be visualized as a tracking problem of an equivalent power reference that specifies the desired quality-of-service (QoS). For this purpose, a proportional controller is then employed under integral action in order to achieve good tracking despite time-varying and unknown channel gains. Next, the effects of constant and time-varying time delays in the closed-loop structure are studied. Explicit stability regions for the control gain in the Foschini-Miljanic scheme are derived for both the continuous and discrete-time versions of the algorithm, under constant and time-varying delays. A comprehensive evaluation using simulations is performed to validate the analytical derivations described in the paper.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Stability criteria","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","closed loop systems","continuous time systems","delays","discrete time systems","power control","proportional control","quality of service","radio tracking","stability","telecommunication control","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability margins","Foschini-Miljanic power allocation","constant delays","time-varying delays","power control","universal mobile telecommunication systems","UMTS","continuous time","discrete time","distributed power allocation","tracking problem","equivalent power reference","quality-of-service","QoS","proportional controller","closed-loop structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power control","quality of service","distributed control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106612","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094291/6106064/06106612.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of stability margins of the Foschini-Miljanic power allocation strategy under constant and time-varying delays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of stability margins of the Foschini-Miljanic power allocation strategy under constant and time-varying delays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106612/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6106612/","accessionNumber":"12503264","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of stability margins of the Foschini-Miljanic power allocation strategy under constant and time-varying delays","confLoc":"Merida City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070063S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094291","isNumber":"6106064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094291","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6106064","articleId":"6106612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6106614,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel U.

The sources of uncertainty are assumed to come from the quantization process and measurement noise in the closed-loop system. The power allocation problem is formulated as a reference tracking problem of a pre-defined signal to noise-interference ratio. First, the synthesis problem with SNR constraints is studied as a 2-norm minimization process, which is equivalent to an LQR optimization problem. The solution of the associated Riccati equation in the LQR formulation is completely characterized, resulting in a state-feedback law with a special redundant structure. This control law is re-written in a transfer function format, where it is obtained a simple control strategy which is dependant on the round-trip delay in the feedback system. In addition, the corresponding 2-norm closed-loop performance is also studied. Thus, the selection of the weight in the LQR problem establishes a compromise between robustness to quantization errors and noise, and tracking performance. Finally, the analytical results are validated through simulation by considering time-varying channel gains and quantization in the feedback information.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106614","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094291/6106064/06106614.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation in UMTS under SNR constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation in UMTS under SNR constraints","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6106614/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12503266","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation in UMTS under SNR constraints","confLoc":"Merida City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094658S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094291","isNumber":"6106064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094291","xplore-issue":"6106064","articleId":"6106614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6106620,"authors":[{"name":"V.

contains noisy data. The overall aim is to quickly detect the entire set of ellipses, without additional information about the sizes, and shapes of the ellipses, and the amount of noise in the data set, but knowing the number of ellipses and providing a threshold value. In this work, we develop and investigate-based on a standard GA-three different fitness functions which have different advantages and disadvantages. From numerical results we verify that we are yet able to reliably and efficiently compute the set of ellipses in certain situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12503303","htmlLink":"/document/6106652/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fitness function evaluation for the detection of multiple ellipses using a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fitness function evaluation for the detection of multiple ellipses using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Merida City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06184S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094291","isNumber":"6106064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094291","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6106064","articleId":"6106652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6106673,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Rosales-Roldan","affiliation":["Postgraduate Section, Mechanical Electrical Engineering School, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Rosales-Roldan","id":"38295228200"},{"name":"Manuel Cedillo-Hern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Postgraduate Section, Mechanical Electrical Engineering School, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Cedillo-Hern\u00e1ndez","id":"38273572600"},{"name":"Mariko Nakano-Miyatake","affiliation":["Postgraduate Section, Mechanical Electrical Engineering School, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico"],"firstName":"Mariko","lastName":"Nakano-Miyatake","id":"38285329500"},{"name":"H\u00e9ctor P\u00e9rez-Meana","affiliation":["Postgraduate Section, Mechanical Electrical Engineering School, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico"],"firstName":"H\u00e9ctor","lastName":"P\u00e9rez-Meana","id":"38273159500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1013-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1011-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1012-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6106673","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Gray-scale","Discrete cosine transforms","Authentication","Approximation algorithms","Robustness","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","document image processing","feature extraction","image sequences","image watermarking","multilayer perceptrons","object detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["watermarking-based tamper detection algorithm","recovery algorithm","official document","grayscale image","image digest","watermark sequence","integer wavelet transform","watermark embedding","discrete cosine transform","multilayer perceptron neural network","JPEG compression","inverse halftoning process","image quality","halftone image extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Watermarking","Tamper Detection","Recovery Capability","Halftoning","IWT","DCT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106673","abstract":"This paper proposes two watermarking-based algorithms for temper detection and recovery of the tampered regions, which can be applied to official documents, such as digitized passports and governmental registrations. In both algorithms, a halftone version of the original grayscale image is used as an approximated version of the host image (image digest), which is then embedded as a watermark sequence into the frequency domains of the host image. In the first algorithm, the Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) is used for watermark embedding (WIA-IWT); while in the second one, the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain is used for this purpose (WIA-DCT). The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of both algorithms against content preserved modifications, such as JPEG compression, as well as recovery capability. Moreover, we employ a Multilayer Perceptron neural network (MLP) in inverse halftoning process to improve the recovered image quality, where the gray-scale of the modified area is estimated by the MLP using the extracted halftone image. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106673","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094291/6106064/06106673.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Watermarking-based tamper detection and recovery algorithms for official documents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Watermarking-based tamper detection and recovery algorithms for official documents","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6106673/","accessionNumber":"12503324","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106673/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Watermarking-based tamper detection and recovery algorithms for official documents","confLoc":"Merida City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045021S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094291","isNumber":"6106064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094291","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6106064","articleId":"6106673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6106684,"authors":[{"name":"Patricia Mej\u00eda-Ch\u00e1vez","affiliation":["Department of Graduate Studies and Research, ESIME Culhuacan-IPN, Mexico, Distrito Federal, Mexico"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Mej\u00eda-Ch\u00e1vez","id":"38363780600"},{"name":"Juan C.

Two heuristic optimizations provide over 3\u00d7 speedup versus a sequential baseline. In our parallel approach, sets of design signals are assigned to different processor cores and routed concurrently. Communication between cores is through the message passing interface communications protocol. We propose a geographic partitioning of signals into independent sets to help minimize the communication overhead. Our parallel implementation provides approximately 2.3\u00d7 speedup using four cores and produces deterministic/repeatable results. When combined, the parallel and heuristic techniques provide over 7\u00d7 speedup with four cores versus the router in the widely used Versatile Place and Route (VPR) FPGA placement/routing framework, with no significant impact on circuit speed or wirelength.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6106029/06106729.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating FPGA Routing Through Parallelization and Engineering Enhancements Special Section on PAR-CAD 2010","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2165715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2165715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating FPGA Routing Through Parallelization and Engineering Enhancements Special Section on PAR-CAD 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425425","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6106729/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating FPGA Routing Through Parallelization and Engineering Enhancements Special Section on PAR-CAD 2010","sourcePdf":"tcad-anderson-2165715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084805S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6106029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6106029","articleId":"6106729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6106733,"authors":[{"name":"Nachiket Kapre","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6106029/6106733/6106733-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nachiket Kapre (S'03\u2013M'10) received the S.M. degree in electrical engineering, the S.M. degree in computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 2005, 2006, and 2010, respectively.","Since 2010, he has been a Junior Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K. He is primarily interested in understanding and exploiting the potential of spatial parallelism for implementing computation.

We develop a parallel, FPGA-based, heterogeneous architecture customized for accelerating the SPICE simulator to deliver this speedup. To properly parallelize the complete simulator, we decompose SPICE into its three constituent phases-model evaluation, sparse matrix-solve, and iteration control-and customize a spatial architecture for each phase independently. Our heterogeneous FPGA organization mixes very large instruction word, dataflow and streaming architectures into a cohesive, unified design to match the parallel patterns exposed by our programming framework. This FPGA architecture is able to outperform conventional processors due to a combination of factors, including high utilization of statically-scheduled resources, low-overhead dataflow scheduling of fine-grained tasks, and streaming, overlapped processing of the control algorithms. We demonstrate that we can independently accelerate model evaluation by a mean factor of 6.5 \u00d7 (1.4-23\u00d7) across a range of nonlinear device models and matrix solve by 2.4\u00d7(0.6-13\u00d7) across various benchmark matrices while delivering a mean combined speedup of 2.8\u00d7(0.2-11\u00d7) for the composite design when comparing a Xilinx Virtex-6 LX760 (40 nm) with an Intel Core i7 965 (45 nm).

These thermal-aware design technologies of the future strongly depend on the availability of efficient and accurate means for thermal modeling and analysis. These thermal models must have not only the sufficient accuracy to capture the complex mechanisms that regulate thermal diffusion in ICs, but also a level of abstraction that allows for their fast execution for design space exploration. In this paper, we propose an innovative thermal modeling approach for full-chips that can handle the scalability problem of transient heat flow simulation in large 2-D/3-D multiprocessor ICs. This is achieved by parallelizing the computation-intensive task of transient temperature tracking using neural networks and exploiting the computational power of massively parallel graphics processing units.

Vectorless power grid verification methods, by solving linear programming (LP) problems under current constraints, enable worst-case voltage drop predictions at an early stage of design when the specific waveforms of current drains are unknown. In this paper, a novel power grid verification algorithm based on hierarchical constraints is proposed. By introducing novel power constraints, the proposed algorithm generates more realistic current patterns and provides less pessimistic voltage drop predictions. The model order reduction-based coefficient computation algorithm reduces the complexity of formulating the LP problems from being proportional to steps to being independent of steps. Utilizing the special hierarchical constraint structure, the submodular polyhedron greedy algorithm dramatically reduces the complexity of solving the LP problems from over \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">km</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) to roughly \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">km</i>\nlog\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">km</i>\n), where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">km</i>\n is the number of variables.

Here it is shown how the video stream from an UAV can be analyzed to automatically detect motion in the scene while the vehicle is moving itself. Concretely, it is shown how a spectral image registration method, the improved Fourier Mellin Invariant method (iFMI), can be used for video stabilization and motion segmentation. The method is first analyzed with scenes containing artificial markers for ground truth evaluation.

Theoretical analysis is done to determine the signal-to-noise ratio of such network and analysis of the performances in term of bit error rates are presented. Simulations are done using Optisys software version 6.0. Motivation to this research is driven to take advantage of both the low implementation cost of the SCM technology which uses the existing RF/microwave devices; and the attractive SAC which reduce the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) in OCDMA system. The use of ZCC code can eradicate phase induced intensity noise (PUN) which will contribute to better BER. For typical error rate of optical communication system of 10e-9, it has been observed fro theoretical results that the new hybrid SCM/OCDMA system provide better spectral efficiency and accommodate more users simultaneously with less code length and thus lower cost of implementations than the traditional OCDMA network utilizing the ZCC code. Thus this system could be one promising solution to the symmetric high capacity access network with high spectral efficiency, cost effective, good flexibility and enhanced security, which makes an attractive candidate for next generation broadband access network.","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2011.6106877","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Photonics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096322/6106807/06106877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2011.6106877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106807","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of SAC-OCDMA system utilizing subcarrier multiplexing technique for high capacity access network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of SAC-OCDMA system utilizing subcarrier multiplexing technique for high capacity access network","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106877/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441701","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6106877/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of SAC-OCDMA system utilizing subcarrier multiplexing technique for high capacity access network","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569468795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048182S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096322","isNumber":"6106807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096322","xplore-issue":"6106807","articleId":"6106877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6106878,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Fadhil Radhi","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University Malaysia Pedis, Pedis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ibrahim Fadhil","lastName":"Radhi","id":"38309432800"},{"name":"S.

A performance comparison has been made between various OCDMA signature sequences (random diagonal (RD), modified double weight (MDW), and modified quadratic congruence (MQC) codes). Analytical expressions have been used to analyze the bit-error rate (BER) value for each code. Our analysis shows that the system performance of the RD code is better than the MDW and MQC codes in a local area network (LAN) (for active users less than 60). Furthermore, the MDW code is more applicable in a wide area network (WAN) (for active users greater than 60). However, the BER value of the MQC code is more than the RD and the MDW codes. The MQC code shows worse system performance over other SAC OCDMA codes in LAN and WAN access networks. In other words, the value of BER is high and number of users is less than the other SAC codes.

In its current form, this modem supports only Single-Input Single-Output communications. In this paper, the authors investigate the use of Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology. MIMO, applied to underwater acoustic (UWA) communications, has shown great promise in terms of improvements of data rate, flexibility and coverage area. The MIMO system developed here combines Hadamard training sequences and the traditional Hermes uplink message. Key to proper MIMO communications is an accurate channel least-square estimation and equalization. A MIMO equalization process consisting of a matrix-based linear filter optimized under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is presented here. The channel estimation technique is evaluated using simulated messages generated by a very shallow water Rician channel model. Simulation results indicate that a fading channel can be estimated with an RMSE of 0.191% on average at 75m under realistic conditions. In the sole presence of specular reflections, the mean value of the root mean square error (RMSE) is 94.59% before equalization and 32.26% after equalization. The variance of the RMSE is 32.014% before equalization and 12.77% after equalization, respectively. In the presence of sound scattering and using every echo, the mean value of the RMSE is 54.27% after equalization, vs. 120.55% before equalization.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06106943.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6106943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6106943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6106943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A channel model and estimation technique for MIMO underwater acoustic communications in ports and very shallow waters at very high frequencies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Sea surface","Receivers","Reflection","Estimation","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","Hadamard transforms","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO underwater acoustic communications","ports","shallow waters","Hadamard training sequences","Hermes uplink message","channel least-square estimation","channel equalization","MIMO equalization process","matrix-based linear filter","minimum mean square error","channel estimation technique","fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic","Modem","MIMO","High Frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6106943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A channel model and estimation technique for MIMO underwater acoustic communications in ports and very shallow waters at very high frequencies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6106943/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12458920","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A channel model and estimation technique for MIMO underwater acoustic communications in ports and very shallow waters at very high frequencies","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110415009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112132S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6106943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107045,"authors":[{"name":"Kelvin Yeo","affiliation":["Acoustic Research Laboratory, Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kelvin","lastName":"Yeo","id":"37595564800"},{"name":"Konstantinos Pelekanakis","affiliation":["Acoustic Research Laboratory, Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Pelekanakis","id":"37887727000"},{"name":"Mandar Chitre","affiliation":["Acoustic Research Laboratory, Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mandar","lastName":"Chitre","id":"37400178500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-39-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1427-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6107045","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Decision feedback equalizers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic OFDM systems","cyclic prefix","shallow water channels","bandwidth efficiency","time domain channel shortening equalizer","fast Fourier transform","channel impulse response","minimum mean square error unit tap constraint","unit energy constraint","maximum shortening signal to noise ratio","minimum inter symbol interference","frequency domain decision feedback equalizer","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"Single Input Single Output (SISO) Orthogonal Frequency Division-Multiplexing (OFDM) over short to medium range shallow water channels suffers from low bandwidth efficiency. This happens due to large Cyclic Prefix (CP) and relative small number of sub-carriers. To increase the bandwidth efficiency, a time domain channel shortening equalizer (CSE) can be inserted before the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The CSE shortens the channel impulse response (CIR) so that a smaller CP is needed. This paper analyses the performance of four time domain CSEs: 1) Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Unit Tap Constraint (UTC) 2) MMSE Unit Energy Constraint (UEC) 3) Maximum Shortening Signal to Noise Ratio (MSSNR) 4) Minimum Inter Symbol Interference (Min ISI) and Frequency Domain Decision Feedback Equalizer (FD-DFE). Analysing simulated and real data, the MMSE UTC equalizer shows the best performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). When bit-loading is applied, the BER of Min ISI approach has comparable performance to UTC.","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107045","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain equalization for underwater acoustic OFDM systems with insufficient Cyclic Prefix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain equalization for underwater acoustic OFDM systems with insufficient Cyclic Prefix","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107045/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12459018","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain equalization for underwater acoustic OFDM systems with insufficient Cyclic Prefix","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074439S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107068,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-Jean Bouvet","affiliation":["Underwater Acoustics Laboratory, I.S.E.N, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Pierre-Jean","lastName":"Bouvet","id":"37270330700"},{"name":"Alain Loussert","affiliation":["Underwater Acoustics Laboratory, I.S.E.N, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Loussert","id":"37601771100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-39-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1427-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6107068","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Underwater acoustics","Channel estimation","Channel capacity","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","shallow water acoustic communication","multiinput multioutput technique","underwater acoustic communication","bandwidth limitation","under-sea channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM modulation","spectral efficiency","frequency fading","equalizer structure","SWA channel","channel characteristics","OFDM parameter"]}],"abstract":"Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) techniques are currently extensively considered in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications to overcome the bandwidth limitation of under-sea channel.

Although piezoelectric single crystals (typically the compositions PMN-PT or PZN-PT [Jaffe et al., 1971 ] are high-performance materials (high yields), but are difficult to manufacture maintaining homogeneous properties in large areas. To overcome this problem, this article will be conducted with the use of a finite-element code (ATILA) in order to model the electrical comportment of single crystal transducer. The main objective is to consider the evolution of these characteristics when different parameters change, as modification of the thickness or of the material, addition of a fluid domain ... In article, to show the good performance of our approach, we performed an admittance comparison versus all parameter modifications. The results confirm the good fit between our optimized models and experimental results.","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107085","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107085.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of single crystal comportment by FEM Code ATILA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107085/","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of single crystal comportment by FEM Code ATILA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12459057","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107085/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of single crystal comportment by FEM Code ATILA","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054211S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6107099,"authors":[{"name":"Longbao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Longbao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37600206000"},{"name":"Jun Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tao","id":"37399182100"},{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Eng, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yahong Rosa","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38184497400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-39-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1427-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6107099","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","MIMO","Channel estimation","Parity check codes","Modulation","Decoding","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain turbo equalization","single-carrier MIMO underwater acoustic communications","low detection complexity","high transmission efficiency","received data stream","frequency-domain equalization","interblock-interference cancellation","soft symbol estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a frequency-domain turbo detection scheme for single-carrier, multiple-input, multiple output (MIMO) underwater acoustic (UWA) transmission without using cyclic prefix (CP), aiming to achieve a low detection complexity and a high transmission efficiency simultaneously. The received data stream is divided into consecutive blocks, and each block is equalized in the frequency domain. To enable the frequency-domain equalization, inter-block-interference (IBI) cancellation and CP reconstruction are necessary for each block. The IBI is removed by using the currently estimated channel and the detected symbols from the previous block. The CP reconstruction for the current iteration of the turbo equalization is obtained with the soft symbol estimation from the previous iteration. In the first iteration, there is no a priori soft symbol estimation available, thus the frequency-domain equalizer (FDE) is performed in an approximating style. The detection performance improves over iterations. The proposed scheme has been tested by field trial data measured in the ACOMM09 underwater communication experiment.","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107099","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107099.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency domain turbo equalization for No-CP single-carrier MIMO underwater acoustic communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency domain turbo equalization for No-CP single-carrier MIMO underwater acoustic communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107099/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12459071","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107099/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency domain turbo equalization for No-CP single-carrier MIMO underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048436S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107108,"authors":[{"name":"Christian R.

ICI can be estimated and mitigated using an appropriate channel model, but in turn leads to even further increased demand on pilot overhead. While sparse channel estimation can alleviate this challenge, pilot resources for channel estimation are always a precious commodity. We therefore study iterative receivers that feed back tentative or soft symbol decisions from error correction to be used as additional pilots in the next iteration of channel estimation. The key point is that this can be coupled with sparse channel estimation and that the uncertainty in soft decisions is modeled accurately. We use an experimentally recorded data set to compare the performance of sparse and conventional channel estimators under varying pilot overhead. We find that when increasing the pilot overhead - at the cost of reduced data rate - the performance saturates at some point. This point varies depending on if ICI is estimated or not, and is reached much earlier when using iterative receivers.","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107108","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of pilot overhead for iterative OFDM receivers on time-varying and sparse underwater acoustic channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study of pilot overhead for iterative OFDM receivers on time-varying and sparse underwater acoustic channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107108/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12470410","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107108/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of pilot overhead for iterative OFDM receivers on time-varying and sparse underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097449S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107112,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas O'Donoughue","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"O'Donoughue","id":"37391910900"},{"name":"Christian R.

Doppler effects necessitate short block lengths, so that the channel can be approximated as time-invariant, while large delay spreads require long guard intervals to prevent inter-symbol interference. Channel shortening can be used to alleviate this double bind by compressing the received channel and reducing the effective delay spread. Two simple shortening filters are the Time Reversal (TR) and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) filters. The MMSE filter is a well-studied equalizer, but leads to very long filter lengths. The TR filter is very simple to compute and results in a short filter length, but does not achieve sufficient shortening in sparse UWA channels with a single receive phone. We propose a hybrid approach between these two algorithms, based on the fact that the MMSE filter converges to the TR filter for increasing noise level. By artificially increasing the assumed noise level, we can tune this Hybrid MMSE filter to provide a tradeoff between the performance of the MMSE filter and the simplicity of the TR filter. We perform a series of numerical simulations to show that, for a single-input single-output UWA multicarrier system, the Hybrid MMSE filter can be tuned to provide a shortening filter of fixed length that outperforms both the regular MMSE and TR shortening filters.","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107112","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107112.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid MMSE approach to channel shortening for underwater acoustic OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107112/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid MMSE approach to channel shortening for underwater acoustic OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12470414","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107112/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid MMSE approach to channel shortening for underwater acoustic OFDM","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1198S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107159,"authors":[{"name":"Nicol\u00f2 Michelusi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicol\u00f2","lastName":"Michelusi","id":"37847389900"},{"name":"Beatrice Tomasi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Beatrice","lastName":"Tomasi","id":"37571593100"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"},{"name":"James Preisig","affiliation":["Department of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, MA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Preisig","id":"37283317600"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37278668800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-39-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1427-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6107159","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Delay","Receivers","Vectors","Accuracy","Sea surface","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","transmitters","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic channel estimation","hybrid sparse-diffuse channel representation","SPACE08 experimental data set","exponential power delay profile","diffuse component","transmitter"]}],"abstract":"The underwater acoustic channel has been usually modeled as sparse. However, in some scenarios of interest, e.g., shallow water environments due to the interaction with the surface and the seabed, the channel exhibits also a dense arrival of multipath components. In these cases, a Hybrid Sparse/Diffuse (HSD) channel representation, rather than a purely sparse one, may be more appropriate. In this work, we present the HSD channel model and channel estimators based on it. We evaluate these estimation strategies on the SPACE08 experimental data set. We show that the HSD estimators outperform the more conventional purely sparse and least squares estimators. Moreover, we show that an exponential Power Delay Profile (PDP) for the diffuse component is appropriate in scenarios where the receiver is far away from the transmitter. Finally, the HSD estimators and the exponential PDP model are shown to be robust even in scenarios where the channel does not exhibit a diffuse component.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107159.pdf","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of the hybrid sparse/diffuse algorithm for underwater acoustic channel estimation","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107159","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of the hybrid sparse/diffuse algorithm for underwater acoustic channel estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107159/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12470454","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107159/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of the hybrid sparse/diffuse algorithm for underwater acoustic channel estimation","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056626S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6107169,"authors":[{"name":"Tang Jiansheng","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Underwater Acoustic Antagonizing Laboratory, China State Shipbuilding Corporation Systems Engineering Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tang Jiansheng","id":"37567905800"},{"name":"Huangfu Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Underwater Acoustic Antagonizing Laboratory, China State Shipbuilding Corporation Systems Engineering Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Huangfu Li","id":"37579178700"},{"name":"Pan Yue","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Underwater Acoustic Antagonizing Laboratory, China State Shipbuilding Corporation Systems Engineering Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Pan Yue","id":"37288514300"},{"name":"Wang Yonggang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Underwater Acoustic Antagonizing Laboratory, China State Shipbuilding Corporation Systems Engineering Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Yonggang","id":"37398018500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-39-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1427-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6107169","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Noise","Interference","Covariance matrix","Arrays","Array signal processing","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","FIR filters","interference suppression","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiated noise assessment","frequency invariant beamformer","sensor array","interference signal suppression","generalised sidelobe canceller structure","null broadening technique","FIR fan filter","time domain","continuous signal wave","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["moving target","radiated noise","assessement","gneralised sidelobe canceller","frequency invariant beamformer","null broadening"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107169","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107169","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of assessment the target's radiated noise in the presence of target motion using the sensor array.

Performances of these three methods are evaluated by extensive numerical simulations and by data sets collected from the Mobile Acoustic Communication Experiment conducted off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, MA, July 23, 2010. Simulation results show that the Y-G algorithm always outperforms the O-M algorithm. As far as the fractional part of CFO is concerned, the Y-G algorithm can perform as good as the null subcarrier based method yet with a much lower computational complexity. When working with real data, the Y-G algorithm needs to be modified and integer CFO estimation based on a few null subcarriers is incorporated. Experimental results show that the modified Y-G algorithm, having lower complexity, performs slightly worse than the null subcarrier based method for small and moderate-size constellations, and becomes ineffective for a large constellation.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107178.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind CFO estimation for zero-padded OFDM over underwater acoustic channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Decoding","Frequency domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Doppler shift","mobile communication","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind CFO estimation","underwater acoustic channels","blind carrier-frequency-offset estimators","residual Doppler shift","zero-padded OFDM transmissions","null subcarrier based method","O-M algorithm","Y-G algorithm","numerical simulations","data sets","mobile acoustic communication","Martha Vineyard","computational complexity","small-size constellations","moderate-size constellations","large constellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","zero-padded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ZP-OFDM)","underwater acoustic communications (UWA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Blind CFO estimation for zero-padded OFDM over underwater acoustic channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107178/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12470471","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind CFO estimation for zero-padded OFDM over underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08615S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6107184,"authors":[{"name":"Amirhossein Rafati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Rafati","id":"37705920600"},{"name":"Huang Lou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Lou","id":"37685488400"},{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yahong Rosa","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38184497400"},{"name":"Chengshan Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Chengshan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37280816900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-39-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1427-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6107184","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"abstract":"In this paper, A low-complexity turbo detection scheme is proposed for single-carrier multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) underwater acoustic (UWA) communications that employs low-density parity-check (LDPC) channel coding. The proposed iterative soft feedback equalization (SFE) algorithm offers a novel approach to combating error propagation by utilizing the past soft decisions to mitigate inter-symbol interference. In addition, its computational complexity grows only linearly with the number of equalizer coefficients, compared to the quadratic complexity of minimum mean square error-based linear turbo equalizer. Performance of the proposed detection scheme is verified through experimental data collected in MACE10. Experimental results show that it provides robust detection and improved Bit Error Rate (BER) for MIMO UWA communications with different modulations schemes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Equalizers","Underwater acoustics","Phase shift keying","Sonar equipment","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","communication complexity","error statistics","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","MIMO communication","modulation","parity check codes","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft feedback turbo equalization","underwater acoustic communication","low-complexity turbo detection scheme","single-carrier multiple-input multiple output communication","low-density parity-check channel coding","iterative soft feedback equalization algorithm","error propagation","intersymbol interference mitigation","computational complexity","MACE10","bit error rate","modulations scheme"]}],"doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107184","publicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","pdfPath":"/iel5/6093765/6106891/06107184.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft feedback turbo equalization for underwater acoustic communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Soft feedback turbo equalization for underwater acoustic communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107184/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107184/","accessionNumber":"12470476","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft feedback turbo equalization for underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"110422224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063267S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6093765","isNumber":"6106891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6093765","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6106891","articleId":"6107184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107197,"authors":[{"name":"Yongjune Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongjune","lastName":"Kim","id":"38240744500"},{"name":"Il-Suek Koh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Il-Suek","lastName":"Koh","id":"37276735500"},{"name":"Yongshik Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongshik","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281123200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-39-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1427-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6107197","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"abstract":"This paper proposes a new normal mode algorithm based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) scheme.

In this paper a framework to relieve mobile devices from executing heavier multimedia and security algorithms in delivering mobile health services is described. The proposed framework uses a Cloud Computing protocol management model, which intends to provide multimedia sensor signal processing, secure storage as a service to mobile devices. The approach in this paper is to model the mobile cloud computing process in a 3GPP IMS software development and emulator environment. And show that multimedia and security operations can be performed in the cloud, allowing mobile service providers to subscribe and extend the capabilities of their mobile applications beyond the existing mobile device limitations.

In the Information Set (IS) decoding a collection of information sets are used to generate candidate codewords. The procedure then selects as the decoded codeword the one which is closest to the received sequence. This decoding approach can reduces the complexity and time processing in comparison to maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), and may presents the same decoding level. The performance of the IS algorithm depends on the number of error patterns that the collection of information sets can cover. There are no known constructive procedures for finding optimum collection of information sets. This paper presents an approach for obtaining optimum collections of information sets using genetic algorithms. Using this approach we found, in short time, collections of information sets with high covering capacity. Results from computer simulation show that the performance of the IS algorithm with optimized collections is nearly identical to the maximum-likelihood decoding.","doi":"10.1109/LatinCOM.2011.6107391","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095475/6106804/06107391.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third Latin-American Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LatinCOM.2011.6107391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying genetic algorithms to the information sets search problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Block codes","Search problems","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","digital communication","error correction codes","genetic algorithms","maximum likelihood decoding","reliability","search problems","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","information sets search problem","error-correction coding","signal processing technique","digital communication systems","information set decoding","candidate codeword generation","maximum-likelihood decoding","computer simulation","IS algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error Correcting Codes","Soft-Decision Decoding","Information Set Decoding","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Applying genetic algorithms to the information sets search problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441502","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying genetic algorithms to the information sets search problem","confLoc":"Belem, Brazil","sourcePdf":"89231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049882S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095475","isNumber":"6106804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095475","xplore-issue":"6106804","articleId":"6107391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6107392,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Diagonal loading is one of the most widely used and effective methods to improve robustness of adaptive beamformers.

The techniques do not use a pre-steered array and allow an array designer to specify the frequency response of the processor in the look direction and steered the main beam of specified frequency response in an arbitrary direction. The proposed techniques are computationally efficient. The techniques used in the paper extend two previously published techniques used for narrow band beamforming to broadband beamforming.

This proposal is based on the usage of an OFDM signal obtained from an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) calculation with double length, compared to conventional OFDM systems. Since an OFDM signal is composed by the concatenation of individual OFDM symbols, continuity is implicitly obtained in half of all the union points of the whole transmission. A cyclic prefix and cyclic suffix strategy is also presented, to accommodate the obtained signal without affecting the original bandwidth or the sampling rate of the communication, but considering different channel states. Obtained results show a reduction in the out-of-band power emission. Since the output signal can be digitally obtained, the proposed approach is suitable for applications such as software defined radio (SDR) and cognitive radio (CR).","doi":"10.1109/LatinCOM.2011.6107421","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third Latin-American Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095475/6106804/06107421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LatinCOM.2011.6107421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106804","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Out-of-band power reduction in OFDM systems using double-length symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Out-of-band power reduction in OFDM systems using double-length symbols","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107421/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441532","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107421/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Out-of-band power reduction in OFDM systems using double-length symbols","confLoc":"Belem, Brazil","sourcePdf":"90906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087781S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095475","isNumber":"6106804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095475","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6106804","articleId":"6107421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6107422,"authors":[{"name":"B\u00e1rbara Dumas","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"B\u00e1rbara","lastName":"Dumas","id":"38241509400"},{"name":"Diego Acevedo","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Acevedo","id":"38061234000"},{"name":"Alejandra Beghelli","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile","Optical Networks Group, Electronic & Electrical Engineering Department, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Alejandra","lastName":"Beghelli","id":"37317936400"},{"name":"Ricardo Olivares","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Olivares","id":"37395926600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0279-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0277-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0278-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"6107422","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"abstract":"A dynamic lightpath allocation algorithm that considers the impact of Raman amplification on the quality of the signal is proposed. To do so, an exhaustive theoretical model that includes fiber attenuation, Rayleigh scattering, stimulated Raman scattering (gain and depletion of channels and pumps) and spontaneous Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering caused by Distributed Fiber Raman Amplifiers (DFRAs) is used to quantify the Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) of the lightpaths found by the lightpath allocation algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated by means of computer simulation. Results show that, due to the rigorous modeling of the Raman amplification, the blocking probability of the proposed lightpath algorithm can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of classical Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithms or previous OSNR-aware algorithms applying a much simpler model for the signal power propagation of DFRAs. We expect these results help network operators to better design and operate their future Raman-amplified dynamic networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Optical noise","Signal to noise ratio","Optical fiber networks","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication equipment","optical fibre losses","optical fibre networks","Raman spectra","Rayleigh scattering","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OSNR aware dynamic lightpath allocation","Raman amplified networks","dynamic lightpath allocation algorithm","Raman amplification","signal quality","fiber attenuation","Rayleigh scattering","stimulated Raman scattering","spontaneous Stokes scattering","anti-Stokes scattering","distributed fiber Raman amplifiers","optical signal to noise ratio","lightpath algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lightpath allocation","OSNR","DFRAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LatinCOM.2011.6107422","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third Latin-American Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095475/6106804/06107422.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LatinCOM.2011.6107422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OSNR-aware dynamic lightpath allocation in Raman-amplified networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OSNR-aware dynamic lightpath allocation in Raman-amplified networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107422/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107422/","accessionNumber":"12441533","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OSNR-aware dynamic lightpath allocation in Raman-amplified networks","confLoc":"Belem, Brazil","sourcePdf":"90907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04461S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095475","isNumber":"6106804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095475","xplore-issue":"6106804","articleId":"6107422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107430,"authors":[{"name":"Naveed Salman","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Naveed","lastName":"Salman","id":"37593175700"},{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37284467100"},{"name":"Andrew H.

Although the propagation model is difficult to characterize in uncertain environments, the majority of current studies assume to have exact knowledge of the path-loss exponent (PLE).

First, we derive an analytical expression for the mean square error on location estimates for incorrect PLE assumption and examine, via simulation, the effects of error in the PLE on the location accuracy. Second, we enhance a previously proposed RSS-PLE joint estimator (JE) by reducing its complexity. We also propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator by considering the PLE as an unknown random variable. Finally, we derive the Hybrid Cramer Rao Bound (HCRB) as a benchmark for the MAP estimator. Error analysis results predict large error due to incorrect PLE assumption which are in agreement with the simulation results. Further simulations show that the MAP estimator exhibits better performance at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and that the relation between the HCRB and CRB depends on the network geometry.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Joint Estimation of the RSS-Based Location and Path-loss Exponent","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.121411.110059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6150268/06107430.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.121411.110059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107430/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Joint Estimation of the RSS-Based Location and Path-loss Exponent","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6107430/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12527301","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Joint Estimation of the RSS-Based Location and Path-loss Exponent","sourcePdf":"034-wcl1202-salman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065339S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6150268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6150268","articleId":"6107430","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6107431,"authors":[{"name":"Weiliang Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiliang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37529862200"},{"name":"Chengshan Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Chengshan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37280816900"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6107431","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Phase shift keying","Fading","Vectors","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","fading channels","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity design","linear precoding","finite-alphabet inputs","multiple-input multiple-output","finite-alphabet inputs","fading MIMO channels","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear precoder","finite-alphabet inputs","mutual information maximization","low-complexity design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107431","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6150268/06107431.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.121411.110025","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.121411.110025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity Design of Linear Precoding for MIMO Channels with Finite-Alphabet Inputs","abstract":"This paper investigates linear precoding scheme that maximizes mutual information for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels with finite-alphabet inputs.

However, DWDM gives rise to severe physical impairments that adversely affect system performance. To mitigate various physical impairments in DWDM systems and exploit their system capacity, there is a need to develop a 2-D (time and wavelength) discrete-time input-output model of physical impairments that can become the foundation of signal processing for optical communications. This paper develops such a model based on the Volterra series transfer function (VSTF) method. We overcome the well-known triple integral problem associated with the VSTF method and reduce it to a simple integral. This model takes into account multiple channel effects, fiber losses, frequency chirp, optical filtering, and photo detection, which are ignored in the current literature. The model is in excellent agreement with results obtained by split-step Fourier simulation. Furthermore, with this model, we define coefficients that capture intersymbol interference, interchannel interference, self-phase modulation, intrachannel cross-phase modulation (XPM), intrachannel four-wave mixing (FWM), XPM, and FWM to characterize the impact of these effects individually on the system performance. We also apply this model to analyze the effects of varying system parameters and pulse shapes on the individual physical impairments.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2180360","publicationTitle":"Journal of

expected to significantly improve the overall spectrum efficiency with respect to traditional networks where fixed frequency spacing is applied. Flexible optical networks will exploit the BV-OXC capability to dynamically configure the reserved bandwidth as a set of frequency slots. In addition, flexible transponders will be employed to dynamically configure transmission parameters, such as bit-rate and modulation format. To enable these new configuration capabilities, network operation enhancements need to be efficiently introduced and investigated. In this study, we focus for the first time on the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture for flexible optical networks. PCE architecture and PCE communication protocol are enhanced to maximize the spectral efficiency and to provide indications also on the specific transmission parameters to configure. Experimental demonstration is provided through two different experiments, successfully showing the PCE capability to trigger dynamic rerouting with bit-rate or modulation format adaptation. In particular, the experiments demonstrate, in a real testbed, dynamic frequency slot assignment and format adaptation from DP-16QAM to DP-QPSK at 100 Gb/s, and bit-rate adaptation at DP-16QAM from 200 Gb/s to 100 Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2180361","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6145447/06107508.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2180361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145447","startPage":"727","endPage":"733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of Flexible Optical Network Based on Path Computation Element","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of Flexible Optical Network Based on Path Computation Element","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107508/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2012","accessionNumber":"12524426","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6107508/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of Flexible Optical Network Based on Path Computation Element","sourcePdf":"jlt-cugini-2180361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079838S","chronDate":"March1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6145447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6145447","articleId":"6107508","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6107522,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Xing An","affiliation":["Department of Information Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Wen Xing","lastName":"An","id":"37602998400"},{"name":"Hang Wong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Wong","id":"37280423700"},{"name":"Ka Leung Lau","affiliation":["Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Ka Leung","lastName":"Lau","id":"37275224600"},{"name":"Shu Fang Li","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shu Fang","lastName":"Li","id":"37537870400"},{"name":"Quan Xue","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37280402500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6107522","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6353},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Broadband antennas","Dual band","Wideband","Antenna radiation patterns","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","dipole antennas","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband dual-band dipole","base station antenna","dual-band unidirectional antenna","planar dipole elements","irregular-shorted patch","L-shaped feeding strip","V-slot","capacitive loading","dual-band impedance bandwidths","radiation characteristic","radiation modes","back-lobe radiation","cross-polarization","symmetric radiation pattern","frequency 0.78 GHz to 1.1 GHz","frequency 1.58 GHz to 2.62 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Base station antenna","dipole","dual-band","L-probe","magneto electric dipole","shorted patch","V-slot","wideband"]}],"abstract":"A novel dual-band unidirectional antenna composed of an irregular shorted patch and planar dipole elements is presented and studied.

The array is optimally designed to be used as a feeder in mobile satellite terminals with a hybrid antenna (HA) structure, but it can be also used independently as a phased array. The array has an oval-shaped rim to maximize the efficiency of the HA, and is composed of 20 horn elements in a hexagonal structure. The element has a horn radiator with a conical helix, which is placed inside the horn and excited by two ports for TX and RX at both ends. Therefore, the antenna can be simultaneously operational in the Ka-band TX and K-band RX frequency bands, using a compact structure providing left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) for TX and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) for RX. The fabricated array is connected with active channel modules having 20 channels each for TX and RX, and it was experimented on within a beam scanning range of -5\u00b0 to +5\u00b0 in the azimuth and elevation directions using phase control of the ac tive channel module. The antenna has a minimum gain of 21.7 dBi over the TX band and 19.7 dBi over the RX band over the desired scan region. The maximum pointing error is about 0.32\u00b0 and the pointing loss is approximately 1.3 dB.

Channel modeling was performed for delay domain multipath characteristics based on extensive radio channel measurement campaigns in angiography and ultrasonic inspection rooms. The measurement results revealed that the shapes of the power delay profiles in the angiography and ultrasonic imaging rooms were significantly different from that reported in the IEEE802.15 TG3c and IEEE802.11 TGad channel models. For this reason, novel model structures were developed to model radio channels in these hospital scenarios accurately. Statistical descriptions of the channel model parameters are given based on the measurements, and, finally, implementation guidelines of the channel models are provided. The channel model validation results show a good agreement of root-mean-square delay spread between channel model outputs and channel measurements.

To reduce the cost and power consumption, it employs the structure of an Electronically Steerable Parasitic Array Radiator (ESPAR) antenna. To reduce the size of the antenna, a top-disk loaded monopole and six folded monopoles are employed as the driven element and parasitic elements, respectively. The proposed antenna is called \u201cfolded monopole ESPAR antenna\u201d. The heights of the top-disk loaded monopole and folded monopoles are reduced to be less than . Furthermore, the radius of the folded monopole ESPAR antenna is reduced by using capacitive loading technique. An equivalent circuit model is proposed for analyzing the antenna. To validate the concept, a prototype is developed and the antenna operates from 2.3 GHz to 2.55 GHz. The measured results confirm that the folded monopole ESPAR antenna can achieve electronically beam scanning in horizontal plane over a 360 range. The prototype antenna achieves a gain of 4.0 dBi and a front-back ratio of 20 dB. The parasitic elements are loaded by varactors and beam forming is achieved by controlling the DC voltages applied to the varactors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571312","htmlLink":"/document/6107540/","displayDocTitle":"Electrically Small and Low Cost Smart Antenna for Wireless Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrically Small and Low Cost Smart Antenna for Wireless Communication","sourcePdf":"tap-liu-2180300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081543S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6159229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6159229","articleId":"6107540","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6107542,"authors":[{"name":"Said M.

The method does not require solving Maxwell's equations under the customary boundary condition, but is based instead on searching for equivalent dipole models that are capable of reproducing the same radiated fields of the actual array (ideally obtained through accurate measurement.) We treat mutual coupling between array elements as essentially a multiple scattering effect and propose a method to calculate the near field of arbitrary linear arrays with significant electromagnetic coupling. It is found that a single (analytical) dipole model obtained under certain circumstances, which are detailed in the paper, can be used to predict correctly the near field radiated by arbitrary-size antenna arrays. The paper ends by developing an application of the equivalent dipole method by expanding the near fields into a sum of propagating and nonpropagating parts. It is shown that the 3-D spatial Fourier transform required in this expansion can be eliminated when the dipole model is used in computing the near field in the domain of the validity of the model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Field Analysis of Electromagnetic Interactions in Antenna Arrays Through Equivalent Dipole Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2180318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6159229/06107542.pdf","startPage":"1381","endPage":"1389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2180318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Near-Field Analysis of Electromagnetic Interactions in Antenna Arrays Through Equivalent Dipole Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6107542/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571314","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Field Analysis of Electromagnetic Interactions in Antenna Arrays Through Equivalent Dipole Models","sourcePdf":"tap-mikki-2180318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087861S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6159229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6159229","articleId":"6107542","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6107545,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis T.

The main difficulty in FDTD implementations for such media is the appearance of fractional derivatives in the time-domain polarization relation. To circumvent this difficulty, the relative complex permittivity of the medium is approximated by Pad\u00e9 approximants resulting in auxiliary differential equations of integer order. Moreover, it is proven that under certain conditions the Pad\u00e9 approximation is equivalent to one given by a sum of Debye terms. Hence, an alternative set of auxiliary differential equations is derived. Over a wideband frequency domain, the comparisons between analytical and calculated values of the relative complex permittivity as well as of the transfer function inside the dispersive medium illustrate the efficiency of both FDTD schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2180348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6159229/06107545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2180348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159229","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Schemes for Wave Propagation in Davidson-Cole Dispersive Media Using Auxiliary Differential Equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Schemes for Wave Propagation in Davidson-Cole Dispersive Media Using Auxiliary Differential Equations","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571317","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6107545/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Schemes for Wave Propagation in Davidson-Cole Dispersive Media Using Auxiliary Differential Equations","sourcePdf":"tap-rekanos-2180348-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083077S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6159229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6159229","articleId":"6107545","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6107548,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Q.

This brief presents a power-efficient noise-suppression technique that excludes the signal from a noise-suppression loop by nulling the signal swing in transconductance cells.

One is an radio-frequency low-noise amplifier (LNA) with the noise figure improved from 5 to 4 dB. The other is a baseband variable-gain amplifier (VGA) with an 11-dB noise reduction. The power overheads for applying the technique in the LNA and the VGA are 0.56 and 0.19 mW, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Radio frequency","Transconductance","Gain","Wideband","Baseband","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","low noise amplifiers","power consumption","radiofrequency amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-noise wideband amplifiers","power-efficient noise suppression","signal-nulled feedback","power consumption","noise-suppression loop","signal swing","transconductance cells","signal linearity","power constraint","loop gain stage","radio-frequency low-noise amplifier","baseband variable-gain amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier","feedback","low noise","noise suppression","wideband"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2011.2177695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6129932/06107567.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2011.2177695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power-Efficient Noise Suppression Technique Using Signal-Nulled Feedback for Low-Noise Wideband Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Power-Efficient Noise Suppression Technique Using Signal-Nulled Feedback for Low-Noise Wideband Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107567/","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107567/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12472353","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power-Efficient Noise Suppression Technique Using Signal-Nulled Feedback for Low-Noise Wideband Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcsii-li-2177695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06663S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6129932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6129932","articleId":"6107567","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6107568,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Hui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Hui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406474600"},{"name":"Chien-Hung Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Hung","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37403619900"},{"name":"Sheng-Wen Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Wen","lastName":"Lai","id":"37530686800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6107568","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2275},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"A low-dropout (LDO) regulator with tail current control (TCC) is presented.

In this paper, a parallel adaptive finite-element method (AFEM) for capacitance extraction of large-scale interconnects (ParAFEMCap) is developed to provide extremely high parallel scalability and numerical accuracy. First, the proposed ParAFEMCap has the potential of high parallel scalability by taking advantages of several advanced parallel techniques, such as parallel adaptive mesh refinement and dynamic load balancing. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first capacitance extraction field solver that is able to run in parallel on hundreds and even thousands of CPU cores. Second, the proposed ParAFEMCap is based on the AFEM, which is proven to converge to the exact solution of the electromagnetic problems in a theoretically quasi-optimal rate. The solution precision of ParAFEMCap can easily be controlled by varying the threshold for the a posteriori error estimator, while the computational time can easily be reduced by increasing the number of CPU cores. Moreover, ParAFEMCap is shown to have the same linear computation complexity as those integral-equation methods, which make it very promising for capacitance extraction of large-scale interconnect problems. Numerical experiments will demonstrate that ParAFEMCap has the advantages of high computational efficiency and accuracy for solving the capacitance extraction problem of large-scale interconnects with complex multilayer structures.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2176137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6142663/06107602.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2176137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142663","startPage":"218","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ParAFEMCap: A Parallel Adaptive Finite-Element Method for 3-D VLSI Interconnect Capacitance Extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ParAFEMCap: A Parallel Adaptive Finite-Element Method for 3-D VLSI Interconnect Capacitance Extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12508838","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6107602/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ParAFEMCap: A Parallel Adaptive Finite-Element Method for 3-D VLSI Interconnect Capacitance Extraction","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhu-2176137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135866S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6142663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6142663","articleId":"6107602","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6107603,"authors":[{"name":"Souvik Sen","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6183048/6107603/6107603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Souvik Sen (S'11) received the B.E. degree in computer science from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Howrah, India, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in computer science from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2011, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science at Duke University.","His research interests include wireless networking and mobile computing."]},"firstName":"Souvik","lastName":"Sen","id":"37885015600"},{"name":"Romit Roy Choudhury","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6183048/6107603/6107603-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Romit Roy Choudhury (M'03\u2013SM'10) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 2006.","He is an Associate Professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science with Duke University, Durham, NC, which he in 2006 after completing his Ph.D. studies.

If the transmitter could detect the collision early [such as with carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) in wired networks], it could immediately abort its transmission, freeing the channel for useful communication. There are two main hurdles to realize CSMA/CD in wireless networks. First, a wireless transmitter cannot simultaneously transmit and listen for a collision. Second, any channel activity around the transmitter may not be an indicator of collision at the receiver. This paper attempts to approximate CSMA/CD in wireless networks with a novel scheme called CSMA/CN (collision notification). Under CSMA/CN, the receiver uses PHY-layer information to detect a collision and immediately notifies the transmitter. The collision notification consists of a unique signature, sent on the same channel as the data. The transmitter employs a listener antenna and performs signature correlation to discern this notification. Once discerned, the transmitter immediately aborts the transmission. We show that the notification signature can be reliably detected at the listener antenna, even in the presence of a strong self-interference from the transmit antenna. A prototype testbed of 10 USRP/GNU Radios demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of CSMA/CN.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6183048/06107603.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"556","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2174461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2174461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6183048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSMA/CN: Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Notification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Receivers","Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","collision avoidance","radio networks","radio transmitters","telecommunication congestion control","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","collision notification","wireless transmitter","packet loss","collision detection","CSMA-CD","wired networks","wireless networks","channel activity","CSMA-CN","PHY-layer information","listener antenna","signature correlation","notification signature","self-interference","transmit antenna","USRP radio","GNU radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collision detection","wireless communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"CSMA/CN: Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Notification","volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6107603/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12673854","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSMA/CN: Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Notification","sourcePdf":"tnet-nelakuditi-2174461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082267S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6183048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6183048","articleId":"6107603","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6107619,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In the literature, capacity analysis of systems with IQ imbalance has been done only for the single antenna case and has considered either frequency-flat IQ imbalances at both transmitter and receiver sides without CFO or only receiver-side IQ imbalances with CFO. Additionally, these works dealt with IQ imbalance by treating the mirror tone interference as an additional source of noise, which is not optimal. In this paper, we consider a generalized system model that includes a multi-antenna system with frequency-selective IQ imbalances at both the transmitter and the receiver sides, in addition to the presence of CFO, and perform capacity analysis considering joint detection of the signal and its self-interference. In addition, for the imperfect channel estimation case, existing works in the literature optimize for pilot spacings and pilot designs. Pilot-data power allocation is an additional degree of freedom that is available to further optimize the system and has not been addressed before. Therefore, we analyze the pilot-data power allocation that maximizes the capacity bound and obtain a closed-form solution for the optimal power allocation at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We then study how the IQ imbalance and residual CFO severity affect capacity, symbol error rate (SER), and capacity bound maximizing power allocation. Finally, we derive the optimal power allocation when the channel is slow varying and remains constant over a block of several OFDM symbols. The derived results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis and Pilot-Data Power Allocation for MIMO-OFDM With Transmitter and Receiver IQ Imbalances and Residual Carrier Frequency Offset","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2180030","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06107619.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2180030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107619/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis and Pilot-Data Power Allocation for MIMO-OFDM With Transmitter and Receiver IQ Imbalances and Residual Carrier Frequency Offset","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12527199","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis and Pilot-Data Power Allocation for MIMO-OFDM With Transmitter and Receiver IQ Imbalances and Residual Carrier Frequency Offset","sourcePdf":"tvt-gottumukkala-2180030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040919S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","articleId":"6107619","onlineDate":"16 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6107634,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Hua Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Hua","lastName":"Hong","id":"37401673100"},{"name":"Ming-Chun Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Chun","lastName":"Liang","id":"38064345300"},{"name":"Ming-Yang Haung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Yang","lastName":"Haung","id":"38234170900"},{"name":"Tsung-Heng Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Heng","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37573816800"},{"name":"Qiang Fang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Fang","id":"37271539500"},{"name":"Shuenn-Yuh Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shuenn-Yuh","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293419600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0077-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0076-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0075-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6107634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Modulation","Sensors","Noise","Low-noise amplifiers","Preamplifiers","Choppers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","capacitors","data acquisition","differential amplifiers","electroencephalography","feedforward","medical signal processing","resistors","sigma-delta modulation","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog front-end circuit","low noise amplifier","high-pass sigma-delta modulator","EEG","ECoG","signal acquisition systems","chopping techniques","HPSDM","AFE","electroencephalogram","electrocorticogram","differential difference amplifier","feedback pseudoresistors","capacitors","feedforward architecture","oversampling","power consumption","frequency 51.2 kHz","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1.2 V","power 28.7 muW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107634","abstract":"The present paper proposes an analog front-end (AFE) circuit, including only one low-noise amplifier with chopping techniques and one high-pass sigma-delta modulator (HPSDM), which can be applied as a sensing circuit for electroencephalogram or electrocorticogram (ECoG) signal acquisition systems.

A coordinator in a BAN plays a significant role to collect signals from sensors and interface with telecommunication networks. Since the wireless channel of BAN is very complicated and changeable, the modulation is not fixed. As a result, the coordinator must have different demodulators. In this paper, we propose a method to design a low-power circuit which can both demodulate BPSK and QPSK by using the technique of datapath merging. The results of the experiments show that the proposed demodulator implementation can reduce around 23% hardware area compared with the traditional implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ISBB.2011.6107691","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Bioelectronics and Bioinformations 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Bioelectronics and Bioinformations 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095468/6107621/06107691.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBB.2011.6107691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power circuit for BPSK and QPSK demodulation for body area networks applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107691/","displayDocTitle":"A low-power circuit for BPSK and QPSK demodulation for body area networks applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441374","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107691/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power circuit for BPSK and QPSK demodulation for body area networks applications","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"18930411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063745S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095468","isNumber":"6107621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095468","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6107621","articleId":"6107691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6107695,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Guan","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Guan","id":"37722766900"},{"name":"Zedong Nie","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zedong","lastName":"Nie","id":"37397419700"},{"name":"Wencheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Wencheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716329400"},{"name":"Tengfei Leng","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Tengfei","lastName":"Leng","id":"37720342600"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406752100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0077-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0076-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0075-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6107695","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Radio frequency","Resistors","Noise figure","Transceivers","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active noise control","amplifiers","biomedical engineering","body area networks","body sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifier","human body communication","RF front end design","SMIC process","Cadence Spectre simulation","channel pass band","attenuation","active noise cancellation","resistor feedback technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107695","doi":"10.1109/ISBB.2011.6107695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBB.2011.6107695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107621","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Bioelectronics and Bioinformations 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Bioelectronics and Bioinformations 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095468/6107621/06107695.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low noise amplifier for human body communication RF front-end design","abstract":"A Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) for Human Body Communication (HBC) RF front-end was presented in this paper.

Based on the principle of symbolic dynamics, the action potential sequences can be symbolized without high precision measurement. By computing the distance between symbolic sequences can analyze the degree of nearness between the two orbits, and then use dichotomy to find the optimal parameters. The longer the output spike sequence is, the higher precision estimation can be achieved. The proposed method is efficient for parameter estimation in unstable neural systems, and has a certain reference value for creating neural models from neural electrophysiological experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ISBB.2011.6107700","startPage":"275","endPage":"278","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Bioelectronics and Bioinformations 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095468/6107621/06107700.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Bioelectronics and Bioinformations 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBB.2011.6107700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation for coupling neural network models with symbolic dynamics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Neurons","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Parameter estimation","Biological neural networks","Electric potential"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","neural nets","neurophysiology","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","coupling neural network model","symbolic dynamics","interspike interval sequence","neuron output","ion channel parameters","action potential sequence","symbolic sequence","dichotomy","precision estimation","neural systems","neural electrophysiological experiment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation for coupling neural network models with symbolic dynamics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107700/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441383","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation for coupling neural network models with symbolic dynamics","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"18930420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065179S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095468","isNumber":"6107621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095468","xplore-issue":"6107621","articleId":"6107700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6107712,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Al-Ashmouny","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Integrated Microsystems (WIMS), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Al-Ashmouny","id":"38304200500"},{"name":"Sun-Il Chang","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Integrated Microsystems (WIMS), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sun-Il","lastName":"Chang","id":"37423686700"},{"name":"Euisik Yoon","affiliation":["Center of Wireless Integrated Microsystems (WIMS), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Euisik","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37275464600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1470-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1469-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1468-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6107712","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Probes","Capacitors","Gain","Arrays","Sorting","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","bioMEMS","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog front-end module","power-scalable sampling operation","3D neural recording microsystems","critical circuit","front-end features","low-noise amplifier","programmable-gain amplifier","asynchronous interface","data capturing","digital operation","noise-power-area reduction","power 4 muW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107712","abstract":"We report an analog front-end prototype designed for integration into 3-D neural recording microsystems.

Further, measured results from the FPGA verify that memory initialization with the first recorded artifact can speed up the IIR system operation significantly, and that the proposed architecture can eliminate virtually all stimulus artifacts from the recorded data in real time and recover the extracellular neural activity.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094292/6107704/06107724.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2011.6107724","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2011.6107724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of an IIR temporal filtering technique for real-time stimulus artifact rejection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of an IIR temporal filtering technique for real-time stimulus artifact rejection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107724/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107724/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442470","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of an IIR temporal filtering technique for real-time stimulus artifact rejection","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0135082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069788S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094292","isNumber":"6107704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094292","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6107704","articleId":"6107724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107727,"authors":[{"name":"Thoa Nguyen","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium","Department of Physics and Astronomy, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Thoa","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37089056190"},{"name":"Carmen Bartic","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Bartic","id":"37428717500"},{"name":"Wolfgang Eberle","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Eberle","id":"37270928400"},{"name":"Georges Gielen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Gielen","id":"37275184800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1470-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1469-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1468-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6107727","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Calibration","In vivo","Probes","Data acquisition","Biological neural networks","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","calibration","electroencephalography","medical control systems","medical signal processing","neural nets","neurophysiology","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated calibration system","in vivo neural network study","feedback control system","neuroprosthetic performance","clinical therapies","calibration process","electrophysiological state","hippocampus","stimulation voltage threshold","pulse repetition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107727","abstract":"A feedback control system promises improvements in neuroprosthetic performance and clinical therapies.

provide a powerful means both of understanding brain behavioral relations in the high dimensional world, and of assessing and treating a variety of neural disorders. Here we present a system that combines state-of-the-art, fully immersive, 3D, multi-modal VR with temporally aligned electro-physiological recordings. The VR system is dynamic and interactive across visual, auditory, and haptic interactions, providing sight, sound, touch, and force. The overall end-to-end latency between real movement and its simulated movement in the VR is approximately 40ms. Spatial precision of the various devices is on the order of millimeters. The temporal alignment with the neural recordings is accurate to within approximately 1ms. This powerful combination of systems opens up a new window into brain-behavioral relations and a new means of assessment and rehabilitation of individuals with motor and other disorders.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2011.6107736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107704","startPage":"98","endPage":"101","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094292/6107704/06107736.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous neural and movement recording in large-scale immersive virtual environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107736/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous neural and movement recording in large-scale immersive virtual environments","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442482","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous neural and movement recording in large-scale immersive virtual environments","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0255157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049048S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094292","isNumber":"6107704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094292","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6107704","articleId":"6107736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107742,"authors":[{"name":"Uei-Ming Jow","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Uei-Ming","lastName":"Jow","id":"37282665800"},{"name":"Mehdi Kiani","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Kiani","id":"37397488400"},{"name":"Xueliang Huo","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Xueliang","lastName":"Huo","id":"37586185200"},{"name":"Maysam Ghovanloo","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Maysam","lastName":"Ghovanloo","id":"37275363200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1470-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1469-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1468-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"6107742","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Animals","Mobile communication","Arrays","Couplings","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","bioelectric phenomena","biomedical communication","biomedical electronics","biomedical measurement","biosensors","coils","data communication","inductive power transmission","integrated circuits","magnetic sensors","neurophysiology","power supplies to apparatus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long term electrophysiology experiments","wireless power transmission","wireless data transmission","low power microelectronic devices","biosensors","stimulators","actuators","long term uninterrupted electrophysiology experiments","small freely behaving animal subjects","EnerCage","inductive power transmission","scalable overlapping hexagonal coil array","inductive link model","iterative optimization process","3D magnetic sensors","smart tracking algorithm","nonline of sight positioning","magnetic tracer","power management block","closed loop regulated inductive power delivery"]}],"abstract":"Advancements in wireless power and data transmission have raised the prospects of using a variety of low power microelectronic devices such as biosensors, stimulators, and actuators in long-term uninterrupted electrophysiology experiments on small freely behaving animal subjects in large experimental arenas. This paper presents our progress towards developing such a system, called the EnerCage. This system includes a stationary unit for inductive power transmission through a scalable array of overlapping hexagonal coils, which are optimized using an accurate inductive link model and an iterative optimization process. Furthermore, the EnerCage system is equipped with an array of 3-D magnetic sensors and a smart tracking algorithm for non-line-of-sight positioning of the animal subject. EnerCage also has a small mobile unit, which is either attached to or implanted in the subject's body. This unit includes a magnetic tracer and an efficient power management block, which is capable of closed-loop regulated inductive power delivery to the experimental device(s) of interest. An early prototype of the EnerCage system with six coils has been presented here. The coil array achieves a power efficiency of 17.8% at the worst-case horizontal misalignment of 42 mm (half of the coil radius) at a coupling distance of 70 mm with the mobile unit coil of 20 mm in radius.","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2011.6107742","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094292/6107704/06107742.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2011.6107742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107704","startPage":"121","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a smart experimental arena for long-term electrophysiology experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards a smart experimental arena for long-term electrophysiology experiments","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107742/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442488","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107742/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a smart experimental arena for long-term electrophysiology experiments","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0315195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062621S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094292","isNumber":"6107704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094292","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6107704","articleId":"6107742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107744,"authors":[{"name":"Daibashish Gangopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Daibashish","lastName":"Gangopadhyay","id":"37547051100"},{"name":"Emily G.

Switched-capacitor technique which enables controllable, more accurate and stable resistance has been used. Oscillation frequency can be easily controlled by the frequency of switching which is very useful for global change of oscillation frequency in an array of oscillators. SPICE simulation and dynamical systems analysis have shown that when used as a single oscillator, the proposed circuit is able to produce a phase response curve (PRC) close to the one of a lamprey central pattern generator (CPG) system. Applying averaging theory to the system of coupled oscillators, we obtain averaged H and G functions for unidirectional and bidirectional coupling cases. Analysis of these functions shows our circuit's superior capability to achieve fast entrained oscillation with sensory feedback and reach equilibrium even with high frequency mismatch.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Capacitors","Couplings","Resistors","Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain models","neural nets","nonlinear dynamical systems","oscillators","switched capacitor networks","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamical systems","silicon half center oscillator analysis","silicon half center oscillator design","oscillator circuit","central pattern generator systems","switched capacitor technique","oscillation frequency","switching frequency","oscillator array","SPICE simulation","dynamical system analysis","phase response curve","PRC","lamprey central pattern generator system","lamprey CPG system","averaging theory","coupled oscillator system"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS.2011.6107774","startPage":"249","endPage":"252","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094292/6107704/06107774.pdf","doi":"10.1109/BioCAS.2011.6107774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical systems: A tool for analysis and design of silicon half center oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamical systems: A tool for analysis and design of silicon half center oscillators","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12442520","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107774/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical systems: A tool for analysis and design of silicon half center oscillators","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0635048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051551S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094292","isNumber":"6107704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094292","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6107704","articleId":"6107774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6107775,"authors":[{"name":"Juan A.

In fact, it is shown that despite the limited input dynamic range and the un-modelled nonlinearities produced by the hardware cochlea, the discriminative information present in its spike patterns can potentially be sufficient for a task as complex as speaker-independent isolated keyword recognition.

The control and data signals used for programming the weights into the SRAM, as well as the standard input and output signals, are encoded using the AER representation. The device acts as a transceiver, both receiving Address-Events in input and transmitting them as output spikes.

This paper proposes a dilution/mixing method with high utilization of intermediate droplets for preparing biochemical samples of multiple target concentrations on DMFBs. It provides the first solution to the problem of generating samples of multiple target concentrations. Unlike prior work in which the preparation of droplets of multiple target concentrations has to be carried out sequentially, this proposed approach takes a global view and all the target concentrations are processed concurrently. In addition, this is also the first approach that minimizes the number of waste droplets by utilizing intermediate droplets. Finally, the number of mixing steps can be reduced, leading to reduced completion time for sample preparation. The number of waste droplets is minimized by reducing the number of intermediate concentrations produced during sample preparation. Usable intermediate droplets are subsequently utilized to further reduce wastage. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve up to 71% reduction in the number of waste droplets and up to 50% reduction in sample preparation time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107786/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107786/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12442532","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On-chip biochemical sample preparation using digital microfluidics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip biochemical sample preparation using digital microfluidics","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0755088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060284S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094292","isNumber":"6107704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094292","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6107704","articleId":"6107786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6107788,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Unfortunately, there are numerous examples of CBR detection systems being designed \u201cin a vacuum,\u201d without full consideration of threat and vulnerability assessments, or the proposed protection strategy and response plans that the detection system must support. The potential negative effects of this approach include systems that are excessively costly in the best case, and systems that fail to deliver the required detection performance while providing a false sense of security in the worst case. The solution to this problem is the application of systems engineering principles. As with any system, the critical foundation for the system design is requirements development. Requirements for CBR detection systems include, but are not limited to, the spectrum of threats to be detected, the required sensitivity and speed of detection for each threat, the allowable false alarm and false negative rates, and operations and maintenance (O&M) needs. The requirements form the basis of system architecture and component selection, and allow trade studies that support an optimal system design. The process continues through detailed system design and integration, and culminates with system commissioning, verification and validation, and O&M planning. This paper presents Battelle's systems engineering approach to CBR detection system design and discusses several aspects of detection systems including: (1) Similarities and differences between chemical, biological, and radiological detection systems (2) Difference in requirements for \u201cdetect to warn\u201d, \u201cdetect to protect\u201d, and \u201cdetect to treat\u201d strategies (3) Detector selection options (4) Architecture options such as sampling systems to cost-effectively increase coverage or response speed, and use of \u201corthogonal\u201d detectors or trigger and confirmatory detectors for false alarm reduction Also discussed are the role of modeling in requirements development and system design, as well as the importance of commissioning and testing to effective detection system performance.","doi":"10.1109/THS.2011.6107879","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095473/6107829/06107879.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2011.6107879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systems engineering approach to chemical biological and radiological detection system design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Systems engineering approach to chemical biological and radiological detection system design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441447","htmlLink":"/document/6107879/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systems engineering approach to chemical biological and radiological detection system design","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"050063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042908S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095473","isNumber":"6107829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095473","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6107829","articleId":"6107879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6107900,"authors":[{"name":"CaLynna Sorrells","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View A and M University, Texas A and M University System, Prairie View, TX, USA"],"firstName":"CaLynna","lastName":"Sorrells","id":"38234810600"},{"name":"Paul Potier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View A and M University, Texas A and M University System, Prairie View, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Potier","id":"38241584700"},{"name":"Lijun Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View A and M University, Texas A and M University System, Prairie View, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Qian","id":"37286871700"},{"name":"Xiangfang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangfang","lastName":"Li","id":"37311139400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1376-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1375-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6107900","dbTime":"50 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":593},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Routing","Sensors","Ad hoc networks","Physical layer","Routing protocols","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","statistical analysis","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous spectrum usage attack detection","cognitive radio wireless networks","mission-critical applications","military operations","disaster relief efforts","dynamic spectrum access","primary user emulation attacks","smart jammer","jam channels","anomalous spectrum usage attacks","security enhancement","attack mitigation","physical layer sensing","statistical analysis","information fusion","spectrum-aware split multipath routing","baseline routing"]}],"abstract":"In many mission-critical applications such as military operations or disaster relief efforts, wireless networks employing dynamic spectrum access enabled by cognitive radio technology gain popularity due to their high spectrum efficiency and interoperability. However, the use of cognitive radio further complicates the security problems in wireless networks and introduces additional challenges. For instance, an attacker may mimic the behavior of a licensed primary user and disrupt the communication strategy of opportunistic spectrum usage of cognitive radio nodes, known as Primary User Emulation Attacks. Another example is a smart jammer, who can scan the spectrum and jam channels selectively. A common characteristic of the attacks in both examples is that they cause anomalous spectrum usage and disrupt the dynamic spectrum access, thus we termed them Anomalous Spectrum Usage Attacks in the context of cognitive radio wireless networks. Anomalous Spectrum Usage Attacks are extremely difficult to detect. In order to address these challenges, we propose a cross-layer framework for security enhancement and attack mitigation. In addition to physical layer sensing, we also take advantage of statistical analysis of the routing information of multiple paths collected by the routing module at the network layer. Inference of congested areas due to spectrum shortage can be made by information fusion and the results from the inference module will be compared to prior knowledge of the primary users, and the suspicious spectrum shortage will be subject to selective auditing, where a manager such as a cluster head will poll more detailed data from the cognitive nodes locating near the suspicious area for further analysis. We use a spectrum-aware split multipath routing as a baseline routing for performance evaluation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/THS.2011.6107900","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095473/6107829/06107900.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2011.6107900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous spectrum usage attack detection in cognitive radio wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107900/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous spectrum usage attack detection in cognitive radio wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441468","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6107900/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous spectrum usage attack detection in cognitive radio wireless networks","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"074046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065268S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095473","isNumber":"6107829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095473","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6107829","articleId":"6107900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6107917,"authors":[{"name":"Rick Dove","affiliation":["Paradigm Shift International, Questa, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Rick","lastName":"Dove","id":"37720229100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1376-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1375-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1374-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6107917","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Feature extraction","Immune system","Computer architecture","Pattern matching","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","pattern matching","reconfigurable architectures","self-organising feature maps","set theory","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing resilient network sensing","very large scale anomaly detection","computational barrier","sparse subsets","total anomaly space","pattern memory capacity","pattern matching cycle time","single gang detector employment","pattern magnitude","reconfigurable massively parallel VLSI pattern matching processor chip","virtually unbounded number","anomalous behavior detection","cyber domain","false positive rate","questionable normal-behavior stability","continuous learning","normal behavior reprofiling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomalies","anomaly detection","artificial immune system","cortex","cortical hierarchy","packets","patterns","zero-day attacks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107917","doi":"10.1109/THS.2011.6107917","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","abstract":"Anomaly detection promises to find elements of abnormality in a field of data. Computational barriers constrain anomaly detection to sparse subsets of total anomaly space. Barriers manifest in three ways - conserving both pattern memory capacity and pattern matching cycle time, while closing off scalability. The research reported here has discovered and analyzed a technology to eliminate two of these barriers, memory capacity and cycle time, and by targeting implementation at a new VLSI pattern processor, eliminate the third scalability barrier. An example shows how 10 to the 15 patterns integrated as a single gang detector can be stored in 193 bytes of memory, with much larger pattern magnitudes practical as well. The architecture of the gang detector enables complete processing of all 10 to the 15 patterns in time determined by the number of features in a single pattern, rather than the total number of patterns. Scalability is provided by a reconfigurable massively parallel VLSI pattern-matching processor chip that can accommodate a virtually unbounded number of such gang detectors. Anomalous behavior detection promises a way round the limitations of looking only for known attack patterns, but it raises new issues in the cyber domain of higher false positive rates and questionable normal-behavior stability. Work reported in this paper describes the nature and capability of gang detector employment, and suggests that the traditional issues of anomaly detection can be addressed with an architecture that engages in continuous learning and re-profiling of normal behavior, and employs a sensemaking hierarchy to reduce false positives. The architecture is based on process patterns from the biological immune system combined with process patterns of mammalian cortical hierarchical sensemaking.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2011.6107917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107829","startPage":"487","endPage":"493","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095473/6107829/06107917.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing resilient network sensing (SornS) with very large scale anomaly detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6107917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6107917/","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing resilient network sensing (SornS) with very large scale anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441485","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing resilient network sensing (SornS) with very large scale anomaly detection","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"093158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044404S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095473","isNumber":"6107829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095473","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6107829","articleId":"6107917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6107948,"authors":[{"name":"Ghulam Abbas","affiliation":["Lyon Institute of Nanotechnology (INL), CPE Lyon, University of Lyon I, France"],"firstName":"Ghulam","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37603074400"},{"name":"Umar Farooq","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umar","lastName":"Farooq","id":"37397450300"},{"name":"Muhammad Usman Asad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Usman","lastName":"Asad","id":"37393651100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0095-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-5327"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5335"}],"articleNumber":"6107948","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6107948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural network based model predictive controller to power switching converters","abstract":"Neural network based Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for a dc-dc buck converter working in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) is presented.

However, burstiness in user demands often dramatically degrades the application performance. In order to satisfy peak user demands and meet Service Level Agreement (SLA), efficient resource allocation schemes are highly demanded in the cloud. However, we find that conventional load balancers unfortunately neglect cases of bursty arrivals and thus experience significant performance degradation. Motivated by this problem, we propose new burstiness-aware algorithms to balance bursty workloads across all computing sites, and thus to improve overall system performance. We present a smart load balancer, which leverages the knowledge of burstiness to predict the changes in user demands and on-the-fly shifts between the schemes that are \u201cgreedy\u201d (i.e., always select the best site) and \u201crandom\u201d (i.e., randomly select one) based on the predicted information.

In order to develop efficient power management mechanisms for green clouds, we need a deep understanding of the influence of system configurations on the power consumption in real cloud systems. Power profiling provides such a vehicle. Existing fine-grain profiling approaches require special hardwired connections to the pins of individual hardware devices, which is not practical for large-scale production clouds. Moreover, they cannot provide a macroscopic view of the cloud-wide power dynamics. In this paper, we present macropower, a coarse-grain power and energy profiling framework. It provides a combination of hardware and software tools that achieves power/energy profiling at server granularity. It uses direct or derived measurements to isolate and combine influences from system components in cloud power profiles. It also generates the correlations between system activities and server/cloud-wide power/energy usage. We implement a prototype of macropower and test it in a cloud testbed. The profiled data are analyzed and the impact of system configurations on the server/cloud power usage is quantified, which is valuable for autonomic and energy-efficient management of cloud resources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Macropower: A coarse-grain power profiling framework for energy-efficient cloud computing","publicationTitle":"30th IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2011.6108061","displayPublicationTitle":"30th IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6097202/6108052/06108061.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2011.6108061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Macropower: A coarse-grain power profiling framework for energy-efficient cloud computing","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108061/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12441781","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macropower: A coarse-grain power profiling framework for energy-efficient cloud computing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064557S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6097202","isNumber":"6108052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6097202","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6108052","articleId":"6108061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6108063,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Mingyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"38235766100"},{"name":"Jing He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"He","id":"37597249600"},{"name":"Shouling Ji","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Shouling","lastName":"Ji","id":"37399190500"},{"name":"Yingshu Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yingshu","lastName":"Li","id":"37292401500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0012-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0010-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0011-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"CD","value":"1097-2641"}],"articleNumber":"6108063","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Optimal scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Interference","Data communication","Schedules","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","query processing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","query processing","minimum latency multiregional query scheduling problem","ML-MRQS problem","NP-hard problem","heuristic scheduling algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108063","abstract":"Query scheduling as one of the most important technologies used in query processing has been widely studied recently. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work focuses on the Minimum Latency Multi-Regional Query Scheduling (ML-MRQS) problem. In this paper, we investigate the ML-MRQS problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which aims to generate a scheduling plan with minimum latency for a more practical query model called Multi-Regional Query (MRQ). A MRQ targets at user interested data from multiple region-sofa WSN, where each region is a subarea of the WSN. We claim that the ML-MRQS problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a heuristic scheduling algorithm Multi-Regional Query Scheduling Algorithm (MRQSA) to solve this problem. Theoretical analysis shows that the latency of MRQSA is upper bounded by 23A + B + C for a MRQ with m query regions R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n..., R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n, where A = max\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i=1</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">left</sup>\n, B = max\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i=1</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n {(23D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n+5\u0394+21)k\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n}, C = \u03a3\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i=1</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n+5\u0394-m+17, m is the number of regions, \u0394 is the maximum node degree in the WSN, A is the diameter of R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n, k\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n is the maximum overlapped degree of sensor nodes in TU, Hi represents the distance of R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n with respect to the sink, and D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">left</sup>\n is the diameter of the non-overlapped part of R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n.

Conventional energy-efficient scheduling strategies developed on this kind of systems mainly focus on energy saving, lacking of the consideration of users' expectations such as expected finish time. Again, the system elasticity is not sufficiently taken into account while making scheduling decisions. In this paper, we develop a novel scheduling strategy named energy-efficient elastic (3E) scheduling for aperiodic, and independent tasks on DVS-enabled heterogeneous computing systems. The 3E strategy concentrates on adjusting tasks' supply voltages according to the system workload, thereby making the best trade-offs between energy conservation and users' expected finish times. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3E significantly improves the scheduling quality of the others, and is able to effectively enhance the system elasticity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Scheduling","Computational modeling","Voltage control","Scheduling algorithm","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","power aware computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient elastic scheduling","energy consumption","scheduling strategy","DVS-enabled heterogeneous computing system","3E strategy","system workload","energy conservation","system elasticity","dynamic voltage scaling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108069","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2011.6108069","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"30th IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"30th IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6097202/6108052/06108069.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2011.6108069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108069/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient elastic scheduling in heterogeneous computing systems","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12441789","htmlLink":"/document/6108069/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient elastic scheduling in heterogeneous computing systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076223S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6097202","isNumber":"6108052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6097202","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6108052","articleId":"6108069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6108165,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai Istin","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatics and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Istin","id":"37397637200"},{"name":"Florin Pop","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatics and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Florin","lastName":"Pop","id":"37322102300"},{"name":"Valentin Cristea","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatics and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Cristea","id":"37322099900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1536-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4540-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"6108165","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108165","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Scheduling","Program processors","Convergence","Biological cells","Cloning","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","distributed algorithms","genetic algorithms","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HIGA","hybrid immune genetic algorithm","dependent task scheduling","large scale distributed systems","memetic algorithm","innovative solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scheduling","Distributed Systems","Evolutionary Algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2011.51","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108122/6108164/06108165.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","startPage":"282","endPage":"287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2011.51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HIGA: Hybrid Immune - Genetic Algorithm for Dependent Task Scheduling in Large Scale Distributed Systems","abstract":"Optimization of the task scheduling represent one of the most important open issues of large scale distributed systems.

The technique uses linear programs to establish separations between combinatorial and coding-theoretic parameters and applies hyper graph lexicographic products to amplify these separations. This entails combining the dual solutions of the lexicographic multiplicands and proving that this is a valid dual solution of the product. Our result is general enough to apply to a large family of linear programs. This blend of linear programs and lexicographic products gives a recipe for constructing hard instances in which the gap between combinatorial or coding-theoretic parameters is polynomially large. We find polynomial gaps in cases in which the largest previously known gaps were only small constant factors or entirely unknown. Most notably, we show a polynomial separation between linear and non-linear network coding rates. This involves exploiting a connection between matroids and index coding to establish a previously unknown separation between linear and non-linear index coding rates. We also construct index coding problems with a polynomial gap between the broadcast rate and the trivial lower bound for which no gap was previously known.","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2011.39","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 52nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 52nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108120/6108130/06108222.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2011.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lexicographic Products and the Power of Non-linear Network Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Lexicographic Products and the Power of Non-linear Network Coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442887","htmlLink":"/document/6108222/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lexicographic Products and the Power of Non-linear Network Coding","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571a609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112343S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6108120","isNumber":"6108130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6108120","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6108130","articleId":"6108222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108247,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Gelles","affiliation":["CS Department, UCLA, USA"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Gelles","id":"38235103300"},{"name":"Ankur Moitra","affiliation":["School of Math, IAS"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Moitra","id":"37410644800"},{"name":"Amit Sahai","affiliation":["CS Department, UCLA, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4571-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1843-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6108247","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"abstract":"We revisit the problem of reliable interactive communication over a noisy channel, and obtain the first fully explicit (randomized) efficient constant-rate emulation procedure for reliable interactive communication. Our protocol works for any discrete memory less noisy channel with constant capacity, and fails with exponentially small probability in the total length of the protocol. Following a work by Schulman [Schulman 1993] our simulation uses a tree-code, yet as opposed to the non-constructive absolute tree-code used by Schulman, we introduce a relaxation in the notion of goodness for a tree code and define a potent tree code. This relaxation allows us to construct an explicit emulation procedure for any two-party protocol. Our results also extend to the case of interactive multiparty communication. We show that a randomly generated tree code (with suitable constant alphabet size) is an efficiently decodable potent tree code with overwhelming probability. Furthermore we are able to partially derandomize this result by means of epsilon-biased distributions using only O(N) random bits, where N is the depth of the tree.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 52nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108120/6108130/06108247.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"777","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 52nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2011.51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2011.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108130","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Explicit Coding for Interactive Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Emulation","Hamming distance","Noise measurement","Channel capacity","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tree codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient coding","explicit coding","interactive communication","noisy channel","tree-code","explicit emulation procedure","two-party protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tree codes","interactive communication with noise","derandomization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Explicit Coding for Interactive Communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108247/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442903","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Explicit Coding for Interactive Communication","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571a768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074246S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6108120","isNumber":"6108130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6108120","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6108130","articleId":"6108247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6108249,"authors":[{"name":"Tali Kaufman","affiliation":["Bar-Ilan University, Israel"],"firstName":"Tali","lastName":"Kaufman","id":"37281619100"},{"name":"Shachar Lovett","affiliation":["Institute for Advanced Study, USA"],"firstName":"Shachar","lastName":"Lovett","id":"38528574100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4571-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1843-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6108249","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Additives","Linear code","Estimation","Computer science","Complexity theory","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomials","Reed-Muller codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Weil bound extension","character sums","coding application","algebraic geometry","computer science","additive character","constant function","sparse polynomial","arbitrary degree","Reed-Muller codes","sparse polynomials","super polynomial size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Weil bound","character sums","affine invariant codes","property testing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108249","abstract":"The Weil bound for character sums is a deep result in Algebraic Geometry with many applications both in mathematics and in the theoretical computer science. The Weil bound states that for any polynomial f(x) over a finite field F and any additive character \u03c7 : F \u2192 \u2102, either \u03c7(f(x)) is a constant function or it is distributed close to uniform. The Weil bound is quite effective as long as deg (f) \u226a \u221a|F|, but it breaks down when the degree of f exceeds \u221a|F|. As the Weil bound plays a central role in many areas, finding extensions for polynomials of larger degree is an important problem with many possible applications.

In particular, this shows that the subcode of Reed-Muller codes of degree \u03c9(1) generated by traces of sparse polynomials is a code with near optimal distance, while Reed-Muller of such a degree has no distance (i.e. o(1) distance) ; this is one of the few examples where one can prove that sparse polynomials behave differently from non-sparse polynomials of the same degree. As an application we prove new general results for affine invariant codes. We prove that any affine-invariant subspace of quasi-polynomial size is (1) indeed a code (i.e. has good distance) and (2) is locally testable.

These DLS methods are based on probabilistic analyses, and therefore account for unpredictable variations of algorithmic, systemic and application level characteristics. A considerable number of DLS algorithms has been proposed in the last decade, and some of them have been effectively integrated into scientific and engineering applications, yielding significant performance improvements. However, scheduling scientific applications in large-scale distributed systems where, the chances of failure, such as processor or link failure, are high, makes the problem of achieving a load balanced execution even more challenging. Although real experiments are necessary to verify the benefits of using DLS, they prove to be very time consuming when every level of detail is required for the assessment of the execution of complex, data parallel and irregular scientific applications using DLS on a wide range of architectural platforms and computational environments. Thus, we propose the use of simulators which can give results that are not always experimentally measurable with the current technology. Simulations also help in studying the problem at various levels of abstraction and provide practical feedback. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of DLS techniques in Alea, a Grid Sim based scheduling simulator. Based on the simulation results, we further compare the load balancing characteristics of these methods in a simulated parallel and distributed computing environment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108164","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108122/6108164/06108259.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2011.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2011.22","startPage":"86","endPage":"93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the Functionality of a GridSim-Based Scheduler for Effective Use with Large-Scale Scientific Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108259/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Functionality of a GridSim-Based Scheduler for Effective Use with Large-Scale Scientific Applications","htmlLink":"/document/6108259/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12442919","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Functionality of a GridSim-Based Scheduler for Effective Use with Large-Scale Scientific Applications","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"4540a086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11842S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6108122","isNumber":"6108164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6108122","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6108164","articleId":"6108259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6108284,"authors":[{"name":"Ioan Lucian Muntean","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioan Lucian","lastName":"Muntean","id":"38242774400"},{"name":"Marius Joldos","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Joldos","id":"37892130000"},{"name":"Ilinca Raluca Ban","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ilinca Raluca","lastName":"Ban","id":"38241268700"},{"name":"Iulia Maria Morariu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Iulia Maria","lastName":"Morariu","id":"38235102900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1536-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4540-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"6108284","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Neurons","Neural microtechnology","Biological information theory","Chaos","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","neural nets","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural microcircuit","many core system","multicore system","computational neuroscience simulation","spiking neural microcircuit","parallelisation technique","biologically-based neural model","small world neural network","OpenMP parallelisation","Hodgkin-Huxley based-model"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Investigations of the Dynamics of Neural Microcircuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108284","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2011.47","startPage":"266","endPage":"269","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108122/6108164/06108284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2011.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108164","abstract":"Our ongoing work is focused on the investigation of the suitability of many core and multicore systems to computational neuroscience simulations.

As it known, living organisms offers the ability to grow with fault-tolerance and self-repair. These remarkable capabilities can be associated with principles to engine complex novel VLSI systems (embryonic machines) which would be more advantageous in many control applications where robustness and high reliability requirements are imposed. The theoretical approaches and developed artificial models were acquired in hardware redundant embryonic structure, built on a FPGA-based artificial cell network topology. In order to improve the developed embryonic system real-time control capabilities, also parallel computing techniques were implemented.

Critical to the design of such a system is the achievement of channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) to schedule the optimal users and pre-cancel the interuser interference. In order to reduce feedback amount and decrease scheduling complexity simultaneously, we propose to adopt multi-beam opportunistic beamforming (MOBF) and opportunistic space division multiple access (OSDMA) for the cases of noise and interference limited, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, it is found that, in order to satisfy QoS requirement, the admissible number of users has an upper bound, which is a function of data arrival rate and QoS requirement. With the purpose of balancing the achievable rate and feedback amount, we introduce a new concept, namely netput, as the difference of the above focused factors. By maximizing the netput, we derive the optimal feedback thresholds for the two transmission modes, respectively. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of the considered system, we obtain the optimal switch thresholds for the two modes in terms of the number of users and the SNR, respectively. Finally, our theoretical claims are validated by the numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.110748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06108296.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120511.110748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Mode Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink Employing Rateless Codes with QoS Provisioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108296/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Mode Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink Employing Rateless Codes with QoS Provisioning","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537061","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108296/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Mode Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink Employing Rateless Codes with QoS Provisioning","sourcePdf":"790-tw1202-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111327S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6108296","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6108297,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Kirchberg, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6108297/6108297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gan Zheng (S'05-M'09) received the BEng and MEng degrees from Tianjin University, China, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, both in Electronic and Information Engineering, and the PhD degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from The University of Hong Kong.

This paper sets the analytical framework and then studies physical layer security techniques for fixed legitimate receivers dispersed throughout multiple beams, each possibly surrounded by multiple (passive) eavesdroppers. The design objective is to minimize via transmit beamforming the costly total transmit power on board the satellite, while satisfying individual intended users' secrecy rate constraints. Assuming state-of-the-art satellite channel models, when perfect channel state information (CSI) about the eavesdroppers is available at the satellite, a partial zero-forcing approach is proposed for obtaining a low-complexity sub-optimal solution. For the optimal solution, an iterative algorithm combining semi-definite programming relaxation and the gradient-based method is devised by studying the convexity of the problem. Furthermore, the use of artificial noise as an additional degree-of-freedom for protection against eavesdroppers is explored. When only partial CSI about the eavesdroppers is available, we study the problem of minimizing the eavesdroppers' received signal to interference-plus-noise ratios. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120911.111460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06108297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120911.111460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","startPage":"852","endPage":"863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Security in Multibeam Satellite Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Security in Multibeam Satellite Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537062","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6108297/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer Security in Multibeam Satellite Systems","sourcePdf":"852-tw1202-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100878S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6108297","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6108298,"authors":[{"name":"Baile Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Baile","lastName":"Xie","id":"38231206800"},{"name":"Wenxun Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Wenxun","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37712351900"},{"name":"Hlaing Minn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hlaing","lastName":"Minn","id":"37269620000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6108298","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":918},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Channel estimation","Energy loss","Oscillators","Bit error rate","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","distortion","filters","OFDM modulation","spectral analysis","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exact signal model","carrier frequency offset compensation scheme","OFDM","transmitter filter","receiver filter","energy distortion","performance degradation","CFO-induced spectral misalignment","CFO compensation approach","preamble structure","received signal distortion","received signal energy loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset","CFO compensation","OFDM","preamble design","signal model","spectrum misalignment"]}],"abstract":"Carrier frequency offset (CFO) causes spectrum misalignment of transmitter and receiver filters.

That is, symbols transmitted by different transmitters could arrive at the receiver with symbol misalignment as well as relative carrier-phase offset. A second important issue is how to integrate channel coding with PNC to achieve reliable communication. This paper investigates these two issues and makes the following contributions: 1) We propose and investigate a general framework for decoding at the receiver based on belief propagation (BP). The framework can effectively deal with symbol and phase asynchronies while incorporating channel coding at the same time. 2) For unchannel-coded PNC, we show that for BPSK and QPSK modulations, our BP method can significantly reduce the asynchrony penalties compared with prior methods. 3) For QPSK unchannel-coded PNC, with a half symbol offset between the transmitters, our BP method can drastically reduce the performance penalty due to phase asynchrony, from more than 6 dB to no more than 1 dB. 4) For channel-coded PNC, with our BP method, both symbol and phase asynchronies actually improve the system performance compared with the perfectly synchronous case. Furthermore, the performance spread due to different combinations of symbol and phase offsets between the transmitters in channel-coded PNC is only around 1 dB. The implication of 3) is that if we could control the symbol arrival times at the receiver, it would be advantageous to deliberately introduce a half symbol offset in unchannel-coded PNC. The implication of 4) is that when channel coding is used, symbol and phase asynchronies are not major performance concerns in PNC.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120911.111067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120911.111067","startPage":"819","endPage":"831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06108306.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Physical-Layer Network Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Physical-Layer Network Coding","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537069","publicationDate":"February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6108306/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Physical-Layer Network Coding","sourcePdf":"819-tw1202-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10317S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6108306","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6108308,"authors":[{"name":"Khairi Ashour Hamdi","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Khairi Ashour","lastName":"Hamdi","id":"37297892800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6108308","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":830},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Bit error rate","OFDM","Nakagami distribution","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","Nakagami channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform phase distributions","OFDM signals","multipath Nakagami-m fading channels","mathematical analysis","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed signals","error rate performance","moment generating function","frequency-domain channel gains","diversity formats"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error analysis","fading channel","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new mathematical analysis for the performance of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signals over multipath Nakagami-m fading channels.

The harvested energy is modeled to arrive at the transmitter during the course of transmissions. The transmitter has a fixed number of packets to be delivered to each receiver. The objective is to minimize the time by which all of the packets are delivered to their respective destinations. To this end, we optimize the transmit powers and transmission rates in a deterministic setting. We first analyze the structural properties of the optimal transmission policy in a two-user broadcast channel via the dual problem of maximizing the departure region by a fixed time T. We prove that the optimal total transmit power sequence has the same structure as the optimal single-user transmit power sequence in . In addition, the total power is split optimally based on a cut-off power level; if the total transmit power is lower than this cut-off level, all transmit power is allocated to the stronger user; otherwise, all transmit power above this level is allocated to the weaker user. We then extend our analysis to an M-user broadcast channel. We show that the optimal total power sequence has the same structure as the two-user case and optimally splitting the total power among M users involves M-1 cut-off power levels. Using this structure, we propose an algorithm that finds the globally optimal policy. Our algorithm is based on reducing the broadcast channel problem to a single-user problem as much as possible. Finally, we illustrate the optimal policy and compare its performance with several suboptimal policies under different settings.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06108309.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.120911.101813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.120911.101813","startPage":"571","endPage":"583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcasting with an Energy Harvesting Rechargeable Transmitter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108309/","displayDocTitle":"Broadcasting with an Energy Harvesting Rechargeable Transmitter","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108309/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"12537072","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcasting with an Energy Harvesting Rechargeable Transmitter","sourcePdf":"571-tw1202-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063634S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"244","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6108309","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6108312,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran M.

Differing from conventional DAs with shunt-connected loads, the newly developed DA with a series-connected load has high input impedance, resulting in low-loss impedance matching and high-efficiency power combining. A distortion cancellation mechanism and its condition are derived, where odd-order nonlinear factors of transistors are considered, so as to retain inherent distortion cancellation between a peaking amplifier and a carrier amplifier. The validity of the design method is demonstrated using the developed 1.8-GHz GaN HEMT DA with a series-connected load. The third-order intermodulation distortion of the DA is improved by more than 15 dB at output powers from 5 to 20 dBm, compared to the case giving priority to power efficiency. The developed amplifier delivers a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 31% at an output power of 24 dBm, corresponding to 10-dB input backoff from a saturated output power of 31 dBm with a PAE of 58%. The proposed distortion reduction method can also be applied to shunt-connected-load-type amplifiers of other devices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2176505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6142663/06108316.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"360","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2176505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Efficiency Low-Distortion GaN HEMT Doherty Power Amplifier With a Series-Connected Load","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A High-Efficiency Low-Distortion GaN HEMT Doherty Power Amplifier With a Series-Connected Load","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6108316/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12508840","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Efficiency Low-Distortion GaN HEMT Doherty Power Amplifier With a Series-Connected Load","sourcePdf":"tmtt-takayama-2176505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043525S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6142663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6142663","articleId":"6108316","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6108317,"authors":[{"name":"Cai Hong Kai","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China","Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6268389/6108317/6108317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cai Hong Kai received the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2010.","She is now an Associate Professor with the School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China.

It has found great success in many application areas due to its simplicity, high accuracy, and distributed nature. This paper is a first attempt to apply BP algorithms in CSMA wireless networks. Compared to prior CSMA optimization algorithms such as ACSMA, which are measurement-based, BP-based algorithms are proactive and computational, without the need for network probing and traffic measurement. Consequently, BP-based algorithms are not affected by the temporal throughput fluctuations and can converge faster. Specifically, this paper explores three applications of BP. 1) We show how BP can be used to compute the throughputs of different links in the network given their access intensities, defined as the mean packet transmission time divided by the mean backoff countdown time. 2) We propose an inverse-BP algorithm to solve the reverse problem of how to set the access intensities of different links to meet their target throughputs. 3) We introduce a BP-adaptive CSMA algorithm to find the link access intensities that can achieve optimal system utility. The first two applications are NP-hard problems, and BP provides good approximations to them. The advantage of BP is that it can converge faster compared to prior algorithms like ACSMA, especially in CSMA networks with temporal throughput fluctuations. Furthermore, this paper goes beyond BP and considers a generalized version of it, GBP, to improve accuracy in networks with a loopy contention graph. The distributed implementation of GBP is nontrivial to construct. A contribution of this paper is to show that a \u201cmaximal clique\u201d method of forming regions in GBP: 1) yields accurate results; and 2) is amenable to distributed implementation in CSMA networks, with messages passed between one-hop neighbors only. We show that both BP and GBP algorithms for all three applications can yield solutions within seconds in real operation.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2177994","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6268389/06108317.pdf","startPage":"1276","endPage":"1289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2177994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Belief Propagation in CSMA Wireless Networks","volume":"20","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108317/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108317/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Belief Propagation in CSMA Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-kai-2177994-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083002S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6268389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6268389","articleId":"6108317","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6108325,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher J.

In particular, we identify the effects of connection-based channel usage on the QoS performance of spectrum management techniques. During the transmission period of a secondary user's connection, the phenomenon of multiple spectrum handoffs due to interruptions of primary users arises quite often. In addition to multiple interruptions, the connection-based channel usage behaviors are also affected by spectrum sensing time, switching between different channels, generally distributed service time, and channel contention between multiple secondary users. An analytical framework based on the preemptive resumption priority M/G/1 queueing theory is introduced to characterize the effects of the above factors simultaneously. The proposed generalized analytical framework can incorporate various system parameters into the design of very broad spectrum management techniques, including spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility. The applications of this analytical framework on spectrum decision as well as spectrum mobility are discussed, and some open issues using this framework are suggested in this article.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6108318/06108330.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.6108330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.6108330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A queueing-theoretical framework for QoS-enhanced spectrum management in cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Quality of service","Queueing analysis","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["queueing-theoretical framework","QoS-enhanced spectrum management","cognitive radio networks","opportunistic spectrum access","transmission period","multiple interruptions","connection-based channel","M/G/1 queueing theory","spectrum mobility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A queueing-theoretical framework for QoS-enhanced spectrum management in cognitive radio networks","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6108330/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425803","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A queueing-theoretical framework for QoS-enhanced spectrum management in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"008WANGLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09673S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6108318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6108318","articleId":"6108330","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108331,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey Ye Li","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Geoffrey Ye Li[F'06] (liye@ece.gatech.edu) received his Ph.D. degree in 1994.

Femtocells, installed at customer premises, have emerged as a promising energy-efficient solution as connectivity is provided where and when needed. This article thus first overviews femtocell deployments in the context of 3G LTE and its advanced (LTE-A) networks. It is shown that to increase spectral efficiency, operators envisage utilizing the same spectrum for femtocells as well as overlaying macrocells. This in turn leads to significant interference between macro and femto as well as adjacent femtocells, the mitigation of which yields some major power gains. We therefore present various recent interference management schemes and quantify their throughput in the context of an LTE-A cellular network overlaying femtocells. Complete downlink system-level simulations corroborate exposed analysis and thus confirm the performance effectiveness of femtocell deployments.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.6108332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6108318/06108332.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.6108332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient wireless in-home: the need for interference-controlled femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108332/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient wireless in-home: the need for interference-controlled femtocells","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425805","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108332/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient wireless in-home: the need for interference-controlled femtocells","sourcePdf":"010ZHENGLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065436S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6108318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6108318","articleId":"6108332","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6108333,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Cui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yong Cui (cuiyong@tsinghua.edu.cn) received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University.

They currently connect more than five billion people worldwide. With the advent of turbo decoders in the 1990s, the design of optimal decoders very close to the Shannon bound became possible in AWGN channels. Nowadays many researchers believe that this is true for entire wireless systems and that therefore there is not much left to investigate. In this contribution, we take a closer look at WiMAX and HSDPA, two successful cellular systems being operated currently in many countries, and check their truly achievable performance. We have measured the physical layer throughput of WiMAX and HSDPA in various realistic environments (urban and mountainous) with high-quality equipment and different antenna configurations. We furthermore compared the throughput measured to the Shannon bound. Based on our measurements, we analyze the losses in design and implementation (e.g., pilots, guard carriers, coding, equalization, and channel estimation) and report our findings. Surprisingly, we are currently only utilizing 40 percent of the available channel capacity; or roughly equivalently, we are up to 10 dB off the Shannon bound at typical operational points, thus providing a lot of potential improvement for future 4G systems. In advanced four transmit antenna configurations of HSDPA, the losses are even more pronounced, showing that our current standards are not well suited to take advantage of the much higher capacity provided.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular networks","Wireless networks","Antenna measurements","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum management","Loss

Prefiltering for Binaural Source Localization in Reverberant Environments","abstract":"Binaural sound source localization can be performed by imitation of the fundamental mechanisms of the human auditory system, which is based on the integrated effects of ear, pinnae, head and torso. In particular, two physical cues can be exploited, i.e. the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and the Interaural Level Difference (ILD). It is known that joint use of ITD and ILD provides good source azimuth estimations. In many practical situations binaural localization has to be performed in closed environments, where the presence of reverberation degrades the performance of available position estimators. In this paper a possible solution to this difficult problem is introduced. The proposed solution is based on proper use of cepstral prefiltering prior to source localization by ITD and ILD. It is shown that cepstrum can help in reducing the effects of reverberation, thus yielding better location estimates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12436435","volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6108339/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cepstrum Prefiltering for Binaural Source Localization in Reverberant Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cepstrum Prefiltering for Binaural Source Localization in Reverberant Environments","sourcePdf":"lsp-parisi-2180376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08118S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6107926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6107926","articleId":"6108339","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6108340,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Tariq Chattha","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering and Electronics, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Faisalabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6159229/6108340/6108340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassan Tariq Chattha was born in Faisalabad, Pakistan, in March 1983.

The proposed mutual coupling reduction method is based on a T-shape slot impedance transformer and can be applied to both single-band and dual-band PIFAs. For the proposed single-band dual PIFAs, the 10 dB impedance bandwidth covers the 2.4 GHz WLAN band (2.4-2.48 GHz), and within the WLAN band an isolation of over 20 dB is achieved. Moreover, the dual-band version covers both the WLAN band and the WiMAX band of 3.4-3.6 GHz, with isolations of over 19.2 dB and 22.8 dB, respectively. The efficiency, gain and radiation patterns of the two-PIFA prototypes are verified in measurements. Due to very low pattern correlation and very good matching and isolation characteristics, the capacity performances are mainly limited by radiation efficiency. The single-band and dual-band PIFAs are also studied with respect to their locations on the ground plane. An eight-fold increase in the bandwidth of one PIFA is achieved, when the single-band PIFAs are positioned at one corner of the ground plane, with the bandwidth of the other PIFA and the good isolation unchanged.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2180329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6159229/06108342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2180329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159229","startPage":"1521","endPage":"1531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Coupling Reduction of Two PIFAs With a T-Shape Slot Impedance Transformer for MIMO Mobile Terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Coupling Reduction of Two PIFAs With a T-Shape Slot Impedance Transformer for MIMO Mobile Terminals","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571327","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6108342/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Coupling Reduction of Two PIFAs With a T-Shape Slot Impedance Transformer for MIMO Mobile Terminals","sourcePdf":"tap-he-2180329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110481S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6159229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6159229","articleId":"6108342","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6108356,"authors":[{"name":"Yuying Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/6210435/6108356/6108356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuying Zhang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nantong University, Nantong, China, in 2006.

A nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller that is based on consensus theory is designed for distributed cooperative attitude synchronization. It solves synchronization issues between multiple satellites by information topology. In the proposed control scheme, a fuzzy logic system (FLS) is introduced to approximate unknown individual satellite attitude dynamics due to actuator faults. In order to achieve fault management without the involvement of ground-station operators, the proposed control laws do not require an explicit fault detection and isolation mechanism. Numerical simulation results including actuator dynamics and initial condition uncertainties show that the proposed strategy with FLS can compensate for a fault. The system continues to operate after wheel faults, and the closed-loop distributed tracking control system is stochastically stable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6108359/","accessionNumber":"12761941","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Fault-Tolerant Control for Satellite Attitude Synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Fault-Tolerant Control for Satellite Attitude Synchronization","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-li-2180391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076545S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6205698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6205698","articleId":"6108359","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":6108362,"authors":[{"name":"Wim Foubert","affiliation":["Department of Fundamental Electricity and Instrumentation, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6165484/6108362/6108362-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wim Foubert was born in Geraardsbergen, Belgium, on February 14, 1983.

AwAS is capable of controlling the position and stiffness of a joint, independently. The proposed actuator can regulate the joint stiffness through a wide range with minimum energy consumption by means of a small motor. This is possible due to its novel mechanical configuration that achieves the stiffness regulation not through the control of spring pretension (as in most of the existing variable stiffness joints) but by using the variable lever arm principle. The regulation of the lever arm length is achieved through the displacement of the spring elements. An important consequence of this mechanism is that the displacement needed to change the stiffness is perpendicular to the forces generated by the spring. This helps to reduce the energy/power required to regulate the stiffness. It is experimentally shown that AwAS is capable of minimizing energy consumption through exploiting the natural dynamics in real time for both fixed and variable frequency motions.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2177098","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6301724/06108364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2177098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6301724","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","startPage":"355","endPage":"365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Intrinsically Energy Efficient Actuator With Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS)","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6108364/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12982074","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Intrinsically Energy Efficient Actuator With Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS)","sourcePdf":"tmech-tsagarakis-2177098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108426S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6301724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6301724","articleId":"6108364","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108365,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Gui Han","affiliation":["Beijing University of Technology, College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Gui","lastName":"Han","id":"37534590300"},{"name":"Jun-Fei Qiao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Technology, College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun-Fei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37273179900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6108365","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1717},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Computational modeling","Heuristic algorithms","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","learning (artificial intelligence)","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear dynamical systems","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive computation algorithm","RBF neural network","learning algorithm","nonlinear modelling","radial basis function neural networks","neural network training","Lyapunov criterion","nonlinear dynamic system","computational complexity analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive computation algorithm","modelling","nonlinear systems","radial basis function neural networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Models, Statistical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Computation Algorithm for RBF Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145493","endPage":"347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6145493/06108365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178559","startPage":"342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108365","abstract":"A novel learning algorithm is proposed for nonlinear modelling and identification using radial basis function neural networks. The proposed method simplifies neural network training through the use of an adaptive computation algorithm (ACA). In addition, the convergence of the ACA is analyzed by the Lyapunov criterion. The proposed algorithm offers two important advantages. First, the model performance can be significantly improved through ACA, and the modelling error is uniformly ultimately bounded. Secondly, the proposed ACA can reduce computational cost and accelerate the training speed. The proposed method is then employed to model classical nonlinear system with limit cycle and to identify nonlinear dynamic system, exhibiting the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Computational complexity analysis and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12509365","htmlLink":"/document/6108365/","pubMedId":"24808512","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Computation Algorithm for RBF Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Computation Algorithm for RBF Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tnnls-han-2178559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06141S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6145493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6145493","articleId":"6108365","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6108370,"authors":[{"name":"Chien Hsun Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6204215/6108370/6108370-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Hsun Tseng received the B.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from the National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, the M.Math. degree from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia, in 1995, 1997, and 2000, respectively.","From 2000 to 2001, he was a Research Scientist at Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS), Berlin, Germany.

In essence, the continuous physical system served by a nonlinear Kirchhoff circuit is transformed to an equivalent discrete dynamic system implemented by a multidimensional wave digital filtering (MDWDF) network. This amounts to numerically approximating the differential equations used to describe elements of a MD passive electrical circuit by grid-based difference equations. Details to achieve the desired digital network with initial and boundary conditions incorporated are described. In particular, the MD passivity established in the reference circuit has led to uniquely a high degree of robustness of the MDWDF architecture with the focus on the handling of computational errors. Visual demonstration is depicted for some nature effects of wave propagation from and across artificial boundaries in unbounded and bounded domains. An insight about numerical stability and error propagations directly linked to the passivity of the reference circuit is presented by extensively analyzing the proposed solution for the convergent behaviors of the MDWDF network. In addition, feasible comparisons between the MDWDF method and the finite element method (FEM) implemented in the COMSOL Multiphysics are also presented by focusing on the stability performance in a bounded domain.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2173511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6204215","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6204215/06108370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Visualization of a Time-Dependent Shallow Water System Using Nonlinear Kirchhoff Circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6108370/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Visualization of a Time-Dependent Shallow Water System Using Nonlinear Kirchhoff Circuit","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761300","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Visualization of a Time-Dependent Shallow Water System Using Nonlinear Kirchhoff Circuit","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tseng-2173511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095086S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6204215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6204215","articleId":"6108370","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6108371,"authors":[{"name":"Alex S.

These attributes make them suitable as the energy storage system in electric, hybrid electric vehicle, and plug-in vehicles (EV/HEV/PHEV). One of the important requirements in automotive batteries is to monitor their real time state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH). Open circuit voltage, as one parameter used for predicting the SOC in the battery, is not readily available during charge and discharge cycles. In this paper a new method for prediction of the terminal voltage in li-ion batteries based on the impulse response concept has been proposed. By obtaining the impulse response of the li-ion battery, one can use the terminal current to predict the output voltage of the battery. Online comparison of the predicted and measured terminal voltage provides a tool for online monitoring of the SOH and SOC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12543457","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6108373/","publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online Estimation of State of Charge in Li-Ion Batteries Using Impulse Response Concept","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Estimation of State of Charge in Li-Ion Batteries Using Impulse Response Concept","sourcePdf":"tsg-fahimi-2169818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060024S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6108373","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":6108374,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Rao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6155182/6108374/6108374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Rao received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2010.","She is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.

As the demand on Internet services drastically increases in recent years, the electricity consumed by Internet data centers (IDCs) has been skyrocketing. While most existing research focuses on reducing electric energy consumption of IDCs at one specific location, the problem of reducing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the present multi-electricity-market environment, where the price of electricity may exhibit temporal and spatial diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing the quality of service (i.e., service level objectives) such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of critical importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost under multiple electricity markets environment while guaranteeing the quality of service geared to the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price. The problem is modeled as a constrained mixed-integer programming and an efficient solution algorithm is proposed. Extensive evaluations based on real-world electricity price data for multiple IDC locations illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/06108374.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2170100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2170100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Energy Cost Management of Distributed Internet Data Centers in Smart Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electricity","Servers","Delay","Smart grids","Internet","Portals","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","integer programming","Internet","power consumption","power engineering computing","power system economics","power system management","quality of service","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated energy cost management","distributed Internet data centers","smart grid","electricity cost management","Internet service providers","spatially distributed data centers","electric energy consumption reduction","multiple electricity market environment","quality of service","total electricity cost reduction","location diversity","time diversity","constrained mixed integer programming","multiple IDC locations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electricity markets","energy efficiency","energy management","Internet data centers","mixed-integer linear programming","smart grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Energy Cost Management of Distributed Internet Data Centers in Smart Grid","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6108374/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543458","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Energy Cost Management of Distributed Internet Data Centers in Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-rao-2170100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102416S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"6108374","onlineDate":"19 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6108376,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6151237/6108376/6108376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Liu (S'10) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","From January 2010 to April 2010, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.

Hence, a rich Semantic Web service description is needed to achieve an automated Web service discovery, composition and invocation. On the other hand, the acceptance of Semantic Web service is still decelerating because of its language complexity and lack of knowledge in the field of knowledge engineering and knowledge representation among developers. Due to the proper assessment of model-driven approaches that are used to develop Semantic Web services, it is significant to have an appropriate categorization of these approaches. Thus, the key goal of this paper is to classify several model-driven approaches for developing Semantic Web services.

Genetic algorithms are considered as an efficient approach for solving this type of problems.

The local search is applied to use its exploitive search ability to improve the search efficiency of the proposed GA.

In this context, an automated machine vision system that has the ability to differentiate between broadleaf and grass weeds in digital images to optimize the selection and dosage of herbicides can enhance the profitability and lessen environmental degradation. This paper presents an efficient and effective texture-based weed classification method using local binary pattern (LBP). The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using micro-level texture patterns to classify weed images into broadleaf and grass categories for real-time selective herbicide applications. Two well-known machine learning methods, template matching and support vector machine, are used for classification. Experiments on 200 sample field images with 100 samples from each category show that, the proposed method is capable of classifying weed images with high accuracy and computational efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108524/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12442632","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108524/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study on local binary pattern for automated weed classification using template matching and support vector machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on local binary pattern for automated weed classification using template matching and support vector machine","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"57cinti2011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124863S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6098797","isNumber":"6108466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6098797","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6108466","articleId":"6108524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6108528,"authors":[{"name":"Sasa A.

The system is using a combination of two navigation algorithms: self-learning neural network, necessary to form a movement plan for a robot, and a collision-free control algorithm based on heuristic neuro-fuzzy approach. The basic task of neural network is to generate initial path. Heuristic base of rules for collision free algorithm are limited and does not cover all situations. Main contribution of proposed navigation is related to neural network property to supplements special cases that are not covered by present heuristic rules from the data base. Both algorithms are adapted and implemented to navigate real platform of a mobile robot equipped by two independent wheel drives, encoders and a set of short-range sonars. The combined reactive algorithm (using two control methods) is used in real time for obstacle navigation in robotized system. Navigation algorithms are placed into a PC, which is connected to mobile robot by wireless and wired links.

Simulation results demonstrate that proposed method not only meets design specifications and satisfies design constraints but also minimizes total MOS area with respect to convex optimization method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108562","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6098797/6108466/06108562.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"528","doi":"10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Swarm intelligence based sizing methodology for CMOS operational amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Swarm intelligence based sizing methodology for CMOS operational amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6108562/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442670","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Swarm intelligence based sizing methodology for CMOS operational amplifier","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"91cinti2011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046485S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6098797","isNumber":"6108466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6098797","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6108466","articleId":"6108562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6108563,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Asif Rana","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Asif","lastName":"Rana","id":"37086935482"},{"name":"Zubair Usman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Zubair","lastName":"Usman","id":"38234983600"},{"name":"Zeeshan Shareef","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Zeeshan","lastName":"Shareef","id":"37547441800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0045-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0044-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0043-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6108563","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":871},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Control systems","Tuning","Particle swarm optimization","Birds","Particle beams"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beams (structures)","cognitive systems","control system synthesis","evolutionary computation","feedback","fuzzy control","particle swarm optimisation","position control","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic ball and beam system control","evolutionary algorithms","bird-flock cognitive behavior","bird-flock social behavior","particle swarm optimization algorithm","optimization technique","PID controllers","feedback loops","fitness value function","PSO tuning","ITAE equations method","fuzzy logic controller","PID tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm optimization","Ball and Beam system","fitness function","ITAE equations","Fuzzy-logic controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108563","abstract":"Over the last few decades, many evolutionary algorithms have emerged. One such algorithm is Particle Swarm Optimization which emulates social and cognitive behavior of bird-flocks. In this paper, particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented as a robust and highly useful optimization technique to tune the gains of the PID controllers in the two feedback loops of the classic Ball and Beam Control System. As the name implies, Ball and Beam control system tends to balance a ball on a particular position on the beam as defined by the user. Various trials of the algorithm with varying parameters is implemented on the control system and the fitness of the response of the system to a unit step input is used as a criterion for judging the most optimal solution. A slight variation in the fitness value function is also introduced, rather than using conventional performance integrals as a criterion. Furthermore, the results from PSO tuning are quantitatively compared to ITAE equations method of PID tuning and Fuzzy-logic controller to reach a conclusion on the most efficient controlling technique.","doi":"10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108563","startPage":"529","endPage":"534","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108466","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6098797/6108466/06108563.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic control of ball and beam system using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108563/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic control of ball and beam system using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108563/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12442671","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic control of ball and beam system using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"92cinti2011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064924S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6098797","isNumber":"6108466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6098797","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6108466","articleId":"6108563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6108567,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Quantitative Blush Evaluator (QuBE) program was developed for the calculation of myocardial perfusion score. Calculation of QuBE values is often affected by patient motion and become inaccurate. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to reduce undesired motion in coronary angiogram. This algorithm correct frame motion by shifting each single frame according to the best correlation with the first frame. The effectiveness of this stablizing method achieved by searching scale-invariant feature from each frame of coronary angiogram in order to find the best correlation between two frame. The results showed that MBG categorization based on modified QuBE program exactly match with the original QuBE program. In addition, results also showed that application of stabilization algorithm using SIFT method decreased the deviation by 15% therefore it increased the accuracy of QuBE value calculation. Finally, this new algorithm also decreased the execution time by 71% so the doctor could faster patient diagnosis. In conclusion the new algorithm could enhance the qualitiy of QuBE value calculations in MBG scoring for coronary angiogram.","doi":"10.1109/ICICI-BME.2011.6108605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICI-BME.2011.6108605","startPage":"111","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Instrumentation, Communications, Information Technology, and Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Instrumentation, Communications, Information Technology, and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096518/6108578/06108605.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coronary angiogram stabilization for QuBE values calculation using SIFT method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108605/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Nov. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coronary angiogram stabilization for QuBE values calculation using SIFT method","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12460050","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6108605/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coronary angiogram stabilization for QuBE values calculation using SIFT method","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"04BME02032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057028S","chronDate":"8-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096518","isNumber":"6108578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096518","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6108578","articleId":"6108605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6108646,"authors":[{"name":"Adi Soeprijanto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Adi","lastName":"Soeprijanto","id":"37399834700"},{"name":"Muhammad Abdillah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Abdillah","id":"38072236000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1166-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1167-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1165-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6108646","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed power generation","Propagation losses","Particle swarm optimization","Equations","Power transmission lines","Optimization","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","fuzzy logic","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["type 2 fuzzy adaptive binary particle swarm optimization","optimal placement","distributed generation sizing","T2FABPSOM","active power losses","type-2 fuzzy logic system","IEEE 30 bus system","fuzzy adaptive binary PSO","FABPSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["binary pso","distributed generation","type-2 fls","t2fabpso"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108646","abstract":"This paper proposes a new method for optimizing the placement and size of distributed generation (DG) using type-2 fuzzy adaptive binary particle swarm optimization with single mutation operator, called T2FABPSOM.

Apart from converting AC input to DC output signal, the investigation also focused on the introduction of passive damping network at DC side to improve the total harmonic distortion (THD). Classical rectifier with LC filter at DC side of the rectifier will create non sinusoidal input current. As a result, it contributes to high THD supply current. Passive Damping Network at DC side was introduced to compensate this problem. The work will be started with some analysis on the relationship between the output and input voltages and the output impedance of filter system in designing the passive damping network using Matlab.

Correlation amongst signal and interferers is considered in large scale fading environment. We assume each node is power controlled while antenna diversity is present only at the sink. Energy consumption for successful delivery of information from source to sink is also evaluated. Two kinds of interference namely multiple access interference (MAI) and node interference (NI) are considered and an infinite automatic repeat request (ARQ) is assumed at link layer between a sending node and sink till successful delivery of packetized data. An appropriate model for evaluating quality of service (QoS) in terms of probability of outage and BER at sink is presented and validated by simulation. The effects of node density, correlation amongst signal and interferers, and number of antennas used for spatial diversity on outage probability and BER are investigated.

For each optimal design, optimal current excitation weights and optimal radii are determined having the objective of maximum Sidelobe Level (SLL) reduction. The extensive computational results show that the CCAA designs having central element feeding with non-isotropic elements yield much more reduction in SLL as compared to the same not having central element feeding. Moreover, the particular CCAA containing 4, 6 and 8 number of elements in three successive rings along with central element feeding yields grand minimum SLL (-46.0 dB).

Genetic algorithm (GA) and an improved Particle swarm optimization (PSO) called Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor and Inertia Weight Approach (PSOCFIWA) have been used here for the design of linear phase band pass finite impulse response (FIR) filters. The fitness function is based on the squared error between the actual and the ideal filter response. PSOCFIWA seems to be promising optimization tool for FIR filter design especially in a dynamic environment where filter coefficients have to be adapted and fast convergence is of importance. Digital filter plays an important role in today's world of communication and computation. On the other hand, to design a digital finite impulse response (FIR) filter satisfying all the required conditions is a challenging one. In this paper, we have introduced an iterative method to find the optimal solution of optimal FIR filter design. FIR filter design is a multi-modal optimization problem. The conventional gradient based optimization techniques are not efficient for digital filter design. Given the filter specification to be realized, PSOCFIWA algorithm generates a set of filter coefficients and tries to meet the ideal frequency characteristic. In this paper, for the given problem, the realization of the FIR band pass filters of different order has been performed. The magnitude responses are demonstrated for the different design techniques of digital FIR filters. The simulation results have been compared with the well accepted evolutionary algorithm such as genetic algorithm (GA). The results justify that the proposed FIR filter design approach using PSOCFIWA outperforms to that of GA, not only in the accuracy of the designed filter but also in the convergence speed and solution quality.","doi":"10.1109/ISIEA.2011.6108725","startPage":"326","endPage":"331","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6098798/6108666/06108725.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIEA.2011.6108725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of linear phase FIR band pass filter using Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor and Inertia Weight Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Band pass filters","Filtering algorithms","Genetic algorithms","IIR filters","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","evolutionary computation","FIR filters","genetic algorithms","gradient methods","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear phase FIR band pass filter optimization","constriction factor","inertia weight approach","evolutionary algorithm","digital filter","genetic algorithm","GA","particle swarm optimization","PSOCFIWA","finite impulse response filter","fitness function","iterative method","multimodal optimization problem","conventional gradient based optimization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FIR Filter","PSO","GA","Evolutionay Optimization Technique","Magnitude Response","Convergence","Band Pass Filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of linear phase FIR band pass filter using Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor and Inertia Weight Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108725/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442731","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of linear phase FIR band pass filter using Particle Swarm Optimization with Constriction Factor and Inertia Weight Approach","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p326kar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07677S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6098798","isNumber":"6108666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6098798","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6108666","articleId":"6108725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108738,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd Khairul Azli Azmi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Khairul","lastName":"Azli Azmi","id":"37085957454"},{"name":"Nurhani Kasuan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nurhani","lastName":"Kasuan","id":"37397906400"},{"name":"Mohd Hezri Fazalul Rahiman","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Hezri","lastName":"Fazalul Rahiman","id":"37085388104"},{"name":"Mohd Nasir Taib.","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Nasir","lastName":"Taib.","id":"37322448400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1417-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1418-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1416-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6108738","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108738","abstract":"This paper presents a neural network controller in model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for steam temperature regulation in steam distillation process. Steam temperature is one of the most significant parameters that can influence the composition of essential oil yield. Due to parameter variations and changes in operational conditions during distillation, a robust steam temperature controller becomes nontrivial to avoid the degradation of essential oil quality. Initially, the PRBS input is fed to the system and output of steam temperature is collected and modeled using ARX model. Model reference for adaptive control is designed using first order plus dead time (FOPDT) transfer function. The weights of neural network are updated using Recursive Prediction Error Method (RPEM). The performance of neural network is compared using different number of hidden layer, momentum rate and learning rate. The experimental result demonstrates the proposed neural network using 9 hidden nodes achieves a better control to the system.","doi":"10.1109/ISIEA.2011.6108738","startPage":"393","endPage":"398","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6098798/6108666/06108738.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIEA.2011.6108738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based model reference adaptive control (NMRAC) for steam temperature regulation in steam distillation process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Training","Adaptive control","Heating","Process control","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distillation","essential oils","model reference adaptive control systems","neurocontrollers","recursive estimation","regulation","steam","temperature control","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRAC","steam distillation process","steam temperature","operational conditions","parameter variations","distillation","robust steam temperature controller","nontrivial","essential oil quality","PRBS input","ARX model","first order plus dead time transfer function","FOPDT transfer function","neural network weights","recursive prediction error method","RPEM","hidden nodes","essential oil composition","neural network based model reference adaptive control","NMRAC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network controller","Recursive Prediction Error","Model Reference Adaptive Control","steam temperature","steam distillation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based model reference adaptive control (NMRAC) for steam temperature regulation in steam distillation process","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442744","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based model reference adaptive control (NMRAC) for steam temperature regulation in steam distillation process","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p393azmi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103915S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6098798","isNumber":"6108666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6098798","xplore-issue":"6108666","articleId":"6108738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6108743,"authors":[{"name":"Siti Amely Jumaat","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6098798/6108666/6108743/6108743-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siti Amely Jumaat graduated from the Institut Tun Hussein Onn (ITTHO-UTM) with honours degree in BSc.

Being extensively utilized, electric wheelchairs have already been one of the indispensable medical rehabilitation devices. Without doubt, the increase of standing function on electric wheelchairs would be further beneficial to patients. The controller system of the ESW is mainly based on the SoPC (System on a Programmable Chip) constructed by FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and one Nios II processor produced by Altera company. The electric wheels are built up by two DC rim motors while the standing frame is composed of a linear motion mechanism and a parallel four-bar linkage mechanism. The motion controller IC is realized by PDL with the function of standing frame and two DC rim motors' speed control. The controller of standing frame consists of one motor drive and four channels of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal outputs. Therefore, the necessary all digital drive controller of ESW is realized in one FPGA. This ESW enable not only the two-wheel machine to locate, synchronize, turn left or right, move forward or backward, brake and stop, but also the standing frame to lift and fall. Finally, this work completes one experiment system including a FPGA board, three converters, one two-wheel drive standing wheelchair platform that further evidences both the effectiveness and accuracy of the FPGA-based motion controller for ESW.","doi":"10.1109/ISIEA.2011.6108757","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6098798/6108666/06108757.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIEA.2011.6108757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realization of an FPGA-based Motion control system for electric standing wheelchairs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Realization of an FPGA-based Motion control system for electric standing wheelchairs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108757/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12442762","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of an FPGA-based Motion control system for electric standing wheelchairs","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p47kung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059229S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6098798","isNumber":"6108666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6098798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6108666","articleId":"6108757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6108763,"authors":[{"name":"Shahril Irwan Sulaiman","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Shahril Irwan","lastName":"Sulaiman","id":"37317137600"},{"name":"Titik Khawa Abdul Rahman","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Titik Khawa","lastName":"Abdul Rahman","id":"37301516000"},{"name":"Ismail Musirin","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Musirin","id":"37294282200"},{"name":"Sulaiman Shaari","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Sulaiman","lastName":"Shaari","id":"37541932100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1417-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1418-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1416-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6108763","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":624},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Inverters","Genetic algorithms","Photovoltaic systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","invertors","iterative methods","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","power system interconnection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid-connected photovoltaic system","genetic algorithm","intelligent algorithm","optimal PV module","inverter databases","technical sizing outputs","photovoltaic array configuration","inverter-to-PV array","sizing factor","evolutionary strategy","iterative sizing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["photovoltaic (PV)","grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV)","PV module","inverter","genetic algorithm (GA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108763","abstract":"This paper presents an intelligent-based algorithm for sizing grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV) system using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

The factor provides a variable range of the loop in the process of Finite Persisting Sphere. By the existing of the variable range, the risk to have too large number of loop or too small number of loop in the FPSGA can be reduced. Too large number of loop will risk of repeating using the same data and too small number of loop will cause the loss of good genes in the FPSGA. By the proposed approach, potential to achieve the global solution in a small number of population will be increased and at the same time less time required running the process in the loop.

Consequences of configuration modifications must therefore be evaluated at design time to quantify the risk of critical application failures.

Morphological operations are used to remove the non road area based on the assumptions that road regions are an elongated area that has largest connected component.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Road extraction using K-Means clustering and morphological operations","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108839","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096321/6108829/06108839.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Road extraction using K-Means clustering and morphological operations","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108839/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12459881","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Road extraction using K-Means clustering and morphological operations","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"7a1569449437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059594S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096321","isNumber":"6108829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096321","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6108829","articleId":"6108839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108842,"authors":[{"name":"Roshan Singh","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering and Technology, GLA University, Mathura, India"],"firstName":"Roshan","lastName":"Singh","id":"38236221600"},{"name":"Ravindra Kumar Purwar","affiliation":["University School of Information Technology, GGSIP University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ravindra Kumar","lastName":"Purwar","id":"38095423600"},{"name":"Navin Rajpal","affiliation":["University School of Information Technology, GGSIP University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Navin","lastName":"Rajpal","id":"37297841800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-861-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-859-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-860-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6108842","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"abstract":"One of the most crucial tasks in content based video coding is the object retrieval and its tracking in subsequent frames.

In this work, an adaptive framework is proposed and simulated for multi-user video transmission over OFDMA-based communication system for the efficient streaming of multi-layered H.264 video over wireless channels. The aim of the proposed method is to combine adaptive sub-carrier allocation and bit loading with the transmission of the H.264 SVC(Scalable Video Coding ) encoded video sequences in order to increase the number of supported users in the system and provide the best quality of service(QoS) to the sub-carriers. The scalable extension H.264/MPEG4-AVC video codec is used to obtain two different bitstreams: a base-layer (carrying the most critical information content at low bitrate), and an enhancement layer, characterized by increasing bitrate and decreasing importance of video content. A prior study of the video quality is performed with a theoretical model, as the quality of the received video will depend on the errors introduced by the wireless channel. The required BER is depends on the video quality, which is the most crucial parameter to determine. The bandwidth is distributed among the orthogonal sub-carriers and the best suited sub-carriers is given to the base layers to achieve the required BER. The paper proposes an overview of the system and tests its performance through extensive simulations. The proposed framework significantly improves the video transmission quality with the maximum use of radio resources.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108849","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096321/6108829/06108849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108829","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wireless video streaming system based on OFDMA with multi-layer H.264 coding and adaptive radio resource allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A wireless video streaming system based on OFDMA with multi-layer H.264 coding and adaptive radio resource allocation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108849/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12459891","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6108849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wireless video streaming system based on OFDMA with multi-layer H.264 coding and adaptive radio resource allocation","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"7a1569465813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062689S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096321","isNumber":"6108829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096321","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6108829","articleId":"6108849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6108866,"authors":[{"name":"Santu Sardar","affiliation":["DRDO, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Santu","lastName":"Sardar","id":"37709153300"},{"name":"Gaurav Tewari","affiliation":["DRDO, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Tewari","id":"37705391700"},{"name":"K.

Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) have proven effective approach for face recognition. Software implementations fail to capture the inherent parallelism of RBFN and incur long training time. Although, hardware implementations can speed up the training process, they may lead to inflexible solution. The main challenges of Face Recognition today are broad lightning variations, handling rotation in depth, together with personal appearance changes. A highly accurate face recognition system requires a number of complex sub-operations to be performed. To balance the flexibility of the involved sub-modules and to achieve high accuracy in face recognition, we propose an embedded computing system, consisting of a processor and dedicated fully parallelized Cognimem Neural Network chip based board. We will also identify the optimized algorithm for each of the involved sub-operations. Results obtained after testing our proposed system, with standard databases, show promising performances in terms of Recognition accuracy, False acceptance rate (FAR), False rejection rate (FRR), training time and testing time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096321/6108829/06108866.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware/software co-design model for face recognition using Cognimem Neural Network chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Neurons","Databases","Accuracy","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","embedded systems","face recognition","hardware-software codesign","image classification","principal component analysis","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software co-design model","Cognimem neural network chip","automated face recognition","radial basis function networks","embedded computing system","recognition accuracy","false acceptance rate","false rejection rate","PCA method","ANN classifier","DWT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radial basis function Networks (RBFN)","Cognimem Neural Network chip","accuracy","FAR","FRR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A hardware/software co-design model for face recognition using Cognimem Neural Network chip","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108866/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12459908","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware/software co-design model for face recognition using Cognimem Neural Network chip","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"7a1569469283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076271S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096321","isNumber":"6108829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096321","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6108829","articleId":"6108866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108892,"authors":[{"name":"Ebada Sarhan","affiliation":["Computer science Department, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ebada","lastName":"Sarhan","id":"37284031900"},{"name":"Eraky Khalifa","affiliation":["Computer science Department, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Eraky","lastName":"Khalifa","id":"38241582800"},{"name":"Ayman M.

The imbalances produced may cause insufficient attenuation in image frequency band leading to interference. The problem needs to be compensated. This paper represents novel architecture design and implementation of COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm based Adaptive FIR filter using Trigonometric Least Mean Square (TLMS) algorithm to give a solution for correcting I/Q imbalances. The design of CORDIC in the vector rotation mode results in high system throughput due to its pipelined architecture where latency is reduced in each of the pipelined stage and finds its appropriate application in real time signal processing. The good convergence of CORDIC in the given LMS algorithm based adaptive filter facilitates in easy calculation of new filter weights.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108916","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096321/6108829/06108916.pdf","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108916/","displayDocTitle":"Gain-phase mismatch correction technique for I/Q channel receiver","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6108916/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12459957","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain-phase mismatch correction technique for I/Q channel receiver","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"7a1569479815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075724S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096321","isNumber":"6108829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096321","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6108829","articleId":"6108916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108938,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The available face recognition algorithm performance in presence of multiple variations such as illumination, pose, expression, occlusion and plastic surgery is not satisfactory. Also, periocular biometrics face problems in presence of spectacles, head angle, hair and expression. A method which can extract multiple feature information from a single source and can give a satisfactory performance even with less number of training images is desirable. Thus combining face and periocular data obtained from the same image may increase the performance of the recognition system. A detailed performance analysis of face recognition and periocular biometric using Gabor and LBP features is carried out. This is then compared with the proposed multimodal biometric feature extraction technique. The experimental results obtained using Muct and plastic surgery face database shows that the proposed multimodal biometric performs better than other face recognition and individual biometric methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108945","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096321/6108829/06108945.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition using multimodal biometric features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108945/","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition using multimodal biometric features","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12459985","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108945/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition using multimodal biometric features","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"7a1569480921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08158S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096321","isNumber":"6108829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096321","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6108829","articleId":"6108945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108986,"authors":[{"name":"Di-xiao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Weaponry Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Di-xiao Wu","id":"38238359300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-881-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-879-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6108986","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":661},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Vectors","Complexity theory","Phase shift keying","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","OFDM modulation","probability","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial transmit sequence","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","broadband wireless transmission","multipath fading","OFDM signal","peak-to-average power ratio","system efficiency","PAPR reduction performance","selective mapping","SLM method","probability","SLM algorithm","PTS algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","peak-to-average power ratios","selective mapping","partial transmit sequence"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been currently under intense research for broadband wireless transmission due to its robustness against multi-path fading. However, OFDM signals are characterized by large peak-to-average power ratios (PAPR), which can reduce the system efficiency. To overcome this problem, in this paper, based on the definition of the PAPR in OFDM systems, we will mainly investigate the PAPR reduction performance with two different PAPR reduction methods: the selective mapping (SLM) and partial transmit sequence (PTS). A comprehensive analysis and comparison are conducted in terms of all possible influencing factors and PAPR reduction performance, respectively. Some research findings are obtained based on the simulation results. The results verify that PTS method provides a better PAPR reduction performance compared to SLM method and the probability of high PAPR with increasing the number of sub-blocks in PTS technique decreases obviously, compared to the original OFDM signal. In addition, SLM algorithm is more suitable if the system can tolerate more redundant information; otherwise, PTS algorithm is more acceptable when complexity becomes the first considering factor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selected mapping and partial transmit sequence schemes to reduce PAPR in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/IASP.2011.6108986","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096320/6108985/06108986.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2011.6108986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Selected mapping and partial transmit sequence schemes to reduce PAPR in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108986/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12443522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selected mapping and partial transmit sequence schemes to reduce PAPR in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059844S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096320","isNumber":"6108985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096320","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6108985","articleId":"6108986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108992,"authors":[{"name":"Di-xiao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Weaponry Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Di-xiao Wu","id":"38238359300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-881-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-879-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6108992","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is an attractive modulation technique for communication between unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) and a distant mother platform. The objective of this study is improving channel estimation accuracy in OFDM system because channel state information is required for signal detection at the receiver and its accuracy affects the overall performance of the system and it is essential to improve the channel estimation for more reliable communications. In this paper, the pilot signal estimation based on Least Square (LS), together with channel interpolation based on the discrete cosine transform, namely DCT-based LS estimator, is compared with LS channel estimation approaches and discussed. Two well known performance criteria: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER) are used for comparison by using Monte Carlo Simulations for 16 quartered amplitude modulation (16QAM). The results verify that the DCT-based LS estimator has a better performance for OFDM systems. Moreover, the effect of power limitation in terms of SNR and the number of pilots for a wireless channel is determined to compare the DCT-based LS estimator. The result indicates that the estimator with large number of pilots has better performance, but increases the computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096320/6108985/06108992.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/IASP.2011.6108992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2011.6108992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Comparison Of Pilot-Aided OFDM channel estimation algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","communication complexity","discrete cosine transforms","error statistics","least squares approximations","marine communication","mean square error methods","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","receivers","remotely operated vehicles","signal detection","underwater vehicles","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-aided OFDM channel estimation algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","modulation technique","unmanned underwater vehicle","distant mother platform","signal detection","receiver","pilot signal estimation","least square estimator","channel interpolation","discrete cosine transform","DCT","performance criteria","mean square error","bit error rate","Monte Carlo simulation","quartered amplitude modulation","QAM","wireless channel","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UUV","OFDM","channel estimation","Least Square","discrete cosine transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6108992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"On Comparison Of Pilot-Aided OFDM channel estimation algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6108992/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12443528","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Comparison Of Pilot-Aided OFDM channel estimation algorithms","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041291S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096320","isNumber":"6108985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096320","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6108985","articleId":"6108992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6108995,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenzhou An","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China","School of Information Technology and Engineering, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, China"],"firstName":"Zhenzhou","lastName":"An","id":"37586677600"},{"name":"Xinling Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Xinling","lastName":"Shi","id":"37401243900"},{"name":"Junhua Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Junhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407593900"},{"name":"Baolei Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"lastName":"Baolei Li","id":"38239962400"},{"name":"Aimin Miao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Aimin Miao","id":"37396108500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-881-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-879-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6108995","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6108995","abstract":"The concept of the family was previously introduced into Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

The results of the reconstruction show that the proposed algorithm can obtain a similar image quality with fewer samples, which is valuable for high-resolution satellite image transmission and storage system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2011.6109026","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096320/6108985/06109026.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"191","doi":"10.1109/IASP.2011.6109026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform sampling and reconstruction for high resolution satellite images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform sampling and reconstruction for high resolution satellite images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6109026/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12443562","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109026/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform sampling and reconstruction for high resolution satellite images","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05089S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096320","isNumber":"6108985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096320","xplore-issue":"6108985","articleId":"6109026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6109064,"authors":[{"name":"MingYong Jiang","affiliation":["Academy of Equipment Command and Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"MingYong Jiang","id":"37087361221"},{"name":"XiangNing Chen","affiliation":["Academy of Equipment Command and Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"XiangNing Chen","id":"37087217474"},{"name":"XiaQiong Yu","affiliation":["Academy of Equipment Command and Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"XiaQiong Yu","id":"37087361905"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-881-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-879-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6109064","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Image edge detection","Cameras","Optical imaging","Computers","Manganese","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","Hopfield neural nets","image restoration","matrix algebra","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive suboptimal Hopfield neural network","image restoration","edge detection","Hopfield neural network restoration","energy function minimization","blur matrix","adaptive regularization","Sobel detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image restoration","Hopfield Neural Network","Sub-Optimal scheme","edge detection","adaptive regularization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109064","abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive Sub-Optimization Hopfield Neural Network for regularized image restoration based on edge detection is presented. The conventional Hopfield Neural Network restoration is an optimal scheme based on the whole image by minimizing the energy function, which costs too much memory resource since the big `blur matrix'. A large image would cause the computer to run out of memory due to the big `blur matrix'; that means, this optimal scheme cannot restore large size images. To avoid this problem, a Sub-Optimal scheme is utilized that restores the pixels of the distorted image one by one, based on the information of its neighborhood. Adaptive regularization is implemented by using the edge information detected by the Sobel Detector, which can preserve the details and improve the performance of the algorithm. Simulations show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IASP.2011.6109064","startPage":"364","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2011.6109064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108985","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096320/6108985/06109064.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sub-Optimal Hopfield Neural Network image restoration base on edge detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109064/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sub-Optimal Hopfield Neural Network image restoration base on edge detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6109064/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12443600","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sub-Optimal Hopfield Neural Network image restoration base on edge detection","confLoc":"Hubei","sourcePdf":"079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05382S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6096320","isNumber":"6108985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6096320","xplore-issue":"6108985","articleId":"6109064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6109110,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Jian Wang","id":"37599839600"},{"name":"Zhiyan Han","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Zhiyan Han","id":"37597243800"},{"name":"Shuxian Lun","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Shuxian Lun","id":"37269732500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-881-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-879-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6109110","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109110","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emotion recognition","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Speech recognition","Artificial neural networks","Speech","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech emotion recognition system","genetic algorithm","neural network","discrete emotional states","anger","disgust","fear","joy","neutral","sadness","surprise","steepest descent method","global search","optimal weight"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["emotion recognition","speech signal","neural network","genetic algorithm (GA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IASP.2011.6109110","pdfPath":"/iel5/6096320/6108985/06109110.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","startPage":"578","endPage":"582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2011.6109110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech emotion recognition system based on genetic algorithm and neural network","abstract":"This paper describes a new speech emotion recognition system aimed at improving the speech emotion recognition rate.

In this paper, we focus on the security issues of cloud services and present a forensic framework to beat cybercrime. We set an analysis engine in the cloud as a network service and this engine is used to monitor the network behaviors and collect the evidence when network criminal behaviors happen.

The use of hardware-event sampling overcomes these drawbacks by providing a lightweight approach to collect execution profiles in the production environment, which naturally consumes representative input. Yet, hardware event samples are typically not precise at the instruction or basic-block granularity. These inaccuracies lead to missed performance when compared to instrumentation-based FDO. In this paper, we use Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU)-based sampling to collect the instruction frequency profiles. By collecting profiles using multiple events, and applying heuristics to predict the accuracy, we improve the accuracy of the profile. We also show how emerging techniques can be used to further improve the accuracy of the sample-based profile. Additionally, these emerging techniques are used to collect value profiles, as well as to assist a lightweight interprocedural optimizer. All these profiles are represented in a portable form, thus they can be used across different platforms. We demonstrate that sampling-based FDO can achieve an average of 92 percent of the performance gains obtained using instrumentation-based exact profiles for both SPEC CINT2000 and CINT2006 benchmarks. The overhead of collection is only 0.93 percent on average, while compiler-based instrumentation incurs 2.0-351.5 percent overhead (and 10x overhead on an industrial web search application).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Radiation detectors","Optimization","Hardware","Phasor measurement units","Monitoring","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimising compilers","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-event sampling","feedback directed optimization","dual-compilation model","instrumentation-based FDO","performance monitoring unit","PMU-based sampling","instruction frequency profile","lightweight interprocedural optimizer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sample profile","feedback directed optimization","performance counter","last branch record"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6389666/06109233.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Taming Hardware Event Samples for Precise and Versatile Feedback Directed Optimizations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Taming Hardware Event Samples for Precise and Versatile Feedback Directed Optimizations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109233/","volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6109233/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13188458","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Taming Hardware Event Samples for Precise and Versatile Feedback Directed Optimizations","sourcePdf":"ttc2013020376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09627S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6389666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6389666","articleId":"6109233","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6109239,"authors":[{"name":"Florentine Dubois","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, CNRS/Grenoble-INP, UJF, Grenoble, France","TIMA Laboratory, CNRS/Grenoble-INP/UJF, GRENOBLE Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6425383/6109239/6109239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":[]},"firstName":"Florentine","lastName":"Dubois","id":"37720262100"},{"name":"Abbas Sheibanyrad","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, CNRS/Grenoble-INP, UJF, Grenoble, France","TIMA Laboratory, CNRS/Grenoble-INP/UJF, GRENOBLE Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6425383/6109239/6109239-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":[]},"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Sheibanyrad","id":"37300108100"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric P\u00e9trot","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6425383/6109239/6109239-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":[]},"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"P\u00e9trot","id":"37330684800"},{"name":"Maryam Bahmani","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, CNRS/Grenoble-INP, UJF, Grenoble, France","TIMA Laboratory, CNRS/Grenoble-INP/UJF, GRENOBLE Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6425383/6109239/6109239-photo-4-source-small.gif","p":[]},"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Bahmani","id":"37646098700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"6109239","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1738},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a distributed routing algorithm for vertically partially connected regular 2D topologies of different shapes and sizes (e.g., 2D mesh, torus, ring). The topologies that are the target of this algorithm are of practical interest in the 3D integration of heterogeneous dies using Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs). Indeed, TSV-based 3D integration allows to envision the stacking of dies with different functions and technologies, using as an interconnect backbone a 3D-NoC. Intrinsically, 3D topologies have better performances, but yield and active area (and thus the cost) are function of the number of TSVs; therefore, the designs tend to use only a subset of available TSVs between two dies. The definition of blockage free and low implementation cost distributed deterministic routing on this kind of topology is thus of theoretical and practical interests. We formally prove that independently of the shape and dimensions of the planar topologies and of the number and placement of the TSVs, the proposed routing algorithm using two virtual channels in the plane is deadlock and livelock free. We also experimentally show that the performance of this algorithm is still acceptable when the number of vertical connections decreases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6425383/06109239.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elevator-First: A Deadlock-Free Distributed Routing Algorithm for Vertically Partially Connected 3D-NoCs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Topology","System recovery","Network topology","Three dimensional displays","Elevators","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","network-on-chip","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadlock-free distributed routing algorithm","vertically partially connected 3D-NoC","vertically partially connected regular 2D topologies","through-silicon-vias","TSV-based 3D integration","interconnect backbone","3D topologies","blockage free","low implementation cost distributed deterministic routing","virtual channels","livelock free","deadlock free","planar topologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Keywords\u20143D Integration","network-on-chip (NoC)","routing algorithm","deadlock freedom"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Elevator-First: A Deadlock-Free Distributed Routing Algorithm for Vertically Partially Connected 3D-NoCs","volume":"62","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6109239/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13270611","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevator-First: A Deadlock-Free Distributed Routing Algorithm for Vertically Partially Connected 3D-NoCs","sourcePdf":"ttc2013030609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065439S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6425383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6425383","articleId":"6109239","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6109245,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6389666/6109245/6109245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cong Wang is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at City University of Hong Kong.

However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in cloud computing a formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources. Moreover, users should be able to just use the cloud storage as if it is local, without worrying about the need to verify its integrity. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud storage is of critical importance so that users can resort to a third-party auditor (TPA) to check the integrity of outsourced data and be worry free. To securely introduce an effective TPA, the auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities toward user data privacy, and introduce no additional online burden to user. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud storage system supporting privacy-preserving public auditing. We further extend our result to enable the TPA to perform audits for multiple users simultaneously and efficiently. Extensive security and performance analysis show the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient. Our preliminary experiment conducted on Amazon EC2 instance further demonstrates the fast performance of the design.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.245","startPage":"362","endPage":"375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6389666/06109245.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Public Auditing for Secure Cloud Storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Public Auditing for Secure Cloud Storage","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188463","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6109245/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Public Auditing for Secure Cloud Storage","sourcePdf":"ttc2013020362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.25784S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6389666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"641","xplore-issue":"6389666","articleId":"6109245","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6109246,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Oma\u00f1a","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Bologna"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6425383/6109246/6109246-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Oma\u00f1a received the degree in electronic engineering from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2000.

A key challenge faced by data-intensive WSNs is to transmit all the data generated within an application's lifetime to the base station despite the fact that sensor nodes have limited power supplies. We propose using low-cost disposable mobile relays to reduce the energy consumption of data-intensive WSNs. Our approach differs from previous work in two main aspects. First, it does not require complex motion planning of mobile nodes, so it can be implemented on a number of low-cost mobile sensor platforms. Second, we integrate the energy consumption due to both mobility and wireless transmissions into a holistic optimization framework. Our framework consists of three main algorithms. The first algorithm computes an optimal routing tree assuming no nodes can move. The second algorithm improves the topology of the routing tree by greedily adding new nodes exploiting mobility of the newly added nodes. The third algorithm improves the routing tree by relocating its nodes without changing its topology. This iterative algorithm converges on the optimal position for each node given the constraint that the routing tree topology does not change. We present efficient distributed implementations for each algorithm that require only limited, localized synchronization. Because we do not necessarily compute an optimal topology, our final routing tree is not necessarily optimal. However, our simulation results show that our algorithms significantly outperform the best existing solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Relay Configuration in Data-Intensive Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.266","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6387244/06109264.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Relay Configuration in Data-Intensive Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6109264/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13189891","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Relay Configuration in Data-Intensive Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013020261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052701S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6387244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"55","articleId":"6109264","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6109266,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Manweiler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical and Computing Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6172599/6109266/6109266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Justin Manweiler received the BS degree from The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, in 2007, and is currently working toward the PhD degree in computer science at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.

This paper observes that, despite a rich body of research in WiFi energy management, there is room for improvement. Our key finding is that WiFi energy optimizations have conventionally been designed with a single AP in mind. However, network contention among different APs can dramatically increase a client's energy consumption. Each client may have to keep awake for long durations before its own AP gets a chance to send it packets to it. As AP density increases, the waiting time inflates, resulting in a proportional decrease in battery life. We design SleepWell, a system that achieves energy efficiency by evading network contention. The APs regulate the sleeping window of their clients in a way that different APs are active/inactive during nonoverlapping time windows. The solution is analogous to the common wisdom of going late to office and coming back late, thereby avoiding the rush hours. We implement SleepWell on a testbed of eight Laptops and nine Android phones, and evaluate it over a wide variety of scenarios and traffic patterns. Results show a median gain of up to 2x when WiFi links are strong; when links are weak and the network density is high, the gains can be even more.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.269","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6172599/06109266.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6172599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"739","endPage":"752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avoiding the Rush Hours: WiFi Energy Management via Traffic Isolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Avoiding the Rush Hours: WiFi Energy Management via Traffic Isolation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109266/","volume":"11","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6109266/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12617768","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avoiding the Rush Hours: WiFi Energy Management via Traffic Isolation","sourcePdf":"ttm2012050739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114506S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6172599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6172599","articleId":"6109266","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6109282,"authors":[{"name":"Tanaya Guha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6218247/6109282/6109282-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tanaya Guha is currently working toward the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Although this work concentrates on recognizing human movements-physical actions as well as facial expressions-the proposed approach is fairly general and can be used to address other classification problems. In order to model human actions, three overcomplete dictionary learning frameworks are investigated. An overcomplete dictionary is constructed using a set of spatio-temporal descriptors (extracted from the video sequences) in such a way that each descriptor is represented by some linear combination of a small number of dictionary elements. This leads to a more compact and richer representation of the video sequences compared to the existing methods that involve clustering and vector quantization. For each framework, a novel classification algorithm is proposed. Additionally, this work also presents the idea of a new local spatio-temporal feature that is distinctive, scale invariant, and fast to compute. The proposed approach repeatedly achieves state-of-the-art results on several public data sets containing various physical actions and facial expressions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6218247/06109282.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6218247","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Sparse Representations for Human Action Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Vectors","Feature extraction","Videos","Detectors","Video sequences","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionaries","face recognition","gesture recognition","image classification","image representation","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering","vector quantisation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse representation","human action recognition","human movement recognition","physical action","facial expression","classification problem","human action model","overcomplete dictionary learning framework","spatio-temporal descriptor","video sequence representation","dictionary element","clustering","vector quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Action recognition","dictionary learning","expression recognition","overcomplete","orthogonal matching pursuit","sparse representation","spatio-temporal descriptors."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Dancing","Databases, Factual","Facial Expression","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Models, Theoretical","Movement","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Sports","Terminology as Topic","Video Recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning Sparse Representations for Human Action Recognition","volume":"34","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6109282/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12786767","pubMedId":"22745001","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Sparse Representations for Human Action Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2012081576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127197S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6218247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"244","xplore-issue":"6218247","articleId":"6109282","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6109297,"authors":[{"name":"Ziad A.

A game in SF models the case where players are uniquely interested in the satisfaction of some individual performance constraints, instead of individual performance optimization. Under this formulation, the notion of equilibrium corresponds to the situation where all players can simultaneously satisfy their individual constraints. The notion of SE, models the problem of QoS provisioning in decentralized self-configuring networks. Here, radio devices are satisfied if they are able to provide the requested QoS. Within this framework, the concept of SE is formalized for both pure and mixed strategies considering finite sets of players and actions. In both cases, sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the SE are presented. When multiple SE exist, we introduce the idea of effort or cost of satisfaction and we propose a refinement of the SE, namely the efficient SE (ESE). At the ESE, all players adopt the action which requires the lowest effort for satisfaction. A learning method that allows radio devices to achieve a SE in pure strategies in finite time and requiring only one-bit feedback is also presented. Finally, a power control game in the interference channel is used to highlight the advantages of modeling QoS problems following the notion of SE rather than other equilibrium concepts, e.g., generalized Nash equilibrium.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6167334/06109304.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2180507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2180507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6167334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-Of-Service Provisioning in Decentralized Networks: A Satisfaction Equilibrium Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Quality of service","Context","Vectors","Radio transmitters","Probability distribution","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","power control","quality of service","radiocommunication","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality-of-service provisioning","decentralized self-configuring networks","satisfaction equilibrium approach","game formulation","satisfaction form","SF model","performance constraints","performance optimization","SE model","QoS provisioning","radio devices","efficient-SE approach","ESE approach","learning method","one-bit feedback","power control game","interference channel","generalized Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adhoc networks","decentralized networks","game theory","quality-of-service","satisfaction equilibrium","self-configuring devices","strategic learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Quality-Of-Service Provisioning in Decentralized Networks: A Satisfaction Equilibrium Approach","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6109304/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578207","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-Of-Service Provisioning in Decentralized Networks: A Satisfaction Equilibrium Approach","sourcePdf":"jstsp-perlaza-2180507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137963S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6167334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6167334","articleId":"6109304","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6109307,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Kasai","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Aoba-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kasai","id":"37301698100"},{"name":"David Odeke Otuya","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Aoba-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"David Odeke","lastName":"Otuya","id":"38233177200"},{"name":"Masato Yoshida","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Aoba-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37293216900"},{"name":"Toshihiko Hirooka","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Aoba-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Hirooka","id":"37284852000"},{"name":"Masataka Nakazawa","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Aoba-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Nakazawa","id":"37273573700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6109307","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"We report the single-carrier 800-Gb/s coherent transmission of polarization-multiplexed 32 return-to-zero (RZ)/quadrature amplitude modulation signals at 10 Gsymbol/s \u00d7 8 optical time-division multiplexing (OTDM).

Pattern diversity is obtained by feeding the antenna simultaneously with two microstrip lines printed on the back of the substrate, which generate orthogonal radiation patterns. Two shorts placed at 45 degrees between the microstrip lines and in the opposite direction ensure an isolation above 15 dB according to measurements. The antenna operates in the range of frequencies from 3 GHz to 12 GHz (1:4 bandwidth) and covers many different standards (Wireless-LAN, HIPERLAN2, WIMAX, UWB). Simulations and measurements for return loss, isolation and radiation patterns are presented. Furthermore, measurements have been carried out in a real multipath environment in order to evaluate pattern diversity performance. Results of measurements of the correlation coefficient and diversity gain over the entire operating bandwidth show that the antenna is suitable for antenna diversity systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6159229/06109317.pdf","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2180314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2180314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Broadband Pattern Diversity Annular Slot Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Antenna measurements","Slot antennas","Bandwidth","Antenna radiation patterns","Broadband antennas","Microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","loop antennas","microstrip lines","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband pattern diversity annular slot antenna","wideband applications","antenna feed","microstrip lines","orthogonal radiation patterns","wireless LAN","HIPERLAN2","WiMAX","UWB","return loss","isolation pattern","radiation pattern","correlation coefficient","diversity gain","antenna diversity systems","frequency 3 GHz to 12 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband antenna","pattern diversity","slot antennas","ultra wide band (UWB) antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Broadband Pattern Diversity Annular Slot Antenna","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6109317/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571336","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Broadband Pattern Diversity Annular Slot Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-antoninodaviu-2180314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091899S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6159229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6159229","articleId":"6109317","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6109319,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37537320000"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280171800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6109319","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2063},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Dielectric resonator antennas","Dielectrics","Wideband","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","conformal antennas","dielectric resonator antennas","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact asymmetrical T-shaped dielectric resonator antenna","broadband applications","inverted-trapezoidal patch","feeding mechanism","impedance bandwidth","dielectric wavelength","conformal patch-excited wideband DRA designs","frequency 3.81 GHz to 8.39 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact","dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","inverted trapezoidal patch","wideband"]}],"abstract":"A compact dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) for broadband applications is proposed.

Designs in which the diode ohmic anode has an overhanging Schottky extension (composite anode contact) are shown to result in a significantly reduced amount of impact ionization, as compared with a simple ohmic contact design. The EL results are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations, which show a reduced impact ionization in composite anode contact devices due to a reduced electron density beneath the anode Schottky extension that, on the one hand, weakens the Gunn domain electric field and softens its variations near the anode edge, and, on the other hand, reduces the number of electrons capable of generating holes by impact ionization. A comparison between standard and composite anode contact approaches in terms of radio-frequency operation of the devices is made showing oscillations up to 109 GHz with an output power of -5 dBm in devices featuring the composite anode contact and no oscillations from all-ohmic contact devices. The findings reported in this paper may be useful not only for the design and the fabrication of planar Gunn diodes but also for other devices such as high-electron-mobility transistors where impact ionization can result in reliability limitations.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2177094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2177094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6155188/06109337.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Impact Ionization in GaAs-Based Planar Gunn Diodes by Anode Contact Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Impact Ionization in GaAs-Based Planar Gunn Diodes by Anode Contact Design","volume":"59","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6109337/","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543160","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109337/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Impact Ionization in GaAs-Based Planar Gunn Diodes by Anode Contact Design","sourcePdf":"ted-montes-2177094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106228S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6155188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6155188","articleId":"6109337","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6109344,"authors":[{"name":"Wenling Li","affiliation":["Seventh Research Division and the Department of Systems and Control, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6220909/6109344/6109344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenling Li was born in Shandong, China.

Current approaches do this by making use of adaptive media playout (AMP) to reduce the playout rate. However, this introduces playout distortion to the viewers and increases the viewing latency. We approach this by proposing a frame rate optimization framework that adjusts both the encoder frame generation rate and the decoder playout frame rate. Firstly, we model this problem as the joint adjustment of the encoder frame generation interval and the decoder playout frame interval. This model is used with a discontinuity penalty virtual buffer to track the accumulated difference between the receiving frame interval and the playout frame interval. We then apply Lyapunov optimization to the model to systematically derive a pair of decoupled optimization policies. We show that the occupancy of the discontinuity penalty virtual buffer is correlated to the video discontinuity and that this framework produces a very low playout distortion in addition to a significant reduction in the prebuffering requirements compared to existing approaches. Secondly, we introduced a delay constraint into the framework by using a delay accumulator virtual buffer. Simulation results show that the delay constrained framework provides a superior tradeoff between the video quality and the delay introduced compared to the existing approach. Finally, we analyzed the impact of delayed feedback between the receiver and the sender on the optimization policies. We show that the delayed feedbacks have a minimal impact on the optimization policies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2180706","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2180706","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6198816/06109351.pdf","startPage":"910","endPage":"922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Frame Rate Optimization Framework for Improving Continuity in Video Streaming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Frame Rate Optimization Framework for Improving Continuity in Video Streaming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12725020","dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6109351/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Frame Rate Optimization Framework for Improving Continuity in Video Streaming","sourcePdf":"tmm-tan-2180706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073614S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6198816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6198816","articleId":"6109351","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6109360,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Wang","affiliation":["Toshiba Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Wang","id":"38240471400"},{"name":"Yue Wang","affiliation":["Toshiba Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"38582922600"},{"name":"Justin P.

We propose an optimal spectrum sensing and access mechanism such that the average energy cost of the SU, which includes the energy consumed by spectrum sensing, channel switching, and data transmission, is minimized, whereas multiple constraints on the reliability of sensing, the throughput, and the delay of the secondary transmission are satisfied. Optimality is achieved by jointly considering two fundamental tradeoffs involved in energy minimization, i.e., the sensing/transmission tradeoff and the wait/switch tradeoff. An efficient convex optimization procedure is developed to solve for the optimal values of the sensing slot duration and the channel switching probability. The advantages of the proposed spectrum sensing and access mechanism are shown through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2180549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06109360.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2180549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"906","endPage":"912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Sensing and Access for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6109360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Sensing and Access for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109360/","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6109360/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12527202","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Sensing and Access for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2180549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098671S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6109360","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6109362,"authors":[{"name":"Ikbal Ali","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Academy of Technology, Hooghly, India"],"firstName":"Ikbal","lastName":"Ali","id":"37083866000"},{"name":"Abhijit Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Academy of Technology, Hooghly, India"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37400365800"},{"name":"Arindum Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Academy of Technology, Hooghly, India"],"firstName":"Arindum","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37404076200"},{"name":"B.

The framework is based on the so-called generalized mutual information (GMI), and the analysis in particular benefits from the setup of Gaussian codebook ensemble and nearest-neighbor decoding, for which it is established that the GMI takes a general form analogous to the channel capacity of undistorted Gaussian channels, with a reduced \"effective\" signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that depends on the nominal SNR and the distortion model. When applied to specific distortion models, an array of results of engineering relevance is obtained. For channels with transmit-side distortion only, it is shown that a conventional approach, which treats the distorted signal as the sum of the original signal part and a uncorrelated distortion part, achieves the GMI. For channels with output quantization, closed-form expressions are obtained for the effective SNR and the GMI, and related optimization problems are formulated and solved for quantizer design. Finally, super-Nyquist sampling is analyzed within the general framework, and it is shown that sampling beyond the Nyquist rate increases the GMI for all SNR values. For example, with binary symmetric output quantization, information rates exceeding one bit per channel use are achievable by sampling the output at four times the Nyquist rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","volume":"60","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12525150","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6109374/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A General Framework for Transmission with Transceiver Distortion and Some Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Framework for Transmission with Transceiver Distortion and Some Applications","sourcePdf":"384-tc1202-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093175S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6109374","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6109375,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Huang","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6149856/6109375/6109375-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Huang received the B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, in 2007, and the M.S. degree from the University of Notre Dame (ND), Notre Dame, IN, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.

The channel state information (CSI) is not known a priori at either the transmitter or the receiver. Channel estimation is performed through a combination of conventional pilots and manufactured pilots from previously decoded data. The paper examines how different interleaver structures affect the tradeoff between achievable rates, delay and complexity. When there is no delay constraint at all, the conventional pilots can be eliminated completely and a proper interleaving scheme can convert half the symbols into manufactured pilots. When there is a delay constraint, the paper explores various interleaver structures that combine the conventional pilots with the manufactured pilots in different ways to get much better achievable rates than conventional pilot-symbol aided channel estimation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6149856/06109375.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"111","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121211.100044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121211.100044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6149856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interleaver Structures for Channel Estimation and Decoding on the Frequency Selective Fading Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6109375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","displayDocTitle":"Interleaver Structures for Channel Estimation and Decoding on the Frequency Selective Fading Channel","htmlLink":"/document/6109375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12527276","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interleaver Structures for Channel Estimation and Decoding on the Frequency Selective Fading Channel","sourcePdf":"101-tc1201-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080014S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6149856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"6149856","articleId":"6109375","onlineDate":"20 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"}]
