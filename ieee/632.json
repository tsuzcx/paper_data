To address the current spectrum scarcity problem, next generation wireless networks are required to be comprising of intelligent and reconfigurable radios (popularly known as Cognitive Radios (CRs)) that can interact with their continuously changing environment to capture real time spectrum awareness and avail any spectrum usage opportunity. Dynamic and opportunistic spectrum access is identified as an enabling technology for Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Network (CROWN) wherein low-priority secondary users (CRs) are allowed to communicate over licensed frequency bands when the legacy users of that spectrum are not fully utilizing it. As most of the spectrum is already allocated to primary users with exclusive legacy rights of the frequency bands, the key challenge for CROWN is to reuse/share licensed spectrum without interfering with primary transmissions. This paper highlights fundamental challenges in getting multi-dimensional spectrum awareness under practical constraints and provides viable solutions. Furthermore, limitations of both transmitter detection based non-cooperative spectrum sensing techniques and cooperative sensing strategies are discussed, open research challenges are investigated and possible solutions are presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320104","startPage":"992","endPage":"997","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308061/6320104/06320105.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio oriented wireless networks: Challenges and solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6320105/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio oriented wireless networks: Challenges and solutions","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058177","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio oriented wireless networks: Challenges and solutions","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"icmcs12submission601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093396S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308061","isNumber":"6320104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308061","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6320104","articleId":"6320105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6320107,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Simulations of the proposed algorithm are encouraging for very short CPU time.","doi":"10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320157","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1124","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320104","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308061/6320104/06320157.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new multi-objective particle swarm optimization for reactive power dispatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320157/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new multi-objective particle swarm optimization for reactive power dispatch","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320157/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13058225","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multi-objective particle swarm optimization for reactive power dispatch","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"icmcs12submission114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050673S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308061","isNumber":"6320104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308061","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6320104","articleId":"6320157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6320194,"authors":[{"name":"Salima El Makhtari","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Technologies de l'lnformation et de la Communication, Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliquees, Tangier, Morocco"],"firstName":"Salima","lastName":"El Makhtari","id":"37087681326"},{"name":"Mohamed Moussaoui","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Technologies de l'lnformation et de la Communication, Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliquees, Tangier, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Moussaoui","id":"37398872100"},{"name":"Hassan Samadi","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Technologies de l'lnformation et de la Communication, Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliquees, Tangier, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Samadi","id":"37089045612"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1520-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1518-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1519-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6320194","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"abstract":"This paper presents a performance evaluation of OFDM LTE downlink physical layer according to the latest 3GPP specifications.

The principle of this approach is to search code words locally around the all-zero code word perturbed by a level of noise magnitude, in other words the maximum of noise that can be corrected by a Soft-In decoder, anticipating that the resultant nearest non-zero code words will most likely contain the minimum Hamming weight code word, whose Hamming weight is equal to the minimum distance of the linear code. A numerous results prove that the proposed algorithm is valid for general linear codes and it is very fast comparing to all others known techniques, therefore it is a good tool for computing. Comparing to Joanna's works, we proof that our algorithm has a low complexity with a fast time of execution. For some linear RQs, QDCs and BCHs codes with unknown minimum distance, we give a good estimation (true) of the minimum distance where the length is less than 439.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308061/6320104/06320261.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient method to find the minimum distance of linear block codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Codecs","Binary phase shift keying","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","block codes","decoding","Hamming codes","linear codes","optimisation","residue codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum distance","linear block codes","NP-hard problems","code word search","all-zero code word","noise magnitude","soft-in decoder","nonzero code words","minimum Hamming weight code word","Joanna works","linear RQ codes","QDC codes","BCH codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear codes","Minimum Distance","Soft-In decode","NP-hardness","Quadratic Residue codes","Quadratic Double-Circulant Codes","BCH Codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"An efficient method to find the minimum distance of linear block codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320261/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058329","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method to find the minimum distance of linear block codes","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"icmcs12submission363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064101S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308061","isNumber":"6320104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308061","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6320104","articleId":"6320261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6320263,"authors":[{"name":"Hayet Boughrara","affiliation":["Intelligent Control, design and Optimization of complex Systems (ICOS), Sfax Engineering School BP W, Sfax, Sfax"],"firstName":"Hayet","lastName":"Boughrara","id":"37640786700"},{"name":"Mohamed Chtourou","affiliation":["Intelligent Control, design and Optimization of complex Systems (ICOS), Sfax Engineering School BP W, Sfax, Sfax"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Chtourou","id":"37547698000"},{"name":"Chokri Ben Amar","affiliation":["Research Group on Intelligent Machines (REGIM), Sfax Engineering School BP W, Sfax"],"firstName":"Chokri Ben","lastName":"Amar","id":"37659658600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1520-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1518-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1519-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6320263","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":837},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Neurons","Gabor filters","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","mean square error methods","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MLP neural network based face recognition system","constructive training algorithm","computer authentication","pattern recognition","feature extraction algorithms","Gabor features","Zernike moment","human face images","multilayer perceptron","incremental training procedure","hidden-layer","neural network training","mean square error","MSE","training data","TD","UMIST database","neural network classifier","back-propagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","constructive training algorithm","MLP neural network","Feature extraction","Zernike Moment","Gabor feature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320263","abstract":"Face recognition is one of the most efficient applications of computer authentication and pattern recognition. Therefore it attracts significant attention of researchers. In the past decades, many feature extraction algorithms have been proposed. In this paper Gabor features and Zernike moment were used to extract features from human face images for recognition application. This paper is a study for new constructive training algorithm for Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) which is applied to face recognition application. An incremental training procedure was employed where the training patterns are learned incrementally. This algorithm started with a single training pattern and a single hidden-layer using one neuron. During neural network training, the hidden neuron is increased when the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the Training Data (TD) is not reduced or the algorithm gets stuck in a local minimum. Input patterns are trained incrementally (one by one) until all patterns of TD are selected and trained. Face recognition system structure based on a MLP neural network was constructed and was tested for face recognition. The proposed approach was tested on the UMIST database. Experimental results indicate that we can obtain an optimal architecture of neural network classifier (with the least possible number of hidden neuron) using our present constructive algorithm, and prove the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the MLP architecture with back-propagation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320263","startPage":"233","endPage":"238","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320104","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308061/6320104/06320263.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MLP neural network based face recognition system using constructive training algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320263/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MLP neural network based face recognition system using constructive training algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320263/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13058331","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MLP neural network based face recognition system using constructive training algorithm","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"icmcs12submission371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095395S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308061","isNumber":"6320104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308061","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6320104","articleId":"6320263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6320278,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Mohammadpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Fasa, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Mohammadpour","id":"37646315300"},{"name":"Masoud Rostampour","affiliation":["Member of Young Researcher of Club, Fasa, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Rostampour","id":"38489015300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1520-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1518-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1519-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6320278","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":886},"abstract":"In this paper a novel compensation method for low power two-stage operational Amplifiers is proposed.

However, in open cloud systems, security of computation becomes a great challenge. Moreover, MapReduce data-processing services are long-running, which increase the opportunity that an adversary launches attack to the workers and make them behave maliciously and, then tamper with the computation integrity of user tasks where their executions are generally performed in different administration domains out of the user control. Thus, the results of the computation might be erroneous and dishonest. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism based on weighted t-first voting method for ensuring the integrity of MapReduce in open cloud computing environment. Our mechanism can defeat both collusive and non-collusive malicious entities and thus guarantee high computation accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new mechanism to ensure integrity for MapReduce in cloud computing","doi":"10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320295","startPage":"785","endPage":"790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320104","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308061/6320104/06320295.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A new mechanism to ensure integrity for MapReduce in cloud computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320295/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058362","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new mechanism to ensure integrity for MapReduce in cloud computing","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"icmcs12submission441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089399S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308061","isNumber":"6320104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308061","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6320104","articleId":"6320295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6320299,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelali El Bouchti","affiliation":["Computer, Networks, Mobility and Modeling laboratory, e-NGN research group, Africa and Middle East FST, Hassan 1 University, Settat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Abdelali","lastName":"El Bouchti","id":"37705884300"},{"name":"Abdelkrim Haqiq","affiliation":["Computer, Networks, Mobility and Modeling laboratory, e-NGN research group, Africa and Middle East FST, Hassan 1 University, Settat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Abdelkrim","lastName":"Haqiq","id":"37601296600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1520-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1518-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1519-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6320299","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Queueing analysis","OFDM","Quality of service","Approximation methods","Radio spectrum management","Servers","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","Markov processes","queueing theory","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAC mechanism","OFDMA system","shadow server approximation","queueing theory","OFDMA based WiMAX","high priority connections","low priority connections","mixed priority strategy","single cell WiMAX","subchannel allocation","subscriber stations","quality of service","connection admission control","connection arrival","packet arrival","Markov modulated Poisson process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiMAX","OFDMA","MMPP","Queueing Theory","QoS","Shadow Server","Performance Measures"]}],"abstract":"We study in this paper the problem of queueing theoretic of OFDMA-based WiMAX with two classes of connections, connections with High Priority (HP) and connections with Low Priority (LP). The key idea to solve the problem of the mixed priority strategy is the technique of the Shadow server approximation. Specifically, we present a single-cell WiMAX environment in which the base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in its coverage area. The subchannels allocated to a subscriber station are shared by multiple connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) performances, a Connection Admission Control (CAC) mechanism is considered at a subscriber station. Then, based on the queueing model, both the connection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and compared with their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled by a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). Several performance measures are derived.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance measures of CAC mechanism in OFDMA system using shadow server approximation","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320299","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6308061/6320104/06320299.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance measures of CAC mechanism in OFDMA system using shadow server approximation","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320299/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13058366","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance measures of CAC mechanism in OFDMA system using shadow server approximation","confLoc":"Tangiers, Morocco","sourcePdf":"icmcs12submission447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06588S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6308061","isNumber":"6320104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6308061","xplore-issue":"6320104","articleId":"6320299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6320303,"authors":[{"name":"Hanan El Faylali","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hanan","lastName":"El Faylali","id":"37085944597"},{"name":"Mohamed Iben Yaich","affiliation":["Electronic and Microwaves Group, Faculty ojSciences, Abdelmalek Essadi University, Tetouan, Morocco","Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Iben Yaich","id":"37331590000"},{"name":"Mohsine Khalladi","affiliation":["Electronic and Microwaves Group, Faculty ojSciences, Abdelmalek Essadi University, Tetouan, Morocco","Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohsine","lastName":"Khalladi","id":"37331594600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1520-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1518-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1519-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6320303","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Mathematical model","Lasers","Spontaneous emission","Equations","Time domain analysis","Microwave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SCN-TLM simulation","Femtosecond optical","four level two electron atomic system","Pauli exclusion principle","electromagnetic wave propagation","simulation model","time-domain transmission line matrix","TLM method","symmetrical condensed node","SCN","coupled rate equations","dynamic pumping","scattering matrix","TLM formulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear wave propagation","TLM method","Pauli Exclusion Principle","Atomic media"]}],"abstract":"A simulation model of electromagnetic wave's propagation, in four-level two-electron atomic systems is presented in this work.

They are based on asymmetric source and drain structures and include Asymmetric Drain Spacer Extension (ADSE) and Asymmetric Doped Drain (ADD) FinFETs. The study includes two recently introduced 6-T SRAM cells based on these structures. In addition, we propose four transistor driverless (4-TDL) and loadless (4-TLL) SRAM cells based on these asymmetric structures. In the investigation, which compares the structures, the effect of different channel orientations is also considered. The results indicate that for 6-T, 4-TDL, and 4-TLL with different channel orientations asymmetric structures have higher read stabilities than the symmetric ones. In addition, the channel orientation (100) presents a higher read stability for 4-TLL while the channel orientation (110) gives rise to a better read stability for 6-T and 4-TDL. Asymmetric structures, however, have lower read currents where the ADSE structure leads to the least one. In terms of write operation, the asymmetric structures present better stability where 4-T cells outperform the 6-T cell. Finally, the results on static power shows that the ADD FinFET structure provides the lowest static power values due to a better DIBL control.","publicationTitle":"2012 4th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310182/6320457/06320473.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power and robust SRAM cells based on asymmetric FinFET structures","doi":"10.1109/ACQED.2012.6320473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACQED.2012.6320473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low-power and robust SRAM cells based on asymmetric FinFET structures","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13037555","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6320473/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power and robust SRAM cells based on asymmetric FinFET structures","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1B3076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057185S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310182","isNumber":"6320457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310182","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6320457","articleId":"6320473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6320474,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Khosropour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Khosropour","id":"37713795100"},{"name":"Seyed-Ali Kashani-Gharavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed-Ali","lastName":"Kashani-Gharavi","id":"38489275100"},{"name":"Reza Asadpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Asadpour","id":"38490011900"},{"name":"Ali Afzali-Kusha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afzali-Kusha","id":"38270948500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2688-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2687-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2686-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6320474","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Measurement","Transistors","Random variables","Threshold voltage","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit reliability","low-power electronics","MOSFET","probability","regression analysis","SRAM chips","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NBTI effect","low-power 6T SRAM cell","process variation tolerant design","negative bias temperature instability","failure probability","statistical distributions methodology","SRAM reliability metric","static noise margin","SNM","read current","nonlinear regression","transistor","static power consumption","SRAM block leakage distribution estimation","CMOS technology","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)","process variation","statistical design","Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a statistical methodology for the design of process variation tolerant yet low-power 6T SRAM cells. In addition to process variations, Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has been included in the design methodology such that the time dependence of the failure probability is taken into account. To increase the modeling accuracy of the statistical distributions of different SRAM reliability metrics such as static noise margin (SNM) and Read Current, a modeling scheme based on nonlinear regression is suggested. The design technique, which minimizes the failure probabilities due to the process variations, considers the widths and lengths of the six transistors of the cell as design parameters. The sizes of the transistors are selected such that the area constraint is not violated. Also, to include the static power consumption of the SRAM block in the design methodology, we introduce a method for estimating the SRAM block leakage distribution. To show the efficacy of the technique, the results of applying this methodology for a 45 nm CMOS technology are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ACQED.2012.6320474","publicationTitle":"2012 4th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310182/6320457/06320474.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACQED.2012.6320474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320457","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process variation tolerant SRAM cell design using additive model considering NBTI effect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320474/","displayDocTitle":"Process variation tolerant SRAM cell design using additive model considering NBTI effect","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320474/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13037556","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process variation tolerant SRAM cell design using additive model considering NBTI effect","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1B4085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058564S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310182","isNumber":"6320457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310182","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6320457","articleId":"6320474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6320476,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Fang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ya-Fang Cheng","id":"38489423400"},{"name":"Li-Yu Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li-Yu Chan","id":"37534027900"},{"name":"Yen-Lung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Lung Chen","id":"37539672900"},{"name":"Yu-Ching Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Ching Liao","id":"38489081000"},{"name":"Chien-Nan Jimmy Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Nan Jimmy Liu","id":"37280629100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2688-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2687-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2686-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6320476","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Mathematical model","Integrated circuit modeling","Equations","Accuracy","Circuit optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","operational amplifiers","optimisation","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bias-driven approach","automatic design optimization","CMOS op-amp","equation-based analog design automation","deep-submicron effects","major transistor parameters","transistor parameters","internal voltages","circuit optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sizing","Analog circuits","Automatic design"]}],"abstract":"The equation-based analog design automation is getting popular in last decade to search the optimal solutions with good efficiency.

A PAS transmitter has a PA bank consisting of multiple dissimilar PAs, which operate with different output power levels, and selects the most efficient PA and its power level that satisfies a target rate. If there is no PA supporting the target rate, the transmitter is set to an off-mode (i.e., all PAs are turned off). The receiver feeds back the choice of PA and its power level to the transmitter, similar to the feedback in a conventional power control system with a single PA. Numerical results show that the system EE can be improved by using the PAS. This letter is the first study to investigate and verify the potential capability of PAS for the system EE improvement in wireless communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6473805/06320547.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.092612.120620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.092612.120620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Amplifier Switching (PAS) for Energy Efficient Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Switches","Power demand","Power control","Power amplifiers","Wireless communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","power amplifier bank","power amplifier switching","power amplifier selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Power Amplifier Switching (PAS) for Energy Efficient Systems","volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6320547/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2013","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Amplifier Switching (PAS) for Energy Efficient Systems","sourcePdf":"014-wcl1302-joung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049328S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6473805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6473805","articleId":"6320547","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6320548,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos I.

We propose a novel asymmetrical time-stamping and passive listening (ATPL) protocol for joint clock synchronization and ranging. The ATPL protocol exploits broadcast to not only reduce the number of active transmissions between the nodes, but also to obtain more information. This is used in a simple estimator based on least-squares (LS) to jointly estimate all the unknown clock-skews, clock-offsets, and pairwise distances of the sensor to each anchor. The Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived for the considered problem. The proposed estimator is shown to be asymptotically efficient, meets the CRLB, and also performs better than the available clock synchronization algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13146173","htmlLink":"/document/6320615/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Clock Synchronization and Ranging: Asymmetrical Time-Stamping and Passive Listening","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Clock Synchronization and Ranging: Asymmetrical Time-Stamping and Passive Listening","sourcePdf":"lsp-chepuri-2222371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061896S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6353967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6353967","articleId":"6320615","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6320619,"authors":[{"name":"Xinfan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6578094/6320619/6320619-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinfan Lin received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in automotive engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

Since only the surface temperature of the battery can be measured, a thermal model is needed to estimate the core temperature of the battery, which can be higher and more critical. In this paper, an online parameter identification scheme is designed for a cylindrical lithium ion battery. An adaptive observer of the core temperature is then designed based on the online parameterization methodology and the surface temperature measurement. A battery thermal model with constant internal resistance is explored first. The identification algorithm and the adaptive observer is validated with experiments on a 2.3Ah 26650 lithium iron phosphate/graphite battery. The methodology is later extended to address temperature-dependent internal resistance with nonuniform forgetting factors.

The digital single-loop control based on the grid-side current feedback can attenuate the resonance introduced by LCL filters due to the inherent damping characteristic embedded in the control loop. The stability analysis is performed by means of a Nyquist diagram in the discrete domain and to provide a general design direction for filter and controller. The quantitative relationship of ratios of LCL resonance angular frequency to control frequency and controller parameters on the system stability is investigated. It is derived that the system would obtain preferable stability margin when the ratio is located at a certain range.

Fast and accurate estimation of time-varying harmonics is a key to realize many objectives of the smarter and cleaner grid such as harmonic source identification, improved active filter control for mitigation of harmonics, and smart meters for harmonic pollution metering. This paper presents a fast and accurate approach for real-time estimation of moderate time-varying harmonics of voltage/current signals. The proposed method is based on estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT)-assisted adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN). The AWNN provides quick estimates (twice every fundamental cycle with only half-cycle data as input) of the dominant harmonics, whereas the ESPRIT complements it to handle time-varying signals with higher accuracy. The salient features of the proposed method are validated on the simulated and experimental signals of stationary and time-varying nature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Estimation","Training","Power harmonic filters","Monitoring","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","harmonic distortion","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pollution measurement","power engineering computing","power system harmonics","power system measurement","smart meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast harmonic estimation","time-varying signals","EA-AWNN","harmonic distortion field measurement","power system harmonics monitoring","power system harmonics analysis","power system harmonics control","time-varying harmonics","improved active filter control","harmonics mitigation","harmonic pollution metering","smart meters","real-time estimation","voltage-current signals","signal parameters estimation","rotational invariance technique-assisted adaptive wavelet neural network","ESPRIT-assisted adaptive wavelet neural network","dominant harmonics","stationary signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive learning","adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN)","estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT)","interharmonics","power quality","total harmonic distortion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2217637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6399626/06320629.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2217637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Harmonic Estimation of Stationary and Time-Varying Signals Using EA-AWNN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Harmonic Estimation of Stationary and Time-Varying Signals Using EA-AWNN","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320629/","volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320629/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13191333","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Harmonic Estimation of Stationary and Time-Varying Signals Using EA-AWNN","sourcePdf":"tim-jain-2217637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178169S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6399626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6399626","articleId":"6320629","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6320653,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Hajian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Mahdi Hajian (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2005, the M.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2012.","His research interests are in stochastic optimizations and control of power systems."]},"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Hajian","id":"38347490200"},{"name":"William D.

The reason is that high-penetration controllable load may have substantial impact on system frequency response (SFR). However, the effect of the frequency-related load-damping coefficient is still not completely understood. This paper investigates the effect of frequency-sensitive load on system frequency using typical SFR model. Theoretic analyses based on transfer functions show that the frequency deviation under a different load-damping coefficient is relatively small and bounded when the power system is essentially stable; while the frequency deviation can be accelerated when a power system is unstable after disturbance. For the stable case, the largest frequency dip under a perturbation and the corresponding critical time can be derived by inverse Laplace transformation using a full model considering load-damping coefficient. Further, the error in evaluating the load-frequency coefficient gives the largest impact to frequency deviation right at the time when the largest frequency dip occurs. Multiple-machine cases and automatic generation control (AGC) are also included in the analyses with verifications by simulation studies. The conclusion can be useful for system operators for decision-making of load control or interruption.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Automatic generation control","Frequency control","Load modeling","Sensitivity","Transfer functions","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic gain control","decision making","frequency control","Laplace transforms","load regulation","perturbation techniques","power system control","sensitivity analysis","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","load-damping characteristic","power system frequency regulation","smart grid initiative","demand responses","frequency-sensitive loads","system frequency response","frequency-related load-damping coefficient","frequency-sensitive load","SFR model","theoretic analyses","frequency deviation","load-damping coefficient","power system","frequency dip","perturbation","inverse Laplace transformation","load-frequency coefficient","automatic generation control","AGC","decision making","system operators","load control","load interruption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic generation control (AGC)","demand response","frequency drop","frequency sensitive load","load control","sensitivity analysis","system frequency response (SFR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2209901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06320655.pdf","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2209901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Analysis of Load-Damping Characteristic in Power System Frequency Regulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Analysis of Load-Damping Characteristic in Power System Frequency Regulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320655/","volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320655/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13934195","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Analysis of Load-Damping Characteristic in Power System Frequency Regulation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-li-2209901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060081S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6320655","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6320656,"authors":[{"name":"Giacomo Capizzi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics, and Informatics Engineering, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6331030/6320656/6320656-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giacomo Capizzi received the Laurea degree (summa cum laude) in electronic engineering from the University of Catania, Catania, Italy, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the University of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy, in 1993 and 2000, respectively.","He was a Cabling Systems Designer with Itel (a small telecommunications company), from 1993 to 1996. from 2000 to 2002, he was a Lecturer with the Department of Electrical, Electronics, and Systems Engineering, (Now Department of Electrical, Electronics, and Informatics Engineering) University of Catania, where he has been an Assistant Professor since 2002.

This paper deals with the problem of solar radiation prediction based on observed meteorological data. A 2-day forecast is obtained by using novel wavelet recurrent neural networks (WRNNs). In fact, these WRNNS are used to exploit the correlation between solar radiation and timescale-related variations of wind speed, humidity, and temperature. The input to the selected WRNN is provided by timescale-related bands of wavelet coefficients obtained from meteorological time series. The experimental setup available at the University of Catania, Italy, provided this information. The novelty of this approach is that the proposed WRNN performs the prediction in the wavelet domain and, in addition, also performs the inverse wavelet transform, giving the predicted signal as output. The obtained simulation results show a very low root-mean-square error compared to the results of the solar radiation prediction approaches obtained by hybrid neural networks reported in the recent literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6331030/06320656.pdf","startPage":"1805","endPage":"1815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2216546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2216546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Innovative Second-Generation Wavelets Construction With Recurrent Neural Networks for Solar Radiation Forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solar radiation","Wavelet transforms","Neurons","Vectors","Forecasting","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","mean square error methods","photovoltaic power systems","power engineering computing","recurrent neural nets","solar power stations","sunlight","time series","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-generation wavelets construction","wavelet recurrent neural networks","solar radiation forecasting","solar radiation prediction","power estimation","photovoltaic modules","observed meteorological data","WRNN","timescale-related variations","wind speed variation","humidity variation","temperature variation","meteorological time series","University of Catania","Italy","inverse wavelet transform","root-mean-square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Methodological time series","photovoltaic (PV) module","prediction","recurrent neural networks (RNNs)","second-generation wavelets","solar radiation","wavelet theory"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Forecasting","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Solar Energy","Wavelet Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Innovative Second-Generation Wavelets Construction With Recurrent Neural Networks for Solar Radiation Forecasting","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6320656/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13057110","pubMedId":"24808074","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Innovative Second-Generation Wavelets Construction With Recurrent Neural Networks for Solar Radiation Forecasting","sourcePdf":"tnnls-capizzi-2216546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087118S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6331030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6331030","articleId":"6320656","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6320658,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Wang","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6331030/6320658/6320658-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lili Wang received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2010.","She is currently with the Department of Applied Mathematics, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai.

The bottlenecks of these topologies are, however, the need for isolated supplies for the cells and the lack of modularity. This paper focuses on the design and control of high-resolution, high-efficiency multilevel inverters with simplified dc power supplies. It introduces several rules for systematically designing the dc voltages of the cells, for which all unsupplied capacitor voltages can be regulated. Six classes of inverters are obtained covering single- and three-phase, staircase and pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) inverters. New configurations of hybrid cascade multilevel inverters are obtained for each class. A double modulation strategy with two different frequencies is proposed that allows switching losses of PWM inverters to be reduced. Decoupled mechanisms are proposed for the total and internal energy balances. It is shown how to make the design robust by taking into account conversion losses and large dc-voltage imbalances in the design and control. An analysis of the maximum voltage utilization and efficiency of the resulting configurations is carried out. The effectiveness of the novel concepts is validated experimentally for two of the proposed topologies.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2222446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2222446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06320661.pdf","startPage":"3100","endPage":"3113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Design of High-Performance Hybrid Cascaded Multilevel Inverters With Active Voltage Balance and Minimum Switching Losses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Design of High-Performance Hybrid Cascaded Multilevel Inverters With Active Voltage Balance and Minimum Switching Losses","volume":"28","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191062","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320661/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Design of High-Performance Hybrid Cascaded Multilevel Inverters With Active Voltage Balance and Minimum Switching Losses","sourcePdf":"tpel-mariethoz-2222446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06023S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6320661","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6320665,"authors":[{"name":"Ulugbek S.

We characterize the maximum-a-posteriori probability (MAP) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators for such signals. Interestingly, some of the MAP estimators for the L\u00e9vy model coincide with popular signal-denoising algorithms (e.g., total-variation (TV) regularization). We propose a novel non-iterative implementation of the MMSE estimator based on the belief-propagation (BP) algorithm performed in the Fourier domain. Our algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the joint statistics of general L\u00e9vy processes are much easier to describe by their characteristic function, as the probability densities do not always admit closed-form expressions. We then use our new estimator as a benchmark to compare the performance of existing algorithms for the optimal recovery of gradient-sparse signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320665/","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6320665/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"MMSE Estimation of Sparse L\u00e9vy Processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE Estimation of Sparse L\u00e9vy Processes","sourcePdf":"tsp-kamilov-2222394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103202S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6373759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6373759","articleId":"6320665","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6320666,"authors":[{"name":"Evgeny Kupershtein","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6373759/6320666/6320666-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Evgeny Kupershtein received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2007.

It is also demonstrated that error correction with the estimated mean and variance values yields much better performance when compared to the method that only updates the mean.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222399","startPage":"440","endPage":"449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6387660/06320667.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of NAND Flash Memory Threshold Voltage Distribution for Optimum Soft-Decision Error Correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of NAND Flash Memory Threshold Voltage Distribution for Optimum Soft-Decision Error Correction","volume":"61","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188265","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6320667/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of NAND Flash Memory Threshold Voltage Distribution for Optimum Soft-Decision Error Correction","sourcePdf":"tsp-lee-2222399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090509S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6387660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6387660","articleId":"6320667","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6320668,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"A.

In a departure from existing work, the wiretapper possesses a novel capability to act either as a passive eavesdropper or as an active jammer, under a half-duplex constraint. The transmitter therefore faces a choice between allocating all of its power for data, or broadcasting artificial interference along with the information signal in an attempt to jam the eavesdropper (assuming its instantaneous channel state is unknown). To examine the resulting trade-offs for the legitimate transmitter and the adversary, we model their interactions as a two-person zero-sum game with the ergodic MIMO secrecy rate as the payoff function. We first examine conditions for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria (NE) and the structure of mixed-strategy NE for the strategic form of the game. We then derive equilibrium strategies for the extensive form of the game where players move sequentially under scenarios of perfect and imperfect information. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to examine the equilibrium outcomes of the various scenarios considered.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6373759/06320668.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"91","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jamming Games in the MIMO Wiretap Channel With an Active Eavesdropper","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Jamming Games in the MIMO Wiretap Channel With an Active Eavesdropper","volume":"61","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13167659","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320668/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming Games in the MIMO Wiretap Channel With an Active Eavesdropper","sourcePdf":"tsp-mukherjee-2222386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121836S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","isNumber":"6373759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"118","articleId":"6320668","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6320669,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyu Zhang","affiliation":["Personal Communication Network and Spread Spectrum (PCN&SS) Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6373759/6320669/6320669-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhengyu Zhang was born in 1985.

To fully utilize the time diversity provided by automatic repeat request (ARQ), progressive linear precoders are designed with the objective of maximizing the mutual information delivered by multiple transmissions of the same packet. Firstly, the relay-only precoder is considered when the channel state information (CSI) is only available at the relay and the destination. We derive the form of the optimal ARQ precoder by restating the optimization problem as a matrix diagonalization problem, then the power allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem where the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are used to obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic performance when the two hops' signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity or zero respectively. Secondly, the joint source and relay precoder is studied assuming the CSI known at all nodes. The ARQ precoder is derived by matrix diagonalization and channel pairing between previous subchannels and current subchannels. Then the power allocation at the source and relay is formulated as a nonconvex multi-variable optimization problem where we employ an iterative algorithm to obtain the suboptimal solution. Moreover, the asymptotic performance is also analyzed with the two hops' SNR being extremely large or small, based on which the simplified method of searching channel pairing matrix is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed precoders can improve the system performance significantly, especially in the joint source and relay precoder scenario.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive Linear Precoder Optimization for ARQ Packet Retransmissions in Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222385","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6373759/06320669.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Progressive Linear Precoder Optimization for ARQ Packet Retransmissions in Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6320669/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13167660","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive Linear Precoder Optimization for ARQ Packet Retransmissions in Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-qiu-2222385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098486S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6373759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6373759","articleId":"6320669","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6320670,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Chen","affiliation":["Institut Charles Delaunay, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Troyes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6387660/6320670/6320670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Chen (S'12) was born in Xi'an, China, in 1984.

We observe that the target and interference spectra are inherently sparse in the spatio-temporal domain. Hence, we exploit that sparsity to develop an efficient STAP technique that utilizes considerably lesser number of secondary data and produces an equivalent performance as the other existing STAP techniques. In addition, the use of an OFDM signal increases the frequency diversity of our system, as different scattering centers of a target resonate at different frequencies, and thus improves the target detectability. First, we formulate a realistic sparse-measurement model for an OFDM radar considering both the clutter and jammer as the interfering sources. Then, we apply a residual sparse-recovery technique based on the LASSO estimator to estimate the target and interference covariance matrices, and subsequently compute the optimal STAP-filter weights. Our numerical results demonstrate a comparative performance analysis of the proposed sparse-STAP algorithm with four other existing STAP methods. Furthermore, we discover that the OFDM-STAP filter-weights are adaptable to the frequency-variabilities of the target and interference responses, in addition to the spatio-temporal variabilities. Hence, by better utilizing the frequency variabilities, we propose an adaptive OFDM-waveform design technique, and consequently gain a significant amount of STAP-performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6373759/06320672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373759","startPage":"118","endPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Radar Space-Time Adaptive Processing by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Sparsity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Radar Space-Time Adaptive Processing by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Sparsity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13167666","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6320672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Radar Space-Time Adaptive Processing by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Sparsity","sourcePdf":"tsp-sen-2222387-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081258S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6373759","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6373759","articleId":"6320672","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6320673,"authors":[{"name":"Ha Hoang Kha","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6387660/6320673/6320673-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ha Hoang Kha (S'05\u2013M'09) was born in Dong Thap, Vietnam.

The problem of interest is to find the beamforming weights across relays to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among source users subject to individual power constraints at each relay. Such a beamforming design is shown to be a hard nonconvex optimization problem and therefore it is mathematically challenging to find the optimal solution. By exploring its partial convex structures, we recast the design problem as minimization of a d.c. (difference of two convex) objective function subject to convex constraints and develop an effective iterative algorithm of low complexity to solve it. Simulation results show that our optimal cooperative beamforming scheme realizes the inherent diversity order of the relay network and it performs significantly better than the equal-power beamforming weights.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6387660/06320673.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"467","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Cooperative Beamforming for SC-FDMA Multi-User Multi-Relay Networks by Tractable D.C.

Upon receiving a bit from a sensor, the FC updates the global LLR and performs a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) step. We derive the fusion rules under various types of channels. We further provide an asymptotic analysis on the average decision delay for the proposed channel-aware scheme, and show that the asymptotic decision delay is characterized by a Kullback-Leibler information number. The delay analysis facilitates the choice of the appropriate signaling schemes under different channel types for sending the 1-bit information from the sensors to the FC.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Noise measurement","Sensor fusion","Wireless sensor networks","Educational institutions","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","distributed sensors","probability","sampling methods","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel-aware decentralized detection","level-triggered sampling","distributed sensors","fusion center","noisy channels","log-likelihood ratio","sequential probability ratio test","asymptotic decision delay","Kullback-Leibler information number"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic analysis","channel-aware fusion","decentralized detection","KL information","level-triggered sampling","sequential analysis","SPRT"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6387660/06320675.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-Aware Decentralized Detection via Level-Triggered Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel-Aware Decentralized Detection via Level-Triggered Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320675/","volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320675/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13188248","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-Aware Decentralized Detection via Level-Triggered Sampling","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2222401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103442S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6387660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6387660","articleId":"6320675","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6320676,"authors":[{"name":"Zai Yang","affiliation":["EXQUISITUS, Centre for E-City, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37716167700"},{"name":"Lihua Xie","affiliation":["EXQUISITUS, Centre for E-City, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139300"},{"name":"Cishen Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Cishen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274220300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6320676","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":393,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6008},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Estimation","Bayesian methods","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","iterative methods","mean square error methods","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-grid direction of arrival estimation","sparse Bayesian inference","DOA estimation","signal processing","sparse signal reconstruction","off-grid DOA estimation problem","iterative algorithm","Bayesian perspective","Laplace prior","multisnapshot cases","mean squared estimation error","coarse sampling grid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","direction of arrival estimation","off-grid model","sparse Bayesian inference","sparse signal reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is a classical problem in signal processing with many practical applications. Its research has recently been advanced owing to the development of methods based on sparse signal reconstruction. While these methods have shown advantages over conventional ones, there are still difficulties in practical situations where true DOAs are not on the discretized sampling grid. To deal with such an off-grid DOA estimation problem, this paper studies an off-grid model that takes into account effects of the off-grid DOAs and has a smaller modeling error. An iterative algorithm is developed based on the off-grid model from a Bayesian perspective while joint sparsity among different snapshots is exploited by assuming a Laplace prior for signals at all snapshots. The new approach applies to both single snapshot and multi-snapshot cases. Numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm has improved accuracy in terms of mean squared estimation error. The algorithm can maintain high estimation accuracy even under a very coarse sampling grid.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6373759/06320676.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-Grid Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Sparse Bayesian Inference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Off-Grid Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Sparse Bayesian Inference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320676/","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13167656","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320676/","volume":"61","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-Grid Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Sparse Bayesian Inference","sourcePdf":"tsp-xie-2222378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091014S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6373759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"393","xplore-issue":"6373759","articleId":"6320676","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6320679,"authors":[{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","id":"38184476700"},{"name":"Daiming Qu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Daiming","lastName":"Qu","id":"37274417000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6320679","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1097},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Joints","Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","decoding","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint decoding","LDPC coding","OFDM system","PTS PAPR reduction","low-density parity-check code","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","peak-to-average power ratio","partial transmit sequence","PTS processing","concatenated LDPC-PTS code","parity-check matrix","belief propagation algorithm","phase factor recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity check (LDPC)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","partial transmit sequence (PTS)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","Tanner graph"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate a low-density parity-check (LDPC)-coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system with a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction using the partial transmit sequence (PTS), which does not transmit PTS side information about the phase factors.

This paper presents a systematic comparison between these two technologies, depicting the main advantages and drawbacks of each one. Key programming and implementation aspects are addressed in order to give an overall idea of their most important features and allow the comparison between DSP and FPGA devices. A classical linear control strategy for a well-known voltage-source-converter (VSC)-based topology used as Static Compensator (STATCOM) is considered as a driving example to evaluate the performance of both approaches. A proof-of-concept laboratory prototype is separately controlled with the TMS320F2812 DSP and the Spartan-3 XCS1000 FPGA to illustrate the characteristics of both technologies. In the case of the DSP, a virtual floating-point library is used to accelerate the control routines compared to double precision arithmetic. On the other hand, two approaches are developed for the FPGA implementation, the first one reduces the hardware utilization and the second one reduces the computation time. Even though both boards can successfully control the STATCOM, results show that the FPGA achieves the best computation time thanks to the high degree of parallelism available on the device.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2222419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6582568/06320689.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2222419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA v/s DSP Performance Comparison for a VSC-Based STATCOM Control Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA v/s DSP Performance Comparison for a VSC-Based STATCOM Control Application","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320689/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13706451","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA v/s DSP Performance Comparison for a VSC-Based STATCOM Control Application","sourcePdf":"tii-munoz-2222419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106466S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6582568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6582568","articleId":"6320689","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6320690,"authors":[{"name":"Tole Sutikno","affiliation":["Universitas Ahmad Dahlan, Yogyakarta, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakart, ID"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6320690/6320690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tole Sutikno (M'08) received the B.Eng. degree from Diponegoro University, Indonesia, and the M.Eng. degree from Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia, in 1999 and 2004, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

The DTC performance is significantly improved by the use of FPGA, which can execute the DTC algorithm at higher sampling frequency. This leads to the reduction of the torque ripple and improved flux and torque estimations. The main achievements are: 1) calculating a discrete integration operation of stator flux using backward Euler approach; 2) modifying a so called nonrestoring method in calculating the complicated square root operation in stator flux estimator; 3) introducing a new flux sector determination method; 4) increasing the sampling frequency to 200 kHz such that the digital computation will perform similar to that of the analog operation; and 5) using two's complement fixed-point format approach to minimize calculation errors and the hardware resource usage in all operations. The design was achieved in VHDL, based on a Matlab/Simulink simulation model. The Hardware-in-the-Loop method is used to verify the functionality of the FPGA estimator. The simulation results are validated experimentally. Thus, it is demonstrated that FPGA implementation of DTC drives can achieve excellent performance at high sampling frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13706447","htmlLink":"/document/6320690/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Improved FPGA Implementation of Direct Torque Control for Induction Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved FPGA Implementation of Direct Torque Control for Induction Machines","sourcePdf":"tii-nikidris-2222420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106786S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6582568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6582568","articleId":"6320690","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6320693,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Guang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xuan Guang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from University of Jinan, Jinan, China, in 2005, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2008, and 2012, respectively.

Several bounds in classical coding theory have been extended to NEC, especially the Singleton bound. In this paper, following the research line using the extended global encoding kernels proposed by Zhang in 2008, the refined Singleton bound of NEC can be proved more explicitly. Moreover, we give a constructive proof of the attainability of this bound and indicate that the required field size for the existence of network maximum distance separable (MDS) codes can become smaller further. By this proof, an algorithm is proposed to construct general linear network error correction codes including the linear network error correction MDS codes. Finally, we study the error correction capability of random linear NEC. Motivated partly by the performance analysis of random linear network coding, we evaluate the different failure probabilities defined in this paper in order to analyze the performance of random linear NEC. Several upper bounds on these probabilities are obtained and they show that these probabilities will approach to zero as the size of the base field goes to infinity. Using these upper bounds, we slightly improve on the probability mass function of the minimum distance of random linear network error correction codes in a paper by Balli and colleagues, as well as the upper bound on the field size required for the existence of linear network error correction codes with degradation at most \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234721","htmlLink":"/document/6320693/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Network Error Correction Codes in Packet Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Network Error Correction Codes in Packet Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-guang-2222344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114436S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6413249","articleId":"6320693","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6320694,"authors":[{"name":"Iddo Naiss","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Iddo Naiss received his B.Sc.

This lemma has found many applications in the study of the stability of control systems, and in the design and optimization of robust transceivers in communications. We then present three different novel applications of this lemma in the area of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) robust transceiver optimization. Specifically, the scenarios of interest are: (i) robust linear beamforming in an interfering adhoc network, (ii) robust design of a general relay network, including the two-way relay channel as a special case, and (iii) a half-duplex one-way relay system with multiple relays. For these networks, we formulate the design problems of minimizing the (sum) MSE of the symbol detection subject to different average power budget constraints. We show that these design problems are non-convex (with bilinear or trilinear constraints) and semi-infinite in multiple independent uncertainty matrix-valued variables. We propose a two-stage solution where in the first step the semi-infinite constraints are converted to linear matrix inequalities using the generalized sign-definiteness lemma, and in the second step, we use an iterative algorithm based on alternating convex search (ACS). Via simulations we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sign-Definiteness Lemma and Its Applications to Robust Transceiver Optimization for Multiuser MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6387660/06320700.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"The Sign-Definiteness Lemma and Its Applications to Robust Transceiver Optimization for Multiuser MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6320700/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13188249","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sign-Definiteness Lemma and Its Applications to Robust Transceiver Optimization for Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-avazkonandehgharavol-2222379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141228S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6387660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6387660","articleId":"6320700","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6320702,"authors":[{"name":"Val\u00e9rian Nemesin","affiliation":["GSM team, Institut Fresnel (CNRS UMR 7249), Aix-Marseilles University, Domaine Universitaire de Saint J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Val\u00e9rian","lastName":"Nemesin","id":"38527849900"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Derrode","affiliation":["GSM team, Institut Fresnel (CNRS UMR 7249), Aix-Marseilles University, Domaine Universitaire de Saint J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Derrode","id":"37274750300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6320702","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":769},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The Pairwise Kalman Filter (PKF) [W.

The filter banks of FBMC are derived from a prototype filter that determines the system performance, such as stopband attenuation, intersymbol interference (ISI) and interchannel interference (ICI). In this paper, we formulate a problem of direct optimization of the filter impulse-response coefficients for the FBMC systems to minimize the stopband energy and constrain the ISI/ICI. Unfortunately, this filter optimization problem is nonconvex and highly nonlinear. Nevertheless, observing that all the functions in the optimization problem are twice-differentiable, we propose using the \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\alpha$</tex></formula>\n-based Branch and Bound (\n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\alpha$</tex> </formula>\nBB) algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. However, the convergence time of the algorithm is unacceptable because the number of unknowns (i.e., the filter coefficients) in the optimization problem is too large. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a method to dramatically reduce the number of unknowns of the optimization problem through approximation of the constraints, so that the optimal solution of the approximated optimization problem can be obtained with acceptable computational complexity. Numerical results show that, the proposed approximation is reasonable, and the optimized filters obtained with the proposed method achieve significantly lower stopband energy than those with the frequency sampling and windowing based techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2222397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2222397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6373759/06320706.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prototype Filter Optimization to Minimize Stopband Energy With NPR Constraint for Filter Bank Multicarrier Modulation Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Prototype Filter Optimization to Minimize Stopband Energy With NPR Constraint for Filter Bank Multicarrier Modulation Systems","volume":"61","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prototype Filter Optimization to Minimize Stopband Energy With NPR Constraint for Filter Bank Multicarrier Modulation Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-qu-2222397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081803S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6373759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6373759","articleId":"6320706","onlineDate":"03 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6320708,"authors":[{"name":"Kyuyeon Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6387660/6320708/6320708-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyuyeon Hwang (S'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, South Korea, in 2010.","He is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, and currently serves his internship at IBM Austin Research Laboratory, Texas.

However, parallel implementations of particle filters with state-of-the-art systematic resampling on a GPU suffer from a severe workload imbalance problem, which results in fluctuation of the computation speed and hinders their application to real-time systems. We analyze the computational load imbalance of the systematic resampling method in conventional implementations, and show that the workload imbalance is proportional to the variance of weights in particle filters. Then, we propose a load balanced particle replication (LBPR) algorithm for systematic resampling, which shows almost constant execution speed and outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of the worst-case computation time.

The algorithm, AMP-MMV, is capable of exploiting temporal correlations in the amplitudes of non-zero coefficients, and provides soft estimates of the signal vectors as well as the underlying support. Central to the proposed approach is an extension of recently developed approximate message passing techniques to the amplitude-correlated MMV setting. Aided by these techniques, AMP-MMV offers a computational complexity that is linear in all problem dimensions. In order to allow for automatic parameter tuning, an expectation-maximization algorithm that complements AMP-MMV is described.

A 2T1C gain cell implemented only with regular thin oxide devices consists of an asymmetric 2T cell and a coupling PMOS capacitor. The PMOS capacitor ensures proper operation even without a boosted supply by utilizing a beneficial coupling for read and a preferential boosting for write. A repair scheme based on a single-ended 7T SRAM has features such as a local differential write and shared control with the main 2T1C array. A storage voltage monitor is proposed to track the retention characteristics of a gain cell eDRAM under PVT variations and to adjust its refresh rate adaptively.

Here, we considered that the channel state information is known at the receiver. Under the Rayleigh fading environment and specifications of IEEE802.11g, simulations are made by varying the NBI width in sub carriers (jammer width), signal to noise ratio (SNR) and signal to interference ratio (SIR).

In this paper, the partitioning between ARM and FPGA on performance characteristics is discussed. The ARM devices made a vital role in the conventional embedded applications design. Nowadays the FPGA are mainly used not only for logic design and also the system design with embedded technology or digital signal processing principles. The FPGA's performance measure is taken for conventional counter application which follows the state diagram approach using Verilog HDL and RISC IP core based embedded application design. By comparing RISC CPU based counter logic with FSM based counter logic, the Custom CPU based design produces the faster output response than FSM based design however it occupied large chip area. As a conclusion, custom CPU based logic system design occupies large chip area so this logic cannot be used for area efficient application design. Finally we designed the Mono Alphabetic Encryption/ Decryption Algorithm by partitioning ARM Cortex M3-LM3S608 and Xilinx FPGA XC3S400. The same logic was designed and verified with ARM 7TDMI-LPC 2148 Microcontroller also. The devices are selected based on its feature that is, the Multi Core Multiple Output Parallel LFSR logic was implemented using FPGA and Encryption/Decryption, serial communication logic were implemented in ARM. The results shows the preliminary logic for developing SoC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of partitioning between ARM and FPGA on performance characteristics","doi":"10.1109/ICACCCT.2012.6320745","startPage":"78","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCCT.2012.6320745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320721","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313471/6320721/06320745.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of partitioning between ARM and FPGA on performance characteristics","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320745/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037968","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of partitioning between ARM and FPGA on performance characteristics","confLoc":"Ramanathapuram, India","sourcePdf":"17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076409S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313471","isNumber":"6320721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313471","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6320721","articleId":"6320745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6320747,"authors":[{"name":"T.

First a single level DWT decomposition is done on a host image and the secret information is hidden by manipulating the transform coefficients of the decomposed image. After embedding, the stego image is subjected to various types of image processing attacks such as Gaussian white noise, salt and pepper noise, blurring and sharpening. Experiments show that the peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) generated by the proposed method is better.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313471/6320721/06320747.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCCT.2012.6320747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCCT.2012.6320747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized discrete wavelet transform based steganography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rivers","Rocks","Noise","Cryptography","Payloads","Internet","Graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image restoration","steganography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized discrete wavelet transform","steganography","secret message","steganalysis","optimal discrete wavelet transform","single level DWT decomposition","secret information","transform coefficient","stego image","image processing","Gaussian white noise","salt and pepper noise","blurring","sharpening","peak signal noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Transform","Peak signal noise ratio","Steganalysis","Steganography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimized discrete wavelet transform based steganography","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320747/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13037970","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized discrete wavelet transform based steganography","confLoc":"Ramanathapuram, India","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073386S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313471","isNumber":"6320721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313471","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6320721","articleId":"6320747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6320751,"authors":[{"name":"N Balasubramanian","affiliation":["Dept. of MCA, Mohamed Sathak Engg.

To recognize various relationships those exist between question and answer pair, measuring semantically is essential. We present study using a match maker algorithm for similarity measurement between question-answer pair. The study compares similarity measurement using match maker algorithm as against semantic similarity measure on Miller-Charles bench marked data set.

Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) has been known as a technique to enhance the transmission quality and capacity. OFDM can be obtained with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) configuration to increase the diversity gain and to enhance the system capacity. One of the major drawbacks in OFDM communication is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The subcarrier waveform shaping in OFDM is a form of precoding scheme, where each OFDM block is linearly transformed by shaping matrix before modulation and transmission. This approach has the potential of reducing the PAPR of the OFDM without affecting the bandwidth efficiency of the system and the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. The PAPR reductions of MIMO-OFDM systems are obtained using the precoding scheme. The simulations show that the precoding scheme performs better with MIMO-OFDM systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction in MIMO-OFDM systems using joint channel estimation and Precoding","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCCT.2012.6320796","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313471/6320721/06320796.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCCT.2012.6320796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction in MIMO-OFDM systems using joint channel estimation and Precoding","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320796/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038018","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction in MIMO-OFDM systems using joint channel estimation and Precoding","confLoc":"Ramanathapuram, India","sourcePdf":"68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073902S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313471","isNumber":"6320721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313471","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6320721","articleId":"6320796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6320803,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The new algorithm is implemented to the non-convex economic load dispatch (ELD) problem so as to minimize the total generation cost when considering the linear and non linear constraints. In EHSA algorithm, the velocity of the particle in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is improved by the mutation operator of Differential Evolution (DE) thus a global solution is obtained. This solution is set as an initial solution to Simulated Annealing (SA) to reach an optimal solution. The proposed methodology is implemented for economic dispatch problem by considering the constraints such as generator constraints, transmission loss, ramp rate limits and prohibited operating zones. This method is experimented on a 3 units test system to get an optimized result. By using this optimization algorithm we obtain a minimum operating cost with minimum transmission loss and better convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320803/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13038025","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320803/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solving non-convex economic load dispatch problem by Efficient Hybrid Simulated Annealing algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving non-convex economic load dispatch problem by Efficient Hybrid Simulated Annealing algorithm","confLoc":"Ramanathapuram, India","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063605S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313471","isNumber":"6320721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313471","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6320721","articleId":"6320803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6320804,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.S.

After the preprocessing steps, an EEMD based method is applied on the luminance channel of the resulting image to further correct the brightness of the image.

Most approaches for soft error mitigation use Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) to avoid the consequences of these errors. The drawback is that TMR implementation results in a triplication of required hardware and therefore TMR increases the power consumption. This paper describes a novel approach of soft error mitigation technique for SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays without using the Triple Modular Redundancy approach. Based on additional logic storing the correct states, it is capable of detecting Single Event Upsets (SEUs), reconfiguring the system and to correct the detected errors via rollback to the last known correct state. The approach was implemented as a prototype and this paper describes the first results of our research and shows that it is possible to mitigate soft errors in a efficient way but not with the same safety level TMR does.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel soft error mitigation approach for SRAM-based FPGAs","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320876","publicationTitle":"World Automation Congress 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"World Automation Congress 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6311121/6320876/06320922.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel soft error mitigation approach for SRAM-based FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320922/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel soft error mitigation approach for SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1569524071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056307S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6311121","isNumber":"6320876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6311121","xplore-issue":"6320876","articleId":"6320922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TSI Press","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6320929,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Zhenyi Liu","id":"37087602209"},{"name":"Qing Hui","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Qing Hui","id":"37087352770"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-889334-47-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4497-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-889335-47-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-4824"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-4824"}],"articleNumber":"6320929","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Benchmark testing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6320929","abstract":"In this paper, a new method to deal with equality or inequality constraints in constrained optimization is proposed. We use the new method with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the well-known 24 benchmark constrained optimization problems in the literature. The PSO algorithm is well known for its fast convergence to the possible optimal position. However, in constrained optimization, the performance of PSO is not as good as it is in unconstrained optimization, partly because PSO is not good at finding the feasible region. Due to the motivation by this weakness of PSO, we develop a method called Numerical Gradient (NG) to find the feasible region. By means of the information that NG can provide, we utilize the PSO algorithm to find the optimal position of the problem. We call this new PSO variant Numerical Gradient Particle Swarm Optimization (NGPSO). A detailed description of the mechanism for NGPSO is provided and some numerical results are presented compared with the results from the existing PSO variants dealing with constraint optimization problems.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"World Automation Congress 2012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6320876","displayPublicationTitle":"World Automation Congress 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6311121/6320876/06320929.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constraint-handling technique for Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6320929/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A constraint-handling technique for Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6320929/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constraint-handling technique for Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","sourcePdf":"1569524099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058246S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6311121","isNumber":"6320876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6311121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6320876","articleId":"6320929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TSI Press","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6320935,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Since the number of nursing-care experts who can evaluate the nursing-care texts is a few, it is hard to do the above mentioned evaluation process for a large number of nurses. To assist nursing-care experts in evaluating the nursing-care texts, a computer aided nursing-care text classification system has been developed.

Used for many years for the manipulation of particles from cell-scale to macromolecules, we present here the application of the technique for manipulation of DNA containing only adenine-thymine (poly AT) bases, and that of DNA containing only cytosine-guanine (poly GC), using microfabricated electrode structures. Poly AT was stained with DAPI and JOJO-1 for poly GC DNA. It was found that there were differences between the frequency-dependent DEP behavior of the two molecules; when looking at the difference between the two types on crossover frequency (the point where DEP changes from attractive to repulsive), it was found that they varied by up to a factor of 2. This points to possible insigns in the charge conduction mechanism in different DNA forms, as well as potential new mechanisms for gene separations and sequencing.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2012.6321928","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310163/6321885/06321928.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","publicationTitle":"2012 12th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2012.6321928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6321885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectrophoresis of poly AT and poly GC DNA Nanomanipulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6321928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dielectrophoresis of poly AT and poly GC DNA Nanomanipulation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13045951","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6321928/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectrophoresis of poly AT and poly GC DNA Nanomanipulation","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"7575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05658S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310163","isNumber":"6321885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310163","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6321885","articleId":"6321928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6321958,"authors":[{"name":"Jayasimha Atulasimha","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jayasimha","lastName":"Atulasimha","id":"37586590600"},{"name":"Supriyo Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Supriyo","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37287104400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2200-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2198-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2199-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"},{"format":"CD","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"6321958","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic domains","Magnetostriction","Magnetic resonance imaging","Magnetostrictive devices","Nanoscale devices","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","logic gates","magnetic logic","magnetic storage","magnetisation","magnetoelectronics","magnetostrictive devices","multiferroics","nanoelectronics","nanofabrication","nanomagnetics","piezoelectric devices","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["super energy efficient computing scheme","interacting multiferroic nanomagnets","piezoelectric layer","magnetostrictive layer","clock rates","memory elements","binary logic gates","associative memory","four state logic","signal processing functions","stress induced nanoscale magnetization dynamics","ultralow energy hybrid spintronic-straintronics memory","information processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["straintronics","spintronics","multiferroic","nanomagnetic logic (NML)"]}],"abstract":"We have theoretically shown that multiferroic nanomagnets (consisting of a piezoelectric and a magnetostrictive layer) could be used to perform computing while dissipating ~ few 100 kT/bit at clock rates of ~1GHz [1,2,3].

This microscope provides a real-time high resolution image under water-contained condition. We have been applied this system for nanobiomanipulation, nano-bioevaluation, and single cell-analysis/manipulation using various types of nanotools.

Normally AFM tip is controlled to scan on sample surface line by line to get the topographic image and this process takes several minutes. Higher sample rate is demanded so that when doing continuous imaging, the time interval between each image can be significantly shorted thus video-imaging can be achieved. In this paper, a compressive sensing based AFM video-imaging system is built, and random walk based scanning path is proposed. Compressive sensing requires random sampling. Bio-inspired random walk based scan path is able to provide a random tip moving path, which enables compressive sensing to be implemented into AFM scanning system. Experiments based on this system are set up in order to test the performance. It first raster scan the entire area and then generate a biased random tip moving path focusing on some specific areas. Compressive scan is then used to continuously scan the sample surface. Finally, video-imaging is achieved and dynamic changes in nano-scale are observed.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2012.6322148","publicationTitle":"2012 12th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310163/6321885/06322148.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2012.6322148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6321885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired scanning for video-imaging using an atomic force microscope","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322148/","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired scanning for video-imaging using an atomic force microscope","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13056276","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322148/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired scanning for video-imaging using an atomic force microscope","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"8637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070875S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310163","isNumber":"6321885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310163","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6321885","articleId":"6322148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6322168,"authors":[{"name":"Jayita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jayita","lastName":"Das","id":"37890553400"},{"name":"Syed M.

The optimization of energy consumption in the cloud computing environment is the question how to use various energy conservation strategies to efficiently allocate resources.

Compressed sensing (CS) is a new technique that promises to directly produce a compressed version of a signal by projecting it to a lower dimensional but information preserving domain before the sampling process. Designing hardware to accomplish this projection, however, has remained problematic and while some hardware architectures do exist, they are either limited in signal model or scale poorly for low power implementations. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate CapMux, a scalable hardware architecture for a compressed sensing analog front end. CapMux is low power and can handle arbitrary sparse and compressible signals, i.e. it is universal. The key idea behind CapMux's scalability is time multiplexed access to a single shared signal processing chain that projects the signal onto a set of pseudo-random sparse binary basis functions. We demonstrate the performance of a proof-of-concept 16-channel CapMux implementation for signals sparse in the time, frequency and wavelet domains. This circuit consumes 20\u03bcA on average while providing over 30dB SNR recovery in most instances.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6311539/6322244/06322255.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CapMux: A scalable analog front end for low power compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Sensors","Sparse matrices","Capacitors","Hardware","Switches","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","sampling methods","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog front end scalability","low power compressed sensing","real-world signals","Nyquist rate","CS","information preserving domain","sampling process","hardware architectures","arbitrary sparse signals","single shared signal processing chain","time multiplexed access","pseudorandom sparse binary basis functions","proof-of-concept 16-channel CapMux implementation","frequency domains","wavelet domains","time domains","current 20 muA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Time Multiplexed Active Circuits","Low Power Sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"CapMux: A scalable analog front end for low power compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322255/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13038520","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CapMux: A scalable analog front end for low power compressed sensing","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IEEECha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114947S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6311539","isNumber":"6322244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6311539","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6322244","articleId":"6322255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6322266,"authors":[{"name":"Minghong Lin","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Minghong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37714571000"},{"name":"Zhenhua Liu","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Liu","id":"38466302800"},{"name":"Adam Wierman","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Wierman","id":"37318368400"},{"name":"Lachlan L.

Lightly loaded data centers can then turn off surplus servers. This paper studies online algorithms for determining the number of servers to leave on in each data center, and then uses these algorithms to study the environmental potential of geographical load balancing (GLB). A commonly suggested algorithm for this setting is \u201creceding horizon control\u201d (RHC), which computes the provisioning for the current time by optimizing over a window of predicted future loads. We show that RHC performs well in a homogeneous setting, in which all servers can serve all jobs equally well; however, we also prove that differences in propagation delays, servers, and electricity prices can cause RHC perform badly, So, we introduce variants of RHC that are guaranteed to perform as well in the face of such heterogeneity. These algorithms are then used to study the feasibility of powering a continent-wide set of data centers mostly by renewable sources, and to understand what portfolio of renewable energy is most effective.","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322266","publicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6311539/6322244/06322266.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322244","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online algorithms for geographical load balancing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online algorithms for geographical load balancing","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322266/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13038531","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6322266/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online algorithms for geographical load balancing","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IEEELin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098148S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6311539","isNumber":"6322244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6311539","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"6322244","articleId":"6322266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6322270,"authors":[{"name":"Yuwen Sun","affiliation":["Network and Embedded System Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA"],"lastName":"Yuwen Sun","id":"38490305700"},{"name":"Lucas Wanner","affiliation":["Network and Embedded System Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Wanner","id":"37706088800"},{"name":"Mani Srivastava","affiliation":["Network and Embedded System Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Mani","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37272238500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2154-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2155-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2153-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6322270","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-cost estimation of sub-system power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322270","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Radiation detectors","Random access memory","Adaptation models","Power measurement","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","operating systems (computers)","performance evaluation","power aware computing","power measurement","random-access storage","real-time systems","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost subsystem power estimation","real-time fine-grained power consumption information","energy optimization","operating systems","energy adaptation","DiPART","disaggregated power analysis in real time","subsystem power consumption estimation","performance counters","event counters","system-wide power sensor","Intel Atom-based node cluster","CPU","RAM","disk power measurements","subsystem power measurements","estimation error reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear model","adaptive model","power estimation","performance (event) counter","subsystem power disaggregation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322270","publicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6311539/6322244/06322270.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322244","abstract":"Real-time, fine-grained power consumption information enables energy optimization and adaptation for operating systems and applications. Due to the high cost associated with dedicated power sensors, however, most computers do not have the ability to measure disaggregated power consumption at a component or subsystem level. We present DiPART (Disaggregated Power Analysis in Real Time), a tool to estimate subsystem power consumption based on performance (event) counters and a single, system-wide power sensor. With only one power sensor for overall system power consumption, DiPART is able to self-adapt to variations in subsystem power consumption present across nominally identical hardware. We validate the approach using a cluster of Intel Atom-based nodes that has been instrumented for subsystem (CPU, RAM and disk) power measurements. DiPART was tested across nodes in the cluster using varied benchmarks, resulting in a 40% reduction in estimation error when compared to a static model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322270/","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13038535","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low-cost estimation of sub-system power","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-cost estimation of sub-system power","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IEEESun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107156S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6311539","isNumber":"6322244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6311539","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6322244","articleId":"6322270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6322275,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelsalam A.

However, the multi-hop data transmission using wireline interconnects result in high energy dissipation and latency. Photonic interconnects have emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional metal/dielectric based on-chip wireline interconnects. Several novel architectures have been proposed using photonic waveguides as interconnects, which are capable of reducing the energy dissipation in data transfer significantly. However, the issues of reliability arising due to waveguide losses and adjacent channel crosstalk in photonic waveguides have not received much attention till date. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a photonic NoC architecture designed by segmenting the waveguides into smaller parts to limit the waveguide losses. This multi-segmented bus based photonic NoC (MSB-PNoC) architecture has been shown to provide higher levels of reliability than state-of-the-art photonic NoCs. Through detailed system level simulations in this work we demonstrate that the MSB-PNoC has a better performance and lower energy dissipation compared to the conventional mesh NoC while also providing better reliability in data transfer than other photonic NoCs.","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322277","publicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Green Computing Conference (IGCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6311539/6322244/06322277.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of reliability aware photonic Network-on-Chip architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322277/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of reliability aware photonic Network-on-Chip architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13038542","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322277/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of reliability aware photonic Network-on-Chip architectures","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"LGDMAKal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051012S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6311539","isNumber":"6322244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6311539","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6322244","articleId":"6322277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6322314,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Kan","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Kan","id":"37889551900"},{"name":"Shen Jihong","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Jihong","id":"37722117000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1450-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4792-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6322314","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Banach spaces","iterative methods","mathematical analysis","particle swarm optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence basis","particle swarm optimization","mathematical description","PSO","normed space","iterative relations","contraction mapping","Banach space","stochastic process","probability process","parameter condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Banach space","contraction mapping principle","stability","convergence","parameter selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322314","abstract":"The general mathematical description of the Particle Swarm Optimization is given in this paper.

accessing scheme of twiddle factors based on Multi-bank memory architecture. It makes the three twiddle factors needed by a mixed-radix 4/2 butterfly operation can be accessed simultaneously. It also makes it possible to design a variable-size FFT processor with only one three-bank twiddle factor lookup table which is advantageous over those other existing algorithms that need double of it. The algorithm proposed can be implemented with only one shift register and an accumulator. In addition, the access number of one of the three banks and its size are reduced by half. Therefore, its implementation is low complexity and area saving.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Algorithm for Twiddle Factor of Variable-size FFT Processor and its Implementation","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Industrial Control and Electronics Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICICEE.2012.285","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Industrial Control and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320836/6322296/06322574.pdf","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICEE.2012.285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Algorithm for Twiddle Factor of Variable-size FFT Processor and its Implementation","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322574/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13057506","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Algorithm for Twiddle Factor of Variable-size FFT Processor and its Implementation","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4792b078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064494S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320836","isNumber":"6322296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320836","xplore-issue":"6322296","articleId":"6322574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6322581,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ying","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ying","id":"37535692200"},{"name":"Li Jianping","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jianping","id":"37411241000"},{"name":"Cai Chaoshi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cai","lastName":"Chaoshi","id":"37541945000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1450-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4792-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6322581","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322581","abstract":"Bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) is a better scheme than BICM through applying iterative decoding algorithm at the receiver. It can get excellent performances both in AWGN and in Rayleigh fading channels. However, the iterative algorithm increases the complexity of the receiver and leads to much decoding delay. Thus, the stopping criterion, which can timely terminate the unnecessary decoding iterations, is put forward. In this paper, based on the cross-entropy (CE) concept, we propose a new method named LLR (log-likelihood-ratio) stopping criterion. Simulation results show that without any exponential computation, the proposed LLR scheme can take a better trade off between the average iteration numbers and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance degradation. Although with a little more iterative numbers than CE at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) sections, it obtains excellent BER performance as compensation. More importantly, besides the less iteration numbers, the LLR scheme performs even better than the fixed scheme at high SNR sections in terms of BER performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding","Modulation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","modulation coding","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stopping criterion","BICM-ID system","bit-interleaved coded modulation","iterative decoding algorithm","Rayleigh fading channels","AWGN channels","decoding delay","receiver","cross-entropy concept","CE concept","log-likelihood-ratio stopping criterion","LLR stopping criterion","bit-error-rate performance degradation","BER performance degradation","high signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID)","soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder","demapper","stopping criterion","log-likelihood-ratio (LLR)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICEE.2012.292","startPage":"1102","endPage":"1105","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Industrial Control and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Industrial Control and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320836/6322296/06322581.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICICEE.2012.292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Stopping Criterion for BICM-ID System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Stopping Criterion for BICM-ID System","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13057513","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6322581/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Stopping Criterion for BICM-ID System","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4792b102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036753S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320836","isNumber":"6322296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320836","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6322296","articleId":"6322581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6322603,"authors":[{"name":"Lijuan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Zhejiang A and F University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406789900"},{"name":"Xiaomei Yi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Zhejiang A and F University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomei","lastName":"Yi","id":"37596610000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1450-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4792-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6322603","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322603","abstract":"In this study, diagnosis was performed with an evolutionary artificial neural network approach based on adaptive genetic algorithm with strong macro-search capability and global optimization, which was used to optimize initial weights and thresholds of the network.

While a remarkably simple scheme (such as those presented in [1] [2]) capable of attaining a significant fraction of the open-loop Shannon capacity of the (4, 1) channel, no such schemes are known for the case of no less than two receive antennas. Following the (4, 1) approach, a new strategy in this letter involving linear receiver processing is designed to receive diversity-multiplexing. Our proposed design procedure can be easily extended to the multi-output system and a code, which outperforms the MISO (4, 1) code while keeping a reasonably low complexity at the receiver. Finally, the numerical results show the proficiency of our design procedure, demonstrating that significant improvements in both capacity and BER are achievable.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012

Both spatial and spectral information have been used to locate and detect the anomaly under the condition of no prior knowledge about the anomaly and the background. Firstly, the hyper-spectral images was decomposed into a series of different scale sub-bands using NSPD; and then using the correlation of neighborhood coefficient of different scale space in a wave-band, the background data was optimally predicted by reducing the anomalous data using the improved kernel unsharp masking filter in different scale of each sub-band. Finally the anomaly targets could be detected by using the RX operator in the feature space. Numerical experiments were conducted on real and synthesized hyperspectral data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with the classical RX algorithm, several experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better detection performance and lower false alarm probability.","doi":"10.1109/ICICEE.2012.350","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Industrial Control and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Industrial Control and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320836/6322296/06322639.pdf","startPage":"1320","endPage":"1323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICEE.2012.350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Nonsubsampled Pyramid Decomposition and Kernel Unsharp Masking for Hyperspectral Image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322639/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Nonsubsampled Pyramid Decomposition and Kernel Unsharp Masking for Hyperspectral Image","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13057570","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322639/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Nonsubsampled Pyramid Decomposition and Kernel Unsharp Masking for Hyperspectral Image","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4792b320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061558S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320836","isNumber":"6322296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320836","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6322296","articleId":"6322639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6322685,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Yu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering Communication, University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Yu","id":"38489560000"},{"name":"Li Jianping","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering Communication, University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jianping","id":"37411241000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1450-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4792-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6322685","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"Iterative decoding algorithm is an valid method to ameliorate the performance of system receiver.

This paper addresses this issue and proposes a novel adaptation control design approach for FPGA-based reconfigurable systems aiming to increase design productivity. This approach combines control distribution and high-level modeling in order to decrease design complexity and enhance design reuse and scalability. Control distribution is based on allocating local control aspects (monitoring, decision and reconfiguration) to distributed controllers, while respecting global system constraints/objectives using a coordinator. High-level modeling makes use of Model-Driven Engineering and the MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems) standard in order to move from high level models to automatic code generation, which significantly simplifies the control design. The proposed design approach is integrated in a model-driven RSoC design flow and allows to model adaptation aspects at different design levels: application, architecture, allocation and deployment, which allows to target a wide range of control requirements. In order to validate our approach, a video processing application was implemented on a reconfigurable system that contained four distributed hardware controllers.","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322871","publicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313484/6322865/06322871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322865","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed control for reconfigurable FPGA systems: A high-level design approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed control for reconfigurable FPGA systems: A high-level design approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322871/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038054","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6322871/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed control for reconfigurable FPGA systems: A high-level design approach","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064804S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313484","isNumber":"6322865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6322865","articleId":"6322871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6322876,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic Hillenbrand","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"Hillenbrand","id":"38131634100"},{"name":"Christian Brugger","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Brugger","id":"38468549600"},{"name":"Jie Tao","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tao","id":"37532647200"},{"name":"Shufan Yang","affiliation":["Intelligent System Research Centre, University of Ulster, Londonderry, UK"],"firstName":"Shufan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38468760900"},{"name":"Matthias Balzer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Balzer","id":"37721043600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2572-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2570-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2571-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6322876","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Program processors","Convolution","Clocks","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","cloud computing","data flow computing","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","logic design","memory architecture","parallel architectures","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-time configurable fabric","programmable fabric","parallel stream processing","RIVER memory architecture","nontrivial data flows","data processing","dynamic streaming engines","DSE","HDL design flow","design optimization","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"The RIVER architecture is a run-time configurable and programmable fabric for parallel stream processing on FPGAs.

Furthermore, our design flow shields users from traditional HDL design flows and tedious design optimizations.

Additionally, the introduction of partial reconfiguration in these systems has increased both their flexibility and performance. This feature allows the designer to switch the context of a specific circuit region without any interruption in the other components, but it has also increased the level of expertise needed for their design. In this paper we introduce a Run Time Manager (RTM) able to map multiple applications on the underlying architecture and execute them concurrently. In order to ensure the RTM portability on different designs, it has been structured so that it is independent from the architecture description. It is illustrated how (1) this RTM can be automatically generated starting from the source code of the input applications, (2) its modular implementation combined with the use of partial reconfiguration allows the user to explore different policies. Finally several tests have been performed to analyse the overhead introduced by such implementation and to demonstrate that the proposed RTM can be effectively used in real case studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038066","htmlLink":"/document/6322883/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic run-time manager generation for reconfigurable MPSoC architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic run-time manager generation for reconfigurable MPSoC architectures","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073135S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313484","isNumber":"6322865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313484","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6322865","articleId":"6322883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6322887,"authors":[{"name":"Miao He","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"He","id":"38490483000"},{"name":"Yanzhe Cui","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Yanzhe","lastName":"Cui","id":"38490474800"},{"name":"Mohammad H.

By combining local Crossbar and its companion peripheral interconnection bus, the Morphing Bus, compact embedded systems can be developed with both static and dynamic reconfigurability. The Morphing Crossbar decreases the overhead of interconnection and remapping by allowing the system components to be modularized into relocatable modules. This method increases the flexibility of dynamic partial reconfigurable system. The Morphing Crossbar, which allows adding, removing, or swapping module blocks inside the system on the fly, was implemented on the Xilinx Virtex-5 architecture. Our experimental results demonstrate that by using Morphing Crossbar, adding, removing, and swapping modules can be performed 3.6 times faster compared to architectures without Morphing Crossbar.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heterogeneous modules interconnection architecture for FPGA-based partial dynamic reconfiguration","publicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322887","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313484/6322865/06322887.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A heterogeneous modules interconnection architecture for FPGA-based partial dynamic reconfiguration","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322887/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038070","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heterogeneous modules interconnection architecture for FPGA-based partial dynamic reconfiguration","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057048S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313484","isNumber":"6322865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313484","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6322865","articleId":"6322887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6322888,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This new node custom architecture is intended for high-end WSN applications that include complex sensor management like video cameras, high compute demanding tasks such as image encoding or robust encryption, and/or higher data bandwidth needs. In the case of these complex processing tasks, yet maintaining low power design requirements, it can be shown that the combination of different techniques such as extensive HW algorithm mapping, smart management of power islands to selectively switch on and off components, smart and low-energy partial reconfiguration, an adequate set of save energy modes and wake up options, all combined, may yield energy results that may compete and improve energy usage of typical low power microcontrollers used in many WSN node architectures. Actually, results show that higher complexity tasks are in favor of HW based platforms, while the flexibility achieved by dynamic and partial reconfiguration techniques could be comparable to SW based solutions.","publicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313484/6322865/06322888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power management techniques in an FPGA-based WSN node for high performance applications","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Power management techniques in an FPGA-based WSN node for high performance applications","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038071","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6322888/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power management techniques in an FPGA-based WSN node for high performance applications","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074152S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313484","isNumber":"6322865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313484","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6322865","articleId":"6322888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6322889,"authors":[{"name":"Siew-Kei Lam","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded Systems, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Siew-Kei","lastName":"Lam","id":"37332707100"},{"name":"Thambipillai Srikanthan","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded Systems, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Thambipillai","lastName":"Srikanthan","id":"37266928200"},{"name":"Christopher T.

As this evolution induces a change of the application execution paradigm, various tools have been set up to develop and manage these applications. But most do not allow direct re-use of legacy code, needing adaptation to match the provided environment. Moreover, partial reconfiguration is only at its early stages, and lacks easy ways of handling. We propose a design methodology and a runtime environment bringing fast integration of legacy hardware accelerators for partial and dynamic reconfigurable hardware architectures. Thanks to it, applications making use of dynamic hardware can be run directly on an Embedded Linux without noticing the reconfiguration flow. Moreover, our design methodology allows providing various implementations of a computation kernel, including both hardware and software ones. The implementation can then be chosen at execution time depending on available resources. In this article, we introduce the generic IP interface description making the reuse process possible. Furthermore, we present the results of a sample application running on our platform using software and hardware implementations. For hardware implementations, we obtain reconfiguration overhead as low as 0.16% of the total kernel execution time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322902","publicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313484/6322865/06322902.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast integration of hardware accelerators for dynamically reconfigurable architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fast integration of hardware accelerators for dynamically reconfigurable architecture","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6322902/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038085","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322902/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast integration of hardware accelerators for dynamically reconfigurable architecture","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"P3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049784S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313484","isNumber":"6322865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6322865","articleId":"6322902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6322903,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Llamocca","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Llamocca","id":"37392136200"},{"name":"Marios Pattichis","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Pattichis","id":"37266493300"},{"name":"Cesar Carranza","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Carranza","id":"37887694500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2572-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2570-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2571-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6322903","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322903","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Accuracy","Clocks","Optimization","IP networks","Field programmable gate arrays","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","Pareto optimisation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-reconfigurable DCT","multiobjective optimization","power-performance-accuracy space","self-reconfigurable 2D discrete cosine transforms","dynamic partial reconfiguration","DPR","dynamic frequency control","Pareto-optimal realizations","PPA space","2D DCT","power consumption","dynamic PPA management","time-varying PPA constraints","digital video processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration","Multi-objective Optimization","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","DCT"]}],"abstract":"We present a framework for the implementation of self-reconfigurable 2D Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCTs).

This type of networks resembles those found in biological systems studied by neuroscientists. This paper shows a hardware implementation for SNN. First, SNN require the inputs to be spikes, being necessary a conversion system (encoding) from digital values into spikes. For travelling spikes, each neuron interconnection is characterized by weights and delays, requiring an internal neuron processing by a Postsynaptic Potential (PSP) function and membrane potential threshold evaluation for a postsynaptic output spike generation. In order to model a real biological system by artificial SNN, the number of required neurons is very high (thousands). In this work, we propose a SNN architecture able to adapt big size networks using reduced hardware resources. While spikes are processed at 1ms time, inter spike time is used for internal calculations, a mixed serial-parallel structure allows optimized computation of all neuron output values. Results show that SNN can be accommodated using a medium-size FPGA device such as Xilinx Spartan 3 with processing speed comparable to fully parallel implementations with up to 70% resource reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322906","publicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313484/6322865/06322906.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast spiking neural network architecture for low-cost FPGA devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322906/","displayDocTitle":"Fast spiking neural network architecture for low-cost FPGA devices","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322906/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038089","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast spiking neural network architecture for low-cost FPGA devices","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"P7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083224S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313484","isNumber":"6322865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313484","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6322865","articleId":"6322906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6322907,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 L.

Nonetheless, neural networks are not so easily applied in embedded systems, specially when the fully retraining of the network is required. This paper shows the results of the implementation of artificial neural networks based on the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) in reconfigurable hardware, both in the steps of training and running. A hardware architecture has been developed to be applied as a co-processing unit and an example application has been used to test its functionality. The application has been developed for the prediction of approximate 3-D structures of proteins. A set of experiments have been performed on a PC using the FPGA as a co-processor accessed through sockets over the TCP/IP protocol. The design flow employed demonstrated that it is possible to implement the network in hardware to be easily applied as an accelerator in embedded systems. The experiments show that the proposed implementation is effective in finding good quality solutions for the example problem. This work represents the early results of the novel technique of applying the GMDH algorithms in hardware for solving the problem of protein structures prediction.","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322907","publicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"7th International Workshop on Reconfigurable and Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313484/6322865/06322907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6322865","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of GMDH-type artificial neural networks and its use to predict approximate three-dimensional structures of proteins","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of GMDH-type artificial neural networks and its use to predict approximate three-dimensional structures of proteins","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322907/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13038090","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6322907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of GMDH-type artificial neural networks and its use to predict approximate three-dimensional structures of proteins","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"P8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126812S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313484","isNumber":"6322865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6322865","articleId":"6322907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6322959,"authors":[{"name":"Snaider Carrillo","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Centre School of Computing, Intelligent Systems University of Ulster, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6648551/6322959/6322959-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Snaider Carrillo received the BEng (Hons) degree in electronic from the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, in 2006 and the MSc degree in electronic engineering (With a Magna Cum Laude Distinction) from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia, in 2008.

SNNs offer the possibility to implement embedded neuromorphic circuits, with high parallelism and low power consumption compared to the traditional von Neumann computer paradigms. Nevertheless, the lack of modularity and poor connectivity shown by traditional neuron interconnect implementations based on shared bus topologies is prohibiting scalable hardware implementations of SNNs. This paper presents a novel hierarchical network-on-chip (H-NoC) architecture for SNN hardware, which aims to address the scalability issue by creating a modular array of clusters of neurons using a hierarchical structure of low and high-level routers. The proposed H-NoC architecture incorporates a spike traffic compression technique to exploit SNN traffic patterns and locality between neurons, thus reducing traffic overhead and improving throughput on the network. In addition, adaptive routing capabilities between clusters balance local and global traffic loads to sustain throughput under bursting activity. Analytical results show the scalability of the proposed H-NoC approach under different scenarios, while simulation and synthesis analysis using 65-nm CMOS technology demonstrate high-throughput, low-cost area, and power consumption per cluster, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6648551/06322959.pdf","startPage":"2451","endPage":"2461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Hierarchical Network-on-Chip Architecture for Spiking Neural Network Hardware Implementations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6322959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322959/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Hierarchical Network-on-Chip Architecture for Spiking Neural Network Hardware Implementations","volume":"24","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13875732","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6322959/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Hierarchical Network-on-Chip Architecture for Spiking Neural Network Hardware Implementations","sourcePdf":"ttd2013122451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125495S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6648551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6648551","articleId":"6322959","onlineDate":"04 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6322986,"authors":[{"name":"Emilie Delaherche","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligen Systems and Robotics, ISIR-CNRS UMR 7222, University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165369/6322985/6322986/6322986-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emilie Delaherche received the MS degree in engineering from ESME Sudria (School of Engineering), Paris, 2005 and the MS degree in machine learning and signal processing from the University Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC), Paris, 2010.

The analysis of this phenomenon is complex, requiring the perception and integration of multimodal communicative signals. The evaluation of synchrony has received multidisciplinary attention because of its role in early development, language learning, and social connection. Originally studied by developmental psychologists, synchrony has now captured the interest of researchers in such fields as social signal processing, robotics, and machine learning. This paper emphasizes the current questions asked by synchrony evaluation and the state-of-the-art related methods. First, we present definitions and functions of synchrony in youth and adulthood. Next, we review the noncomputational and computational approaches of annotating, evaluating, and modeling interactional synchrony. Finally, the current limitations and future research directions in the fields of developmental robotics, social robotics, and clinical studies are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6322986/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-September  2012","volume":"3","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13034427","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","publicationDate":"July-September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6322986/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interpersonal Synchrony: A Survey of Evaluation Methods across Disciplines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpersonal Synchrony: A Survey of Evaluation Methods across Disciplines","sourcePdf":"tta2012030349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.215462S","chronDate":"July-September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"6322985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6322985","articleId":"6322986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6322996,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The key feature is that this tuning method adopts an inherent saturation property resulting from finite rules in practical application. Based on the saturation, fuzzy PID controller can be expressed as a sliding-mode controller that has two nonlinear terms: One plays as an equivalent control, and the other acts as a switching control. A nominal tuning is first presented to design a stable equivalent control using gain margin and phase margin. Then, a robust tuning is presented to design the switching control by using maximum sensitivity function or compensation sensitivity function. The maximum bound of uncertainty is given by the robust analysis. Finally, this proposed tuning method is used to control a clamp rotation of a forging manipulator. The simulations and real-time experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tuning method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2222858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2222858","startPage":"5177","endPage":"5185","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06323017.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Saturation-Based Tuning Method for Fuzzy PID Controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Saturation-Based Tuning Method for Fuzzy PID Controller","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","volume":"60","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6323017/","accessionNumber":"13563557","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6323017/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Saturation-Based Tuning Method for Fuzzy PID Controller","sourcePdf":"tie-duan-2222858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092523S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6323017","onlineDate":"04 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6323020,"authors":[{"name":"Manuela Sechilariu","affiliation":["University of Technology of Compiegne, Compiegne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6361304/6323020/6323020-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manuela Sechilariu (M'11) received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Polytechnical University of Iasi, Iasi, Romania, in 1986, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and automatic from the University of Angers, Angers, France, in 1993.","Since 2002, she has been an Associate Professor with the University of Compiegne, Compiegne, France.

One solution to this problem is to expand the role of microgrids that interact with the utility grid and operate independently in case of a limited availability during peak time or outage. This paper proposes, for urban areas, a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) primarily for self-feeding of buildings equipped with PV array and storage. With an aim of elimination of multiple energy conversions, a DC network distribution is considered. The BIPV can supply a tertiary building at the same time as PV array may produce power through a hierarchical supervision able to exchange messages with the smart grid and metadata. The hierarchical control is designed as an interface to expand the system ability for advanced energy management control having regard to the grid availability and user's commands. It consists of four layers: human-machine interface, prediction, cost management, and operation. The operation layer, implemented in an experimental platform, takes into account the grid supply power limits and constrains the DC load. The experimental results validate the approach that may be a solution for the future smart grid communication between BIPV and utility grid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6323020/","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6323020/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13146472","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Building Integrated Photovoltaic System With Energy Storage and Smart Grid Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building Integrated Photovoltaic System With Energy Storage and Smart Grid Communication","sourcePdf":"tie-locment-2222852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120213S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6361304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"6361304","articleId":"6323020","onlineDate":"04 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6323023,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Ta Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering/Advanced, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6409420/6323023/6323023-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ho-Ta Lin was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

The accurate prediction of SOH can help avoid inconveniences or fatal accidents from the sudden malfunction of the battery. A total of 110 pieces of Li-Co batteries are used. Constant current/voltage recharging and constant current discharging are performed for the life-cycle test of the battery. The data obtained from the recharging and discharging electric characteristics as well as the life-cycle test of the battery are used to estimate the SOH of the battery. The test data show that the constant current charging time, the instantaneous voltage drop at the start of discharging, and the open circuit voltage are the most important characteristics for estimating the SOH of the battery. The PNN is trained using 100 pieces of batteries. The remaining 10 pieces are used to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the PNN training using a number of samples is discussed and analyzed. The results show that the average error of the prediction is 0.28% and the standard deviation is 1.15%. The computation time of the PNN is 62.5 ms.

With this solution, 3-D face models are characterized by the energies contained in spherical harmonics with different frequencies, thereby enabling the capture of both gross shape and fine surface details of a 3-D facial surface. This is in clear contrast to most 3-D FR techniques which are either holistic or feature based, using local features extracted from distinctive points. First, 3-D face models are represented in a canonical representation, namely, spherical depth map, by which SHF can be calculated. Then, considering the predictive contribution of each SHF feature, especially in the presence of facial expression and occlusion, feature selection methods are used to improve the predictive performance and provide faster and more cost-effective predictors. Experiments have been carried out on three public 3-D face datasets, SHREC2007, FRGC v2.0, and Bosphorus, with increasing difficulties in terms of facial expression, pose, and occlusion, and which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2222897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6421028/06323031.pdf","startPage":"914","endPage":"925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2222897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning the Spherical Harmonic Features for 3-D Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6323031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6323031/","displayDocTitle":"Learning the Spherical Harmonic Features for 3-D Face Recognition","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13251892","pubMedId":"23060332","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6323031/","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning the Spherical Harmonic Features for 3-D Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-wang-2222897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128554S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6421028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6421028","articleId":"6323031","onlineDate":"04 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6323032,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Yao","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Paris Cedex, France"],"bio":{"p":["Jianfeng Yao entered the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Paris in 2008.

Among the conventional methods to estimate SoC, the Coulomb counting method is widely used, but its accuracy is limited due to the accumulated error. Another commonly used method is model-based online iterative estimation with the Kalman filters, which improves the estimation accuracy in some extent. To improve the performance of Kalman filters in SoC estimation, the adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), which employs the covariance matching approach, is applied in this paper. First, we built an implementation flowchart of the AEKF for a general system. Second, we built an online open-circuit voltage (OCV) estimation approach with the AEKF algorithm so that we can then get the SoC estimate by looking up the OCV-SoC table. Third, we proposed a robust online model-based SoC estimation approach with the AEKF algorithm. Finally, an evaluation on the SoC estimation approaches is performed by the experiment approach from the aspects of SoC estimation accuracy and robustness. The results indicate that the proposed online SoC estimation with the AEKF algorithm performs optimally, and for different error initial values, the maximum SoC estimation error is less than 2% with close-loop state estimation characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2222684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6410063/06323045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2222684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410063","startPage":"108","endPage":"117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation on State of Charge Estimation of Batteries With Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter by Experiment Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6323045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation on State of Charge Estimation of Batteries With Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter by Experiment Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6323045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219901","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6323045/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation on State of Charge Estimation of Batteries With Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter by Experiment Approach","sourcePdf":"tvt-he-2222684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071523S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6410063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"6410063","articleId":"6323045","onlineDate":"04 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6323048,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Oike","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6399535/6323048/6323048-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yusuke Oike (S'00\u2013M'05) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2000, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","In 2005, he joined Sony Corporation, Japan, where he has been engaged in research and development of architectures, circuits and devices for CMOS image sensors.

This paper presents a novel memory architecture called hybrid partitioned static random access memory-based ternary content addressable memory (HP SRAM-based TCAM), which emulates TCAM functionality with conventional SRAM, thereby eliminating the inherited disadvantages of conventional TCAMs. HP SRAM-based TCAM logically dissects conventional TCAM table in a hybrid way (column-wise and row-wise) into TCAM sub-tables, which are then processed to be mapped to their corresponding SRAM memory units. Search operation in HP SRAM-based TCAM involves two SRAM accesses followed by a logical ANDing operation. To validate and justify our approach, 512 \u00d7 36 HP SRAM-based TCAM has been implemented in Xilinx Virtex-5 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and designed using 65-nm CMOS technology. Implementation in FPGA is advantageous and a beauty of our proposed TCAM because classical TCAMs cannot be implemented in FPGA. After a thorough analysis, we have concluded that energy/bit/search of the proposed TCAM is 85.72 fJ.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215736","startPage":"2969","endPage":"2979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6359940/06323051.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Partitioned SRAM-Based Ternary Content Addressable Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6323051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Partitioned SRAM-Based Ternary Content Addressable Memory","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13146673","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6323051/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Partitioned SRAM-Based Ternary Content Addressable Memory","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ullah-2215736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11104S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6359940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6359940","articleId":"6323051","onlineDate":"04 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6323130,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Haond","affiliation":["CNET, Bagneux, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Haond","id":"37294061700"},{"name":"Duy-Phach Vu","affiliation":["Max-Planck-Institut fur Festkorperforschung, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Duy-Phach","lastName":"Vu","id":"37348877000"},{"name":"Agustin Monroy Aguirre","affiliation":["CNET, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Agustin Monroy","lastName":"Aguirre","id":"38488914600"},{"name":"Sylviane Perret","affiliation":["CNET, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Sylviane","lastName":"Perret","id":"38489299600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"8755-3996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1888"}],"articleNumber":"6323130","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society","url":"http://www.i-leos.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6323130","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Films","Silicon on insulator technology","Threshold voltage","Silicon","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit technology","recrystallisation","zone melting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC technology","SOI films","CMOS polysilicon gate process","electrical parameters","lamp zone-melting-recrystallization","n-channel","enhancement mode transistors","effective channel length","threshold voltage distribution","leakage current","ring oscillators","propagation delay time","1.7 micron","0.5 ns","0.9 V","Si"]}],"abstract":"Four-inch wafer lots have been processed in a conventional CMOS polysilicon gate process.

The authors compare the various methods of using distributed arithmetic in implementing fixed point digital filters. They introduce as a measure of hardware complexity the chip area needed to fabricate competing designs using nMOS technology. Comparisons of alternate realizations in hardware are also made. These comparisons are based on equating the output signal quality of each design. They show that traditional measures of complexity (such as the number of multipliers per output sample) do not agree with complexity measures based on chip area.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits & Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331049/6323740/06323744.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits & Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.1981.6323744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.1981.6323744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6323740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6323744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On comparing hardware implementations of fixed point digital filters","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","field effect integrated circuits","large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparing hardware implementations","fixed point digital filters","complexity measures based on chip area","NMOS technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6323744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1981","displayDocTitle":"On comparing hardware implementations of fixed point digital filters","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1981","accessionNumber":"1737420","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On comparing hardware implementations of fixed point digital filters","sourcePdf":"002008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026826S","chronDate":"June  1981","isNumber":"6323740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6331049","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6323744","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6323864,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper analyzes the phase noise mechanisms in CMOS phase/frequency detectors and applies the results to two different topologies. It is shown that an octave increase in the input frequency raises the phase noise by 6 dB if flicker noise is dominant and by 3 dB if white noise is dominant. An optimization methodology is also proposed that lowers the phase noise by 4 to 8 dB for a given power consumption. Simulation and analytical results agree to within 3.1 dB for the two topologies at different frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6468162/06324396.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Phase Noise in Phase/Frequency Detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324396/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Phase Noise in Phase/Frequency Detectors","volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13325859","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324396/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Phase Noise in Phase/Frequency Detectors","sourcePdf":"tcsi-homayoun-2215792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058006S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6468162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6468162","articleId":"6324396","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6324405,"authors":[{"name":"David Siegel","affiliation":["NSF Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["David Siegel is currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, and a research assistant for the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems.

Current existing helicopter health and usage monitoring systems provide diagnostic information that indicates when the condition of a drive train component is degraded; however, prediction techniques are not currently used. Although various algorithms exist for providing remaining life predictions, prognostic techniques have not fully matured. This particular study addresses remaining useful life predictions for the helicopter oil-cooler bearings. The paper proposes a general methodology of how to perform rolling element bearing prognostics, and presents the results using a robust regression curve fitting approach. The proposed methodology includes a series of processing steps prior to the prediction routine, including feature extraction, feature selection, and health assessment. This approach provides a framework for including prediction algorithms into existing health and usage monitoring systems. A case study with the data collected by Impact Technology, LLC. is analysed using the proposed methodology. Future work would consider using the same methodology, but comparing the accuracy of this prediction method with Bayesian filtering techniques, usage based methods, and other time series prediction methods.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2012.2220697","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/6362257/06324405.pdf","startPage":"846","endPage":"857","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2012.2220697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodology and Framework for Predicting Helicopter Rolling Element Bearing Failure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Methodology and Framework for Predicting Helicopter Rolling Element Bearing Failure","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13146749","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6324405/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodology and Framework for Predicting Helicopter Rolling Element Bearing Failure","sourcePdf":"tr-siegel-2220697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069512S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"6362257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6362257","articleId":"6324405","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6324407,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Bizzarri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/6481467/6324407/6324407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Federico Bizzarri (M'12) was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1974.

The key idea of SAO is to reduce sample distortion by first classifying reconstructed samples into different categories, obtaining an offset for each category, and then adding the offset to each sample of the category. The offset of each category is properly calculated at the encoder and explicitly signaled to the decoder for reducing sample distortion effectively, while the classification of each sample is performed at both the encoder and the decoder for saving side information significantly. To achieve low latency of only one coding tree unit (CTU), a CTU-based syntax design is specified to adapt SAO parameters for each CTU. A CTU-based optimization algorithm can be used to derive SAO parameters of each CTU, and the SAO parameters of the CTU are inter leaved into the slice data. It is reported that SAO achieves on average 3.5% BD-rate reduction and up to 23.5% BD-rate reduction with less than 1% encoding time increase and about 2.5% decoding time increase under common test conditions of HEVC reference software version 8.0.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2221529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2221529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6403920/06324411.pdf","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample Adaptive Offset in the HEVC Standard","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sample Adaptive Offset in the HEVC Standard","volume":"22","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324411/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13219087","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324411/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample Adaptive Offset in the HEVC Standard","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-han-2221529-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127554S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6403920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"6403920","articleId":"6324411","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6324412,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Koo Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6403920/6324412/6324412-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Il-Koo Kim received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999, 2001, and 2006, respectively.","He has been with the Digital Media and Communications Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea, since 2006, where he has been engaged in development of high-efficiency video codecs.

This paper describes the block partitioning structure of the draft HEVC standard and presents the results of an analysis of coding efficiency and complexity. Of the many new technical aspects of HEVC, the block partitioning structure has been identified as representing one of the most significant changes relative to previous video coding standards. In contrast to the fixed size 16 \u00d7 16 macroblock structure of H.264/AVC, HEVC defines three different units according to their functionalities. The coding unit defines a region sharing the same prediction mode, e.g., intra and inter, and it is represented by the leaf node of a quadtree structure. The prediction unit defines a region sharing the same prediction information. The transform unit, specified by another quadtree, defines a region sharing the same transformation. This paper introduces technical details of the block partitioning structure of HEVC with an emphasis on the method of designing a consistent framework by combining the three different units together. Experimental results are provided to justify the role of each component of the block partitioning structure and a comparison with the H.264/AVC design is performed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Partitioning Structure in the HEVC Standard","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223011","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6403920/06324412.pdf","startPage":"1697","endPage":"1706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Block Partitioning Structure in the HEVC Standard","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6324412/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13219088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Partitioning Structure in the HEVC Standard","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-han-2223011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088549S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6403920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"295","xplore-issue":"6403920","articleId":"6324412","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6324414,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Norkin","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6403920/6324414/6324414-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrey Norkin received the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Ural State Technical University, Yekaterinburg, Russia, in 2001, and the Doctor of Science degree in signal processing from the Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, in 2007.","From 2002 to 2007, he was a Researcher with the Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology.

The examined software codecs are HM 6.0 using Main Profile (MP) and JM 18.0 using High Profile (HiP). These codes are benchmarked under the all-intra (AI), random access (RA), low-delay \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n (LB), and low-delay \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n (LP) coding configurations. In order to obtain a fair comparison, JM HiP anchor codec has been configured to conform to HM MP settings and coding configurations. The rate-distortion comparisons rely on objective quality assessments, i.e., bit rate differences for equal PSNR. The complexities of HM and JM have been profiled at the cycle level with Intel VTune on Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The coding efficiency of HEVC is drastically better than that of AVC. According to our experiments, the average bit rate decrements of HM MP over JM HiP are 23%, 35%, 40%, and 35% under the AI, RA, LB, and LP configurations, respectively. However, HM achieves its coding gain with a realistic overhead in complexity. Our profiling results show that the average software complexity ratios of HM MP and JM HiP encoders are 3.2\u00d7 in the AI case, 1.2\u00d7 in the RA case, 1.5\u00d7 in the LB case, and 1.3\u00d7 in the LP case. The respective ratios with HM MP and JM HiP decoders are 2.0\u00d7, 1.6\u00d7, 1.5\u00d7, and 1.4\u00d7. This paper also reveals the bottlenecks of HM codec and provides implementation guidelines for future real-time HEVC codecs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13219096","htmlLink":"/document/6324420/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparative Rate-Distortion-Complexity Analysis of HEVC and AVC Video Codecs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Rate-Distortion-Complexity Analysis of HEVC and AVC Video Codecs","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-vanne-2223013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178962S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6403920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"6403920","articleId":"6324420","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6324428,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Huei Kuan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Patent, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/17/6558868/6324428/6324428-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chung-Huei Kuan received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University in 1983, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering and management from the mechanical engineering Department, National Taiwan University, in 2012.","He is currently an Assistant Professor at the Graduate Institute of Patent, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.

This approach is capable of producing a snapshot to a large number of assignees' portfolio performance by simultaneously depicting their h-complement area centroids in a 2-D graph. With this 2-D view, these assignees' relative performance, where the performance difference lies, and the degree of such difference can also be quickly determined. In addition, a trajectory manifesting the evolution of an assignee's portfolio performance over a window of time can be obtained by connecting the h-complement area centroids at successive epochs within the time window. The pattern revealed by the trajectory provides significant insight into how the assignee's portfolio performance has varied over time. When there is some abrupt pattern change, an analyst should be alarmed to conduct further investigation. A steady pattern, on the other hand, allows forecast to the assignee's future performance.","doi":"10.1109/TEM.2012.2216882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6558868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2012.2216882","endPage":"505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/17/6558868/06324428.pdf","startPage":"496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capturing and Tracking Performance of Patent Portfolio Using --Complement Area Centroid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324428/","displayDocTitle":"Capturing and Tracking Performance of Patent Portfolio Using <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$h$ </tex></formula>-Complement Area Centroid","volume":"60","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13655684","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6324428/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capturing and Tracking Performance of Patent Portfolio Using <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$h$ </tex></formula>-Complement Area Centroid","sourcePdf":"tem-chen-2216882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085783S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"17","isNumber":"6558868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6558868","articleId":"6324428","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6324431,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Fanucci","affiliation":["University of Pisa and Consorzio Pisa Ricerche, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6450120/6324431/6324431-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Fanucci (M'95) received the Laurea and the Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 1992 and 1996, respectively.","From 1992 to 1996, he was with the European Space Agency\u2014ESTEC, Noordwijk (NL), as a Research Fellow.

The actual out-of-hospital treatment model, based on periodic visits, has a low capability to detect signs of destabilization and leads to a high re-hospitalization rate. To this aim, in this paper, a complete and integrated Information and Communication Technology system is described enabling the CHF patients to daily collect vital signs at home and automatically send them to the Hospital Information System, allowing the physicians to monitor their patients at distance and take timely actions in case of necessity. A minimum set of vital parameters has been identified, consisting of electrocardiogram, SpO2, blood pressure, and weight, measured through a pool of wireless, non-invasive biomedical sensors. A multi-channel front-end IC for cardiac sensor interfacing has been also developed. Sensor data acquisition and signal processing are in charge of an additional device, the home gateway. All signals are processed upon acquisition in order to assert if both punctual values and extracted trends lay in a safety zone established by thresholds. Per-patient personalized thresholds, required measurements and transmission policy are allowed. As proved by first medical tests, the proposed telemedicine platform represents a valid support to early detect the alterations in vital signs that precede the acute syndromes, allowing early home interventions thus reducing the number of subsequent hospitalizations.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2218681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6450120/06324431.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2218681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing Devices and Sensor Signal Processing for Remote Monitoring of Vital Signs in CHF Patients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324431/","displayDocTitle":"Sensing Devices and Sensor Signal Processing for Remote Monitoring of Vital Signs in CHF Patients","volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13284819","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324431/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing Devices and Sensor Signal Processing for Remote Monitoring of Vital Signs in CHF Patients","sourcePdf":"tim-fanucci-2218681-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145295S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6450120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6450120","articleId":"6324431","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6324433,"authors":[{"name":"Henry Arguello","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6421028/6324433/6324433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Henry Arguello (S'11) received the Master's degree in electrical engineering from the Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, and the Ph.D. degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Delaware, Newark.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Systems Engineering Department, Universidad Industrial de Santander.

Furthermore, each code aperture set forms a matrix such that rank minimization is used to reduce the number of CASSI shots needed.

More specifically, the asymptotic mean and variance of the mutual information are derived in this asymptotic regime, and it is shown that the corresponding probability distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution. All these results are based on the replica method, whose mathematical principles are discussed in this study. The ergodic capacity is also addressed by deriving an iterative water-filling algorithm yielding the capacity-achieving input covariance matrix (under an average power constraint). Resorting to the asymptotic Gaussianity of the mutual information distribution, an analytic expression of the outage capacity is derived based on the mean and variance of the mutual information. Finally, numerical results are reported to assess the level of approximation of the analytic results in comparison with those obtained by Monte Carlo simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2223195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6413249/06324440.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2223195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further Results on the Asymptotic Mutual Information of Rician Fading MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324440/","displayDocTitle":"Further Results on the Asymptotic Mutual Information of Rician Fading MIMO Channels","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234724","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324440/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further Results on the Asymptotic Mutual Information of Rician Fading MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-taricco-2223195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127414S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6413249","articleId":"6324440","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6324450,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Pe\u00f1a-Alzola","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg East, Denmark"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Pe\u00f1a-Alzola","id":"37079046700"},{"name":"Marco Liserre","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg East, Denmark"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Liserre","id":"37272424200"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg East, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"},{"name":"Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Control Engineering, National University for Distance Learning (UNED), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Sebasti\u00e1n","id":"37407891800"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Dannehl","affiliation":["Danfoss Solar Inverters, S\u00f8nderborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Dannehl","id":"37293773700"},{"name":"Friedrich Wilhelm Fuchs","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Friedrich Wilhelm","lastName":"Fuchs","id":"38324288900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6324450","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":378,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":5515},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Resistors","Harmonic analysis","Capacitors","Power harmonic filters","Power system stability","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive filters","power filters","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive damping losses","LCL-filter-based grid converters","adopted method","switching frequencies","sampling frequencies","minimum resistor value","stable current control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LCL-filter","passive damping","stability","voltage-source converter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324450","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6376188/06324450.pdf","startPage":"2642","endPage":"2646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2222931","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2222931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Passive Damping Losses in LCL-Filter-Based Grid Converters","abstract":"Passive damping is the most adopted method to guarantee the stability of LCL-filter-based grid converters.

The obtained saliency map is also inconsistent with many properties of human behavior. In order to overcome the challenges of inability and inconsistency, this paper presents a framework based on multiple-instance learning. Low-, mid-, and high-level features are incorporated in the detection procedure, and the learning ability enables it robust to noise. Experiments on a data set containing 1000 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In a network with frequency reuse factor of one, intercell interference is a limiting factor. The max-min beamforming technique enables a balancing of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all users in a network under a power budget. Thus, a fair distribution of the achievable rate can be achieved. The max-min beamforming problem (MBP) is nonconvex in general. However, if instantaneous channel-state information (CSI) is available, the MBP has an equivalent quasiconvex form and can optimally be solved with an efficient algorithm based on a convex solver. In addition to this convex-solver-based solution, this paper considers the so-called surrogate dual problem of the MBP with per-antenna and per-antenna-array power constraints. The surrogate dual problem combines multiple power constraints to a single power constraint. Furthermore, the surrogate dual problem can efficiently be solved for long-term CSI in the form of spatial correlation matrices. Strong duality is proved for instantaneous and long-term CSI in the form of higher rank spatial correlation matrices. With the surrogate dual problem, a fast algorithm for the MBP is presented. The convergence issue is discussed. Numerical results verify the convergence and the performance of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 October 2012","volume":"62","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13307157","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324461/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Duality of the Max\u2013Min Beamforming Problem With Per-Antenna and Per-Antenna-Array Power Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Duality of the Max\u2013Min Beamforming Problem With Per-Antenna and Per-Antenna-Array Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"tvt-dartmann-2222946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142933S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6324461","onlineDate":"05 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6324462,"authors":[{"name":"Kamel Tourki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas, Texas A and M University, Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Kamel","lastName":"Tourki","id":"37297019400"},{"name":"Khalid A.

In this paper, we investigate an underlay cognitive network where the quality of service (QoS) of the secondary link is maintained by triggering an opportunistic regenerative relaying once it falls under an unacceptable level. Analysis is conducted for two schemes, referred to as the channel-state information (CSI)-based and fault-tolerant schemes, respectively, where different amounts of CSI were considered. We first provide the exact cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over each hop with colocated relays.

In multipath environment the performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is improved by introducing some kind of channel coding. Coded OFDM (COFDM) is the new candidate for application such as Digital audio Broadcast (DAB) and Digital Video Broadcast (DVB-T) due to its better performance in fading environment. However high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) is a major demerit of OFDM system, it leads to increased complexity of circuit and reduced efficiency of RF amplifier. In this paper our aim is PAPR reduction of COFDM system using Discrete Hartley Transform (DHT) pre-coding and performance analysis in fading environment using BER as a performance index. COFDM system used here comply with IEEE 802.11a specifications and Reed Solomon (RS) codes along with convolution codes are used for serial concatenation and TURBO codes are used as parallel concatenation codes for channel coding purpose. Channel used for consideration is Rayleigh.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Instrumentation & Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation

The adaptive array uses the least mean square (LMS) algorithm for beamforming, which minimizes the mean square error (MSE) between the received pilot signal and the reference one. The LMS system proofed to be very efficient in interference cancellation, steering toward the signal direction of arrival (DOA), and improving the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In addition an adaptive bit loading algorithm is also proposed in this paper which improves the overall throughput of the algorithm by assigning higher order modulation schemes to subcarriers with high SNR and more robust modulation schemes such as BPSK or DBPSK to subcarriers with low SNR. The performance of the suggested OFDM system is investigated and compared to the conventional OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/MSNA.2012.6324523","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Instrumentation & Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Instrumentation & Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313483/6324499/06324523.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSNA.2012.6324523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324499","startPage":"95","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and simulation of a variable bit load adaptive OFDM transceiver for frequency selective channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and simulation of a variable bit load adaptive OFDM transceiver for frequency selective channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324523/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13059091","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6324523/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and simulation of a variable bit load adaptive OFDM transceiver for frequency selective channel","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"Vol1025MA001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087886S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313483","isNumber":"6324499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313483","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6324499","articleId":"6324523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6324525,"authors":[{"name":"Grigore Stamatescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Grigore","lastName":"Stamatescu","id":"37396572700"},{"name":"Valentin Sg\u00e2rciu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Sg\u00e2rciu","id":"37546374100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2467-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2465-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2466-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6324525","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324525","abstract":"Small-scale, medium-term deployments are an important tool when planning to install a wireless sensor network (WSN) monitoring system. It is vital to assess the software and hardware reliability of the desired solution in a well specified scenario. Also, it allows the system designer to evaluate beforehand the radio environment, a critical task in crowded environments such as buildings. The multitude of walls and large metal objects can produce unwanted effects such as fading and multi-path reflections while high powered radio devices produce interference when operating in the same band as the sensor nodes. This leads to a high packet loss rate and affect battery life through increased number of packet retransmissions. In this paper we report our results from a week long continues monitoring of an indoor space. Our focus is on sampling data for temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and ambient light. We analyze the results and provide experience regarding future real systems aimed at high spatial resolution measurements of environmental parameters indoors. Our study concerns sensor data, energy consumption of sensor nodes and radio channel characterization. A network sniffer is also employed to provide insight into the behaviour of the wireless mesh networking protocol. We consider that the relevance of our work can be highlighted in saved costs associated with maintenance operations and man-hours after a final, large-scale deployment of WSN instrumentation has already taken place.","doi":"10.1109/MSNA.2012.6324525","startPage":"107","endPage":"111","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Instrumentation & Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313483/6324499/06324525.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Instrumentation & Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSNA.2012.6324525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of wireless sensor network monitoring for indoor spaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Monitoring","Base stations","Buildings","Temperature measurement","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["barometers","humidity sensors","instrumentation","sensor placement","temperature sensors","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","indoor space monitoring","radio environment","critical task","crowded environments","multipath reflections","sampling data","temperature monitoring","humidity monitoring","barometric pressure monitoring","ambient light monitoring","radio channel characterization","network sniffer","WSN instrumentation deployment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of wireless sensor network monitoring for indoor spaces","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6324525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13059093","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of wireless sensor network monitoring for indoor spaces","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"Vol1027MA006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043782S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313483","isNumber":"6324499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313483","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6324499","articleId":"6324525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6324542,"authors":[{"name":"Saiqiu Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan City University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Saiqiu","lastName":"Guo","id":"38488866900"},{"name":"Jingmin Tang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Jingmin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37673274600"},{"name":"Yu Wei","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wei","id":"38488963200"},{"name":"Wuke Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Hunan Arts and Science University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wuke","lastName":"Li","id":"38490323900"},{"name":"Chunping Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Chunping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38489979700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2467-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2465-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2466-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6324542","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324542","abstract":"A relay selection algorithm is proposed to improve the system performance based on statistical channel state information(CSI) in amplify-and-forward(AF) cooperative networks.

In this study, the infant face region is segmented based on the skin colour information. Two types of features, namely Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Power Spectrum are then calculated based on the information available from the infant face regions. Since each type of features in turn contains several different values, given a single fifteen-frame sequence, the correlation coefficients between those features of the same type can form the attribute vector of pain and normal facial expressions. Fifteen infant facial expression classes have been defined in this study.

This paper presents a scheme of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) SAR using chirp diverse waveform for wide-swath remote sensing. This approach employs MIMO antenna configuration in elevation which is divided into multiple subpertures. In this way, multiple pairs of transmit-receive virtual beams directing to different subswathes are formed simultaneously. Equivalently a large swath is synthesized. The corresponding system scheme, chirp diverse waveform design, multi-beam forming algorithm and range ambiguity performance are investigated. A chirp-scaling-based image formation algorithm is presented to focus the MIMO SAR simulation data. Comprehensive numerical simulation examples are performed. It is shown that the proposed method enables the SAR systems to operate with high flexibility and reconfigurability which is particularly attractive for next generation remote sensing technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/6324657/06324689.pdf","startPage":"3171","endPage":"3185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2012.6324689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2012.6324689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324657","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO SAR using Chirp Diverse Waveform for Wide-Swath Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","MIMO","Azimuth","Remote sensing","Chirp modulation","Arrays","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture antennas","MIMO radar","multibeam antennas","numerical analysis","radar antennas","radar imaging","receiving antennas","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","transmitting antennas","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO SAR system","wide-swath remote sensing","synthetic aperture radar","single-antenna SAR system","multiple-input and multiple-output SAR","MIMO antenna configuration","antenna elevation","subperture antenna","transmit-receive virtual beam","chirp diverse waveform design","multibeam forming algorithm","range ambiguity performance","chirp-scaling-based image formation algorithm","numerical simulation","next generation remote sensing technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"MIMO SAR using Chirp Diverse Waveform for Wide-Swath Remote Sensing","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6324689/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13034451","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO SAR using Chirp Diverse Waveform for Wide-Swath Remote Sensing","sourcePdf":"48aes04-Wang1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129908S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6324657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6324657","articleId":"6324689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6324705,"authors":[{"name":"Lee K.

Iterative algorithms for solving this problem have been proposed in the literature, but the algorithms are only applicable in limited cases, and the convergent behavior of these algorithms has not been established. We connect waveform design to the well-studied problem of phase retrieval. This is useful for explaining the success of the proposed iterative methods. We generalize and extend the existing algorithms to handle the case in which the dimensions of the time domain waveform and the frequency domain data are unequal, and we provide a convergence analysis. We also relate the phase retrieval problem to the problem of synthesizing discrete time constant modulus signals from power spectral density (PSD) data, which is different and more appropriate for the waveform design problem. We compare the iterative methods to direct search gradient methods for both problems, and establish that the proposed algorithms can provide comparable performance with reduced computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2012.6324705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/6324657/06324705.pdf","startPage":"3287","endPage":"3302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2012.6324705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Retrieval for Radar Waveform Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324705/","displayDocTitle":"Phase Retrieval for Radar Waveform Optimization","volume":"48","issue":"4","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13034458","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324705/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Retrieval for Radar Waveform Optimization","sourcePdf":"48aes04-Patton.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112416S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6324657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6324657","articleId":"6324705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6324709,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Hao Cheng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/6324657/6324709/6324709-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Hao Cheng (S'96-M'99-SM'04) received his B.S. degree in control engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1991, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Texas at Austin in 1996 and 1998, respectively, both in electrical and computer engineering.","Dr. Cheng is currently an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Miami University, Oxford, OH.

Instead, it is usually assumed that all targets are always resolved, and that the only uncertainties in the data association are which targets that are detected, and which measurement each detected target gave rise to. However, in situations where the targets are closely spaced in relation to the sensor resolution, this assumption is not valid, and may lead to degraded tracking performance due to an incorrect description of the data. We present a framework for handling sensor resolution effects for an arbitrary, but known, number of targets. We propose a complete multitarget sensor resolution model that can be incorporated into traditional Bayesian tracking filters. Further, the exact form of the posterior probability density function (pdf) is derived, and two alternative ways of approximating that exact posterior density with a joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter are proposed. Evaluations of the resulting filters on simulated radar data show significantly increased tracking performance compared with the JPDA filter without a resolution model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2012.6324722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/6324657/06324722.pdf","startPage":"3418","endPage":"3434","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2012.6324722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitarget Sensor Resolution Model and Joint Probabilistic Data Association","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multitarget Sensor Resolution Model and Joint Probabilistic Data Association","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6324722/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13034466","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitarget Sensor Resolution Model and Joint Probabilistic Data Association","sourcePdf":"48aes04-Svensson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097514S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6324657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6324657","articleId":"6324722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6324728,"authors":[{"name":"Sigurd Huber","affiliation":["Microwaves and Radar Institute, German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/6324657/6324728/6324728-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sigurd Huber received the Dipl.-Ing.

These requirements impose contradicting constraints on conventional SAR systems using analog beamforming technology. The development for future radar satellites is therefore towards digital beamforming (DBF) systems where the analogous receiver hardware is replaced by digital components. Concerning the SAR antenna the innovative concept of a parabolic mesh reflector in conjunction with a digital feed array is becoming a promising architecture for this new SAR system generation. These antennas, already a mature technique for communication satellites, have the potential to outperform planar array antennas in terms of gain at a moderate hardware effort. This article provides a hardware concept study based on a design in X-band.

This paper considers the sensor allocation problem for multi-target tracking (MTT), in which a group of sensors are dynamically selected and allocated to track each of the multiple targets and collaborate within the group via track data fusion. The sensor assignments evolve over time as targets move, and are accomplished by solving a constrained optimization problem that is formulated to maximize the overall tracking performance for all targets, while conserving network energy and providing tracking coverage guarantee. The original integer-valued optimization problem is relaxed to a convex program for computational tractability, and then implemented in a distributed manner for network scalability and reduced communication costs. Through local one-hop communication with neighboring nodes, each sensor autonomously decides on whether to participate in data collection and how to contribute to track fusion. The proposed distributed sensor allocation algorithm, implemented via iterative subgradient search, is shown to converge to the global optimum of the centralized relaxed problem, and is near optimal for the original integer programming problem.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2012.6324736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2012.6324736","startPage":"3538","endPage":"3553","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/6324657/06324736.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Sensor Allocation for Multi-Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Sensor Allocation for Multi-Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","volume":"48","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324736/","accessionNumber":"13034473","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324736/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Sensor Allocation for Multi-Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"48aes04-Fu2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080992S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6324657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6324657","articleId":"6324736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6324749,"authors":[{"name":"Alfred J.

Range-dependent clutter suppression using the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique is investigated. By employing the MIMO technique, the clutter ridges of all range bins are located in the same plane of the three-dimensional (3D) space. Moreover as long as the sum of the target radial velocities relative to the transmitter and the receiver is unequal to zero, the target will not be located in this plane. Thus clutter suppression can be realized by a 3D linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) filter. In high clutter-to-noise (CNR) cases, the presented technique yields better performance than the conventional bistatic sidelooking phased-array radar. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented technique.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2012.6324751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/6324657/06324751.pdf","startPage":"3647","endPage":"3654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2012.6324751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range-Dependent Clutter Suppression for Airborne Sidelooking Radar using MIMO Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324751/","displayDocTitle":"Range-Dependent Clutter Suppression for Airborne Sidelooking Radar using MIMO Technique","volume":"48","issue":"4","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13034481","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324751/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range-Dependent Clutter Suppression for Airborne Sidelooking Radar using MIMO Technique","sourcePdf":"48aes04-Wu-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132869S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"6324657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6324657","articleId":"6324751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6324753,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Friedlander","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Friedlander","id":"37268592100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"6324753","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":928},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Radar antennas","MIMO radar","Equations","Matched filters","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal models","MIMO radar","multiple-input multiple-output radar","point scatterers","scatterer delays","out-of-bin radar returns"]}],"abstract":"A detailed model for the signal received by a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar from point scatterers is derived and compared with a simplified model frequently used in the literature.

This choice can be made specifically for each subcarrier and completely independently of each other. Thus, extensive spectrum shaping is possible, which makes OFDM ideal for Cognitive Radio (CR) and related technologies. However, in classical OFDM systems, the subcarrier flexibility is applicable anywhere but not to the synchronization preamble. This paper proposes a novel time and frequency synchronization technique on basis of the Hiperlan/2 preamble which was made spectrally fully flexible. Its robustness and accuracy was proven with simulations and measurements on an FPGA-based Software Defined Radio (SDR) implementation. The synchronization can compete with popular unflexible algorithms under AWGN and Rayleigh channels, while the impact of any subcarrier reallocation is negligible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust time and frequency synchronization for OFDM systems with maximum spectrum flexibility","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2012.6324940","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313473/6324891/06324940.pdf","startPage":"856","endPage":"860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2012.6324940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6324940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6324940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust time and frequency synchronization for OFDM systems with maximum spectrum flexibility","conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6324940/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13059021","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust time and frequency synchronization for OFDM systems with maximum spectrum flexibility","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063972S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313473","isNumber":"6324891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313473","xplore-issue":"6324891","articleId":"6324940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6324953,"authors":[{"name":"P.A. van Jaarsveld","affiliation":["Vodacom Private Limited, Sandton, South Africa"],"firstName":"P.A.","lastName":"van Jaarsveld","id":"38488873400"},{"name":"G.

To improve the efficiency, many parameters should be considered in the design stage, such as the structural parameters of the drive coils and the armature, trigger discharge position of armature and the parameters of power supply. In this paper, an optimal design method considering 11 parameters is proposed to improve the energy conversion efficiency of a three-stage coilgun. In order to avoid costly trials, the current filament method (CFM) is employed to analyze the operations of different structural coilguns with different parameters respectively. And the orthogonal test approach is used to guide the simulation for choosing the better parameters' combination, as well reducing the calculation cost. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves a better result in the energy efficiency of the system.","doi":"10.1109/EML.2012.6325029","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6314417/6324992/06325029.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EML.2012.6325029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter optimization of multi-stage coilgun using orthogonal test approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Coilguns","Optimization","Capacitors","Energy conversion","Drives","Discharges (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct energy conversion","electromagnetic launchers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter optimization","multistage coilgun","orthogonal test approach","energy conversion efficiency","synchronous induction coilgun","design stage","structural parameters","drive coils","armature","trigger discharge position","power supply","optimal design method","current filament method","CFM","structural coilguns","energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Parameter optimization of multi-stage coilgun using orthogonal test approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325029/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2012","accessionNumber":"13059250","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter optimization of multi-stage coilgun using orthogonal test approach","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"60Zhang2228249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067263S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6314417","isNumber":"6324992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6314417","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6324992","articleId":"6325029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6325046,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38489605200"},{"name":"Wei Guo","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Guo","id":"38489957000"},{"name":"Honghai Zhang","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Honghai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38490438900"},{"name":"Bin Cao","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Cao","id":"38490260400"},{"name":"Kai Huang","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Huang","id":"38489563200"},{"name":"Ren Ren","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Ren","id":"38490209200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0305-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0306-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0304-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6325046","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325046","abstract":"An improved large-caliber synchronous induction coilgun was tested to demonstrate the launch of 120-mm projectiles.

However, the data obtained suffered from electromagnetic interference. Therefore, the measurement system was considerably improved with respect to the signal quality. In this publication the results obtained during the dynamic operation of the ISL railgun RAFIRA are presented. The magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the rails was measured at different armature velocities. Additional information was obtained using high-speed camera snapshots. The experimental results are compared with simulations performed with the finite element code COMSOL Multiphysics. In particular, the influence of the armature current on the measurements is discussed. It is concluded that the magnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the rails clearly indicates an increased current concentration in the rear part of the armature-rail contact interface. Moreover, the current concentration depends on the speed of the armature. Velocity-dependent skin depths at the surface of aluminum (Dural) rails for projectile velocities ranging between 750 m/s and 1500 m/s are given.","doi":"10.1109/EML.2012.6325056","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6314417/6324992/06325056.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EML.2012.6325056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324992","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Velocity-induced current profiles inside the rails of an electric launcher","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Velocity-induced current profiles inside the rails of an electric launcher","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325056/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13059277","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6325056/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Velocity-induced current profiles inside the rails of an electric launcher","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"254liebfried2409993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05373S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6314417","isNumber":"6324992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6314417","xplore-issue":"6324992","articleId":"6325056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6325076,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Several approaches for increasing L' have been suggested. one of these is the stacked railgun, also known as N-turn railgun. Since current density is the decisive factor to transition velocity, this study focuses on the current distribution in armature. The inductance gradient of railgun and magnetic field distribution are also investigated. The L' of conventional railguns is typically in the range of 0.4 to 0.7 \u03bcH/m, depending on detailed rail geometry. thus a two-turn railgun should be expected to have an L' approaching higher than simple railgun. in this study we will simulate two kinds of railgun including simple railgun and Two-Turn railgun, with finite element method(FEM) and we will compare them. In order to simplify simulations and comparing, rails and armatures of railguns are same. The simple railgun is selected as the benchmark, and the Two-Turn railgun was compared with it. In Two-Turn railgun simulation, the same current source as in simple railgun was connected to rails. Based on simulation results, conclusions are drawn that Two-Turn railgun has the higher inductance gradient and the current density at armatures shoulder is larger. Projectiles of Two-Turn railgun will face the greater magnetic flux density. A finite-element method is discussed to simulate two three-dimensional railguns in this study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison between conventional railgun and two-turn railgun by 3D- FEM","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","doi":"10.1109/EML.2012.6325089","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6314417/6324992/06325089.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EML.2012.6325089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Comparison between conventional railgun and two-turn railgun by 3D- FEM","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325089/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13059304","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between conventional railgun and two-turn railgun by 3D- FEM","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"43Bayati2474549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055486S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6314417","isNumber":"6324992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6314417","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6324992","articleId":"6325089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6325108,"authors":[{"name":"Weimin Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Guan","id":"38489707800"},{"name":"Yonghe Li","affiliation":["CEET PingGao Group Company Limited, Pingdingshan, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Yonghe","lastName":"Li","id":"37279887400"},{"name":"Kejie Dai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Kejie","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085917292"},{"name":"Jiangjun Ruan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiangjun","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37448052700"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540186900"},{"name":"Zhiye Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhiye","lastName":"Du","id":"37534450600"},{"name":"Yadong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yadong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538287500"},{"name":"Hailong Zhang","affiliation":["Wuhan NARI Company Limited, State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38490416300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0305-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0306-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0304-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6325108","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325108","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","Eddy currents","Force","Shock absorbers","Magnetic cores","Coils","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","coils","eddy currents","electromagnetic launchers","finite element analysis","force","magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element modeling","force distribution","induction damper","design improvement","plunger","3D finite element method","flux distribution","eddy current distribution","3D eddy current analysis","magnetic field","Lorentz force","nodal force method","iron yoke","coil","iron core","skin effect"]}],"abstract":"For the numerical investigation and design improvement of induction dampers, the eddy current and force distribution on the plunger of a single stage induction damper is analyzed using the three dimensional (3D) finite element method.

Such a simulation involves large gradients of the electromagnetic fields, large structures of the order of meters with areas of interest in the sub-millimeter range, a fast moving projectile causing a rapid change of the current flow through the volume in the next vicinity of the contact. Nevertheless, recent developments in FEM tools make it attractive to attempt such a simulation.

It is shown that orifices with the optimum distribution can play the greatest role in adjusting the damping coefficient, providing guidelines for the design and application of ERSFD.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Orifices","Force","Damping","Films","Shock absorbers","Flywheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","flywheels","orifices (mechanical)","shock absorbers","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orifice distribution","elastic ring squeeze film dampers","flywheel energy storage system","damping characteristics","ERSFD","FESS","finite element method","FEM","oil-film force","axial direction","circumferential direction","optimum orifice location","orifice radius"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EML.2012.6325126","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6314417/6324992/06325126.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EML.2012.6325126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of orifice distribution on the characteristics of Elastic Ring Squeeze Film Dampers for Flywheel Energy Storage System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of orifice distribution on the characteristics of Elastic Ring Squeeze Film Dampers for Flywheel Energy Storage System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325126/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325126/","accessionNumber":"13059341","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of orifice distribution on the characteristics of Elastic Ring Squeeze Film Dampers for Flywheel Energy Storage System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"143Xu2401755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059765S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6314417","isNumber":"6324992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6314417","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6324992","articleId":"6325126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6325128,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiye Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Zhiye","lastName":"Du","id":"37534450600"},{"name":"Shoubao Liu","affiliation":["Sichuan Electric Power Research Institute, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Shoubao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538540400"},{"name":"Jiangjun Ruan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Jiangjun","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37448052700"},{"name":"Yadong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yadong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538287500"},{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38189776000"},{"name":"Guodong Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Huang","id":"38237177300"},{"name":"Caibo Liao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Caibo","lastName":"Liao","id":"38236851800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0305-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0306-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0304-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6325128","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"abstract":"Performance analysis of coil launcher is very important for experimental research and electromagnetic optimization design. In order to check the effect of the improvement and analyze electromagnetic transient in coil launcher, the field coupling circuit simulation method is introduced in this paper. First the current of exciting coils was calculated by circuit model based on improved current filament method (CFM), and then the exciting current was loaded in 2D axisymmetric field model. The field model was built based on non-overlapping mortar finite element method (NO-MFEM). NO-MFEM divided the whole domain into two sub-domains, one contains the movable part(armature) and the other contains the source current(coils). The two sub-domains are discretized independently and the two set of meshes are non-conforming on the interface. When the movable part changes location, it only needs to change the node coordinates in movable sub-domains and information of mortar nodes and elements. In this paper performance analysis of three-stage coaxial induction coil launcher is carried out based on the field-circuit method. The correspondence of the results proves the validity of the field-circuit method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch

for railguns launching solid armatures. At the start stage of railgun launching with current ramp-up, the appearance of aluminum coating tends to be concentrated on the out sides of rails, which indicates current concentration on the edge of armature. In this paper, using finite element code ANSYS, numerical simulations of armature's current density distribution with rails of various resistivity and heights were conducted. The results show that: (1) current concentrates on edges of armature tail; (2) the current density on edge of armature tail can be reduced by increasing rail resistivity and/or decreasing rail height. In launch experiments in 20mm square caliber railgun, rail material having different resistivity, such as 98%Cu-1%Zr-1%Cr alloy, brass and non-magnetic steel are investigated. Different heights of rail such as 50mm and 30mm are investigated, too. The results show that higher resistivity and lower height of rails have comparatively lighter armature edge erosion at current ramp-up. Based on the work, improved rail structure is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/EML.2012.6325143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EML.2012.6325143","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6314417/6324992/06325143.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of rail resistivity and rail height on armature edge erosion at current ramp-up","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Influence of rail resistivity and rail height on armature edge erosion at current ramp-up","conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325143/","accessionNumber":"13059358","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325143/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of rail resistivity and rail height on armature edge erosion at current ramp-up","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"181chen2456313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033873S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6314417","isNumber":"6324992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6314417","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6324992","articleId":"6325143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6325171,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlai Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Chunlai","lastName":"Yu","id":"37878899600"},{"name":"Rengui Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Rengui","lastName":"Lu","id":"37694833000"},{"name":"Conghao Su","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Conghao","lastName":"Su","id":"38240997500"},{"name":"Chunbo Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Chunbo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37275480100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0305-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0306-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0304-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6325171","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Capacitors","Projectiles","Data communication","Resonant frequency","Wireless communication","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","magnetic field effects","projectiles","weapons","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-range projectile","compact wireless energy","data transmission device","remote projectile","coupled coil","data transfer","control circuit","energy transmission mode","external data","data encoding technology","high-frequency magnetic field","internal device","internal data","external receiver coil","data resonant frequency","energy transfer frequency","resonant circuit topology","internal capacitance","zero voltage switching mode"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on wireless energy and data transmission for long-range projectile","doi":"10.1109/EML.2012.6325171","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6314417/6324992/06325171.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6324992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EML.2012.6325171","abstract":"In this paper, a compact wireless energy and data transmission device which can be used on the remote projectile is described. This device uses magnetic field generated by the coupled coil to receive the energy and data and transfers the internal data. These functions above can be realized by operating the control circuit in different modes, which requires only one coil in the projectile. In energy transmission mode, energy can be transferred into the projectile wirelessly, as well as the external data by data encoding technology. High-frequency magnetic field is generated by internal device when the internal data is delivered to the external receiver coil. Interference between the energy and data transmission can be avoided by adjusting the data resonant frequency which is different from the energy transfer frequency by changing the resonant circuit topology and the internal capacitance. The device works at zero voltage switching mode, and produces lower loss, which is beneficial for improving the efficiency. The experiment results show that the device can transfer energy at 1MHz, and internal data at 500 kHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325171/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 May 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13059386","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6325171/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Study on wireless energy and data transmission for long-range projectile","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on wireless energy and data transmission for long-range projectile","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"280yu2397355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159316S","chronDate":"15-19 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6314417","isNumber":"6324992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6314417","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6324992","articleId":"6325171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6325182,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37598491700"},{"name":"David G.

The approximate inference is based on an improved canonical model for the messages of the Sum & Product Algorithm, and a method for clustering the messages using the directional statistics framework. The proposed canonical model includes treatment for phase slips which can limit the performance of tracking algorithms. We show simulation results and complexity analysis for the proposed algorithm demonstrating its superiority over some of the current state of the art algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Phase noise","Trajectory","Clustering algorithms","Parity check codes","Message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Bayes methods","graph theory","iterative decoding","parity check codes","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","LDPC","strong phase noise","message passing algorithm","approximate Bayesian inference","factor graph representation","code joint posterior","approximate inference","canonical model","sum & product algorithm","message clustering","directional statistics framework","phase slip treatment","complexity analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["phase noise","factor graph","Tikhonov","phase slip","directional statistics","moment matching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325187","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325187","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325187.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325187/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient iterative decoding of LDPC in the presence of strong phase noise","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13058803","htmlLink":"/document/6325187/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient iterative decoding of LDPC in the presence of strong phase noise","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p1shayovitz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039047S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6325191,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Ilnseher","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ilnseher","id":"37391642200"},{"name":"Frank Kienle","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Kienle","id":"37271663200"},{"name":"Christian Weis","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Weis","id":"38030541900"},{"name":"Norbert Wehn","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Wehn","id":"37271665700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325191","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":911},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","Turbo codes","Random access memory","Measurement","Computer architecture","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE advanced base station application","LTE standard","multiuser MIMO","iterative demodulation","cooperative multipoint reception","beam forming","high throughput target","communication performance","code rates","stringent latency requirement","LTE turbo code decoder","bit rate 2.15 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"The LTE standard [1], will soon be upgraded to LTE advanced, which will add new techniques like multi user MIMO using iterative demodulation, cooperative multi point reception (CoMP) and beam forming to increase the system throughput in the uplink of one cell.

The mechanism behind this spectacular performance is the threshold saturation phenomenon, which is characterized by the belief-propagation threshold of the spatially-coupled ensemble increasing to an intrinsic noise threshold defined by the uncoupled system. In this paper, we present a simple proof of threshold saturation that applies to a broad class of coupled scalar recursions. The conditions of the theorem are verified for the density-evolution (DE) equations of irregular LDPC codes on the BEC, a class of generalized LDPC codes, and the joint iterative decoding of LDPC codes on intersymbol-interference channels with erasure noise. Our approach is based on potential functions and was motivated mainly by the ideas of Takeuchi et al. The resulting proof is surprisingly simple when compared to previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325197","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325197.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple proof of threshold saturation for coupled scalar recursions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A simple proof of threshold saturation for coupled scalar recursions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325197/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13058813","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325197/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple proof of threshold saturation for coupled scalar recursions","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p51yedla.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119536S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-03"},{"_id":6325199,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Chinnici","affiliation":["PDU Microwave and Mobile Backhaul, Ericsson Telecomunicazioni S.p.A., Vimodrone, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Chinnici","id":"37684811600"},{"name":"Paolo Spallaccini","affiliation":["PDU Microwave and Mobile Backhaul, Ericsson Telecomunicazioni S.p.A., Vimodrone, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Spallaccini","id":"37891767500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325199","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325199","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Decoding","Turbo codes","Computational modeling","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","parallel architectures","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo codes simulation","bit error rates","conventional CPU","CPU-GPU coprocessing strategy","GPU parallel architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["turbo codes","GPU","SCCC"]}],"abstract":"Simulation of turbo codes with moderately long block lengths down to bit error rates of the order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n requires long runtimes on conventional CPUs.

The IS and the MC simulation results match up very well when both are available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325207/","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13058823","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6325207/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"NB-LDPC: Absorbing set and importance sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NB-LDPC: Absorbing set and importance sampling","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p101poloni.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051039S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6325209,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Dion","affiliation":["France Telecom, Orange Laboratories, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Dion","id":"38490070500"},{"name":"Marie-Helene Hamon","affiliation":["France Telecom, Orange Laboratories, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Helene","lastName":"Hamon","id":"37295794700"},{"name":"Pierre P\u00e9nard","affiliation":["France Telecom, Orange Laboratories, Cesson Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"P\u00e9nard","id":"37295796400"},{"name":"Matthieu Arzel","affiliation":["Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise-CS 83818, TELECOM Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Arzel","id":"37276347900"},{"name":"Michel Jezequel","affiliation":["Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise-CS 83818, TELECOM Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Jezequel","id":"37276349300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325209","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapted scheduling of QC-LDPC decoding for multistandard receivers","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325209.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325209","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Equations","Delay","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","iterative decoding","parity check codes","radio receivers","scheduling","telecommunication standards","trellis codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adapted scheduling","QC-LDPC decoding process","multistandard receivers","PLC standards","wireless standards","advanced FEC codes","turbo codes","multistandard devices","WiFi","mobile phones","FEC multistandard decoders","access memory","optimized trellis design","trellis decoding","iterative decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Architecture","FEC decoding","hardware implementation","iterative decoding","LDPC codes","turbo codes","parallelism","trellis decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325209","abstract":"Wireless and PLC standards have to cope with noisy channels.

Despite of intensive research in this field the Shannon limit was unachievable for a long time, but today iterative techniques can approach this limit. However, iterative decoding is computationally very demanding, especially for real time applications and/or high data rates. This encouraged researchers to look for alternatives, which led to the new field of analog decoding, meaning an implementation with analog circuits. The performance gain of those analog decoders compared to a digital implementation is believed to be at least a factor of 100 in terms of speed or power consumption. In this paper we focus on iterative threshold decoding. We show that this method can be considered as a dynamical system, which can be described by high order recurrent neural networks. Using this representation we give a qualitative description of the long term behavior of such a dynamical system. The continuous time high order recurrent neural networks can be understood as the basis for an analog implementation of iterative threshold decoding.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325210","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325210.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of high order recurrent neural networks for analog decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Neurons","Stability analysis","Recurrent neural networks","Mathematical model","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","error correction codes","forward error correction","iterative decoding","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog decoding","forward error correction coding","FEC","digital transmission","Shannon limit","iterative techniques","iterative decoding","analog circuits","analog decoders","power consumption","iterative threshold decoding","dynamical system","continuous time high order recurrent neural networks","analog implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative threshold decoding","high order recurrent neural networks","stability analysis","analog decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of high order recurrent neural networks for analog decoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13058826","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of high order recurrent neural networks for analog decoding","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p116mostafa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120103S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6325212,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Tong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Tong","id":"37415905400"},{"name":"Li Ping","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ping","id":"37279033100"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325212","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325212","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Concatenated codes","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","optimisation","precoding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated zigzag codes","CZ codes","multidimensional parallel concatenated codes","Shannon limit","precoding technique","turbo-like codes","EXIT chart tool","convergence analysis","performance optimization","code rates"]}],"abstract":"Concatenated zigzag (CZ) codes are a class of multidimensional parallel concatenated codes, which have some favorable properties, such as low encoding and decoding complexities and rate compatibility.

The EXIT chart tool is used for convergence analysis and performance optimization. We show that the proposed precoded CZ codes have thresholds within 0.25 dB of the Shannon limit for a wide code rate range of [0.5, 20/21].

Our approach views the processing within and collaboration between receivers as the solution to an inference problem in the probabilistic model of the whole system. The probabilistic model is formulated to explicitly incorporate the receivers' ability to share information of a predefined type. We employ a recently proposed unified message-passing tool to infer the variables of interest in the factor graph representation of the probabilistic model. The exchange of information between receivers arises in the form of passing messages along some specific edges of the factor graph; the rate of updating and passing these messages determines the amount of communication overhead associated with cooperation. Simulation results illustrate the high performance of the proposed algorithm even with a low number of message exchanges between receivers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Vectors","Probabilistic logic","Iterative decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","distributed algorithms","graph theory","iterative methods","message passing","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed iterative processing","interference channels","receiver cooperation","distributed iterative algorithm design","interference-limited wireless system","inference problem","probabilistic model","information sharing","unified message passing tool","factor graph representation","information exchange","graph edges","communication overhead"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325215","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325215.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed iterative processing for interference channels with receiver cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed iterative processing for interference channels with receiver cooperation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325215/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325215/","accessionNumber":"13058831","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed iterative processing for interference channels with receiver cooperation","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p140badiu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076259S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6325216,"authors":[{"name":"Dapeng Hao","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Dapeng","lastName":"Hao","id":"37646796900"},{"name":"Peter Adam Hoeher","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter Adam","lastName":"Hoeher","id":"37273574400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325216","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity tree search detection algorithm for superposition modulation","abstract":"We present a novel soft-output detection algorithm for superposition modulation.

The parity-check matrices of such codes usually have redundant rows. Equivalently, their Tanner graphs have redundant check nodes. Based on this property, we propose an adaptive decoding algorithm. In the adaptive decoding algorithm, all the check nodes are classified into active nodes and silent nodes according to certain criteria, and only active check nodes are involved in the iterative procession.

We propose a joint detection/decoding algorithm that works in an iterative manner by exchanging messages between the Viterbi detector and a generalized majority logic decoder (GMLGD). The Viterbi detector is implemented over a sectionalized trellis. The hard-decisions made by the Viterbi detector are then passed to the decoder. The decoder delivers as output estimates of each coded symbols, which will be utilized in next iteration to update the branch metrics of the trellis. Since the proposed algorithm requires only integer operations and finite field operations, it can be implemented with simple combinational logic circuits. Simulation results and complexity analysis show that, when compared with the conventional turbo equalizer implemented with the BCJR algorithm and the Q-ary sum-product algorithm (BCJR-QSPA), the proposed algorithm has a much lower complexity but suffers from a little performance degradation. So the proposed algorithm provides a good candidate for trade-offs between performance and complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative detection/decoding of majority-logic decodable nonbinary LDPC codes over partial response channels","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325227","startPage":"200","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325227.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Iterative detection/decoding of majority-logic decodable nonbinary LDPC codes over partial response channels","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325227/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13058843","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative detection/decoding of majority-logic decodable nonbinary LDPC codes over partial response channels","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p200zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126118S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6325229,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Schmalen","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Schmalen","id":"37397871100"},{"name":"Stephan ten Brink","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"ten Brink","id":"37272165200"},{"name":"Andreas Leven","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Leven","id":"37272597000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325229","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Decoding","Iterative decoding","Equalizers","Bit error rate","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","iterative decoding","optimisation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","iteration schedules","LDPC coded modulation","LDPC coded detection","iterative detection","low-density parity-check code","EXIT curves","bit error rate","channel quality"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider iterative detection in combination with an outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, and present new EXIT curves that help to optimize the decoding schedule among these blocks.

Careful encoder and decoder design is essential for reducing implementation complexity. When used in conjunction with iteratively-decodeable sparse graph codes, there is a choice to be made between the number of multiuser interference cancellation stages and the number of iterations used for decoding each user's code. Too few decoder iterations may increase the number of interference cancellation steps, whereas too many may superfluous, or even inhibit the convergence behaviour of the cancellation loop. In this paper we design non-systematic irregular repeat-accumulate codes for multiple-access channels where the number of cancellation stages and number of decoder iterations at each stage are fixed. The design goal is minimal bit error rate. Our formulation is based on extrinsic information transfer, and introduces the number of iterations directly into the curve fitting problem. For clear development of concepts, we restrict attention to the binary adder channel, where our approach is exact. Generalisation to other sparse graph codes and other multiple-access channels is straightforward, subject to the usual approximations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325230","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325230.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"219","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Irregular repeat accumulate codes with few iterations for the binary adder channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Irregular repeat accumulate codes with few iterations for the binary adder channel","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6325230/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13058846","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325230/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Irregular repeat accumulate codes with few iterations for the binary adder channel","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p215wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052402S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6325232,"authors":[{"name":"Najeeb ul Hassan","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Najeeb","lastName":"ul Hassan","id":"38232101600"},{"name":"Michael Lentmaier","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lentmaier","id":"37283339900"},{"name":"Gerhard P.

This makes MIMO systems with hundreds of antennas very attractive but one of the major problems that obstructs such large dimensional MIMO systems from the practical realization is a high complexity of the MIMO detector. We present in this paper the new soft output MIMO detector based on matched filtering that can be applied to the large MIMO systems which are coded by the powerful non-binary LDPC codes. The per-bit complexity of the proposed detector is just 0.28% to that of low complexity soft output MMSE detector and scales only linearly with a number of antennas. Furthermore, the coded performances with small information length 800 bits are within 4.2 dB from the associated MIMO capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325233","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325233.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Ultra low complexity soft output detector for non-binary LDPC coded large MIMO systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13058849","htmlLink":"/document/6325233/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra low complexity soft output detector for non-binary LDPC coded large MIMO systems","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p230suthisopapan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065758S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6325234,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Haddad","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom; Telecom Bretagne; UMR CNRS 3192 Lab-STICC, Electronics Department, Technop\u00f4le Brest Iroise CS, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Salim","lastName":"Haddad","id":"37709563400"},{"name":"Amer Baghdadi","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom; Telecom Bretagne; UMR CNRS 3192 Lab-STICC, Electronics Department, Technop\u00f4le Brest Iroise CS, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Amer","lastName":"Baghdadi","id":"37276706200"},{"name":"Michel Jezequel","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom; Telecom Bretagne; UMR CNRS 3192 Lab-STICC, Electronics Department, Technop\u00f4le Brest Iroise CS, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Jezequel","id":"37276349300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325234","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"abstract":"Robust, flexible, and high throughput are key features for future wireless Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) communication system implementations. Furthermore, iterative processing is being widely investigated and proposed nowadays to cope with the increasing transmission quality requirement. However, these advanced techniques pose a real challenge in terms of complexity. A typical example in this domain is the significant performance improvement offered by the use of turbo equalization with turbo decoding for applications where the propagation channel experiences multipath effects. For this iterative system, and targeting a reduced complexity MIMO turbo receiver with high error correction feature for different modulation schemes and code rates, we analyze the impact of the demapper taking into account the a priori information (turbo demodulation) on the MIMO system complexity. We demonstrate that the adoption of turbo demodulation in this context can lead to significant complexity reduction for specific system configurations. Simulations show that applying feedback to the demapper reduces the overall number of iterations (thus arithmetic operations and memory accesses) for all modulations schemes except for QPSK. This reduction in number of iterations is obtained along with lower error rate performances. Results show a complexity reduction which can reach 24.5% in arithmetic operations and 31.8% in write access memory for QAM16 modulation scheme with 4\u00d74 MIMO Spatial Multiplexing (SM) antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6310270/6325181/06325234.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2012.6325234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive complexity MIMO turbo receiver applying turbo demodulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","MIMO","Receivers","Iterative decoding","Modulation","Bit error rate","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","error statistics","feedback","MIMO communication","multipath channels","quadrature amplitude modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive complexity","MIMO turbo receiver","turbo demodulation","multiinput multioutput communication","iterative processing","transmission quality","turbo equalization","turbo decoding","propagation channel","multipath effect","error correction feature","modulation scheme","code rate","feedback","demapper","error rate performance","complexity reduction","write access memory","QAM16 modulation","MIMO spatial multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive complexity MIMO turbo receiver applying turbo demodulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325234/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13058850","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2012","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive complexity MIMO turbo receiver applying turbo demodulation","confLoc":"Gothenburg, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p235haddad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051038S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6310270","isNumber":"6325181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6310270","xplore-issue":"6325181","articleId":"6325234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6325235,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Nowak","affiliation":["Communication Technology Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37396426300"},{"name":"Ruediger Kays","affiliation":["Communication Technology Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Ruediger","lastName":"Kays","id":"37267615100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2115-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2114-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2113-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-4700"}],"articleNumber":"6325235","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Modulation","Reliability","Decoding","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Bit error rate","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation","optimisation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaver design","spectrally-efficient bit-interleaved LDPC-coded modulation","design methodology","bit-interleaved coded modulation systems","binary irregular low-density parity-check","higher-order modulation","unequal error protection characteristics","interleaver configuration","optimization procedure","mapping distributions","LDPC codes","IEEE standard 802.11n"]}],"abstract":"A design methodology for interleavers in bit-interleaved coded modulation systems deploying (binary irregular) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and higher-order modulation is presented.

Moreover, the multiple bonding wires are added to eliminate the parasitic capacitance of input stage (first) and to save the power dissipation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Simulation","Bluetooth","Impedance","Impedance matching","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","CMOS integrated circuits","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascode class F CMOS power amplifier","class 1 Bluetooth application","CMOS technology","cascode schematic","power added efficiency","PAE","parasitic capacitance","power dissipation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class F","power amplifier (PA)","Bluetooth","cascade"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASID.2012.6325305","publicationTitle":"Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification","displayPublicationTitle":"Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313472/6325276/06325305.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASID.2012.6325305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-stage cascode class F CMOS power amplifier for Bluetooth","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A two-stage cascode class F CMOS power amplifier for Bluetooth","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325305/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325305/","accessionNumber":"13060761","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-stage cascode class F CMOS power amplifier for Bluetooth","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00291569634337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055198S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313472","isNumber":"6325276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313472","xplore-issue":"6325276","articleId":"6325305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6325306,"authors":[{"name":"Weichen Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Weichen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538047700"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536599900"},{"name":"Fubing Mao","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fubing","lastName":"Mao","id":"38490007500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2145-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2144-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2143-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"CD","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2163-5048"}],"articleNumber":"6325306","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"abstract":"As transistor density continues to increase with the advent of nanotechnology, reliability issues raised by more frequently appeared soft errors are becoming critical tasks for future embedded multiprocessor systems design. State-of-the-art techniques for soft error protections targeting multiprocessor systems involve either high chip cost and area overhead or much performance degradation and energy consumption, and do not fulfill the increasing requirement of high performance and reliability. In this paper, we present a hardware-software collaborated approach to efficiently manage application execution and overcome reliability threats for Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoC). A hardware-based on-chip sensor network is built for soft error detection, and a software-based recovery mechanism is applied for soft error correction. This strategy only introduces trivial overhead on hardware design and much lower overhead on software control and execution, and hence performance degradation and energy consumption are greatly reduced. The hardware sensor design is verified via FPGA-based implementations, which proves the feasibility of the proposed approach. A SystemC-based cycle-accurate simulator is built to further verify the effectiveness of our technique by comparing with related techniques on several real-world applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313472/6325276/06325306.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification","doi":"10.1109/ICASID.2012.6325306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASID.2012.6325306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient soft error protection scheme for MPSoC and FPGA-based verification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Hardware","Energy consumption","Software","Registers","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft error protection","MPSoC","FPGA-based verification","transistor density","nanotechnology","reliability","embedded multiprocessor system","hardware-software collaborated approach","multiprocessor systems-on-chip","hardware-based on-chip sensor network","soft error detection","software-based recovery mechanism","soft error correction","hardware sensor design","SystemC-based cycle-accurate simulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An efficient soft error protection scheme for MPSoC and FPGA-based verification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6325306/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13060762","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient soft error protection scheme for MPSoC and FPGA-based verification","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00301569641562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06879S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313472","isNumber":"6325276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313472","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6325276","articleId":"6325306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6325308,"authors":[{"name":"Xian-zhong Guan","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xian-zhong","lastName":"Guan","id":"38243966500"},{"name":"Hong-hui Deng","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hong-hui","lastName":"Deng","id":"37530657100"},{"name":"Liang Chang","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chang","id":"38488856200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2145-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2144-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2143-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"CD","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2163-5048"}],"articleNumber":"6325308","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":745},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Switches","Simulation","Logic gates","Power demand","Transient analysis","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opamp-sharing MDAC design","pipelined ADC","multiplying digital-to-analog converter","analog-to-digital converter","SC-CMFB circuit","switch capacitor-common mode feedback circuit","gain-boost structure","amplifier","CMOS process","voltage 1.8 V","word length 14 bit","size 0.18 mum","power 10.5 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pipeline","opam-sharing","MDAC","SC-CMFB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325308","abstract":"A design of opamp-sharing multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) used in the successive stages of an 80MS/s 14-bit pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with 1.8V supply voltage is presented in this paper.

orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. For every transmitted symbol, PIC is first invoked to remove the multiple user interference (MUI). Thereafter, SIC is employed to successively alleviate the soft-decision outputs of inter-carrier interference (ICI). To fully mitigate the decision residues as well as the interference caused by the undetected symbols, an oblique projection based detector is devised. Furthermore, for practical implementations, a low-complexity version, which only copes with the principal components of ICI, is also addressed. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme outperforms the existing detection algorithms. Especially, the low-complexity implementation requires dramatically lower computational overhead with only slight performance loss.","doi":"10.1109/ICASID.2012.6325344","publicationTitle":"Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification","displayPublicationTitle":"Anti-counterfeiting, Security, and Identification","pdfPath":"/iel5/6313472/6325276/06325344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASID.2012.6325344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6325276","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oblique projection based receiver with interference cancellation in OFDMA uplink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6325344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Oblique projection based receiver with interference cancellation in OFDMA uplink","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6325344/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13060799","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6325344/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oblique projection based receiver with interference cancellation in OFDMA uplink","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00681569635417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046586S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6313472","isNumber":"6325276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6313472","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6325276","articleId":"6325344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6325353,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Hu","affiliation":["Software School, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Hu","id":"38489023300"},{"name":"Haishan Chen","affiliation":["Software School, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Haishan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600760100"},{"name":"Lu Huang","affiliation":["Software School, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Huang","id":"38489717700"},{"name":"Xiaodan Zhu","affiliation":["Software School, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38489958500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2145-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2144-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2143-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"CD","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2163-5048"}],"articleNumber":"6325353","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2377},"abstract":"Since 2007, the business calculation model-cloud computing was proposed.

The information will then be rendered on the display via augmented reality. In order to reduce the transmission cost, the mobile device is used to perform most of the image processing tasks, such as the preprocessing, resizing, corner detection, and augmented reality rendering.

An analytical optimization framework based on MultiAmdhal framework and Lagrange multipliers, for selecting the optimal set of accelerators and for allocating resources among them under constrained area is proposed. Due to the practical implementation of accelerators, the optimal architecture under area constraints may exclude some of the accelerators. As the fraction of the workload that can be accelerated decreases, resources (e.g. area) may shift from accelerators into the general purpose processor. The framework can be extended in a number of ways, spanning from SoC partitioning, bandwidth to power distribution, energy and other constrained resources.","doi":"10.1109/L-CA.2012.34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/L-CA.2012.34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/10208/6940436/06327178.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6940436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized MultiAmdahl: Optimization of Heterogeneous Multi-Accelerator SoC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-June 5 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Generalized MultiAmdahl: Optimization of Heterogeneous Multi-Accelerator SoC","volume":"13","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"5 Jan.-June 2014","accessionNumber":"14709864","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327178/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized MultiAmdahl: Optimization of Heterogeneous Multi-Accelerator SoC","sourcePdf":"13lca01-morad-34-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047032S","chronDate":"Jan.-June 5 2014","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"6940436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6940436","articleId":"6327178","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6327186,"authors":[{"name":"\u00c1lvaro V\u00e1zquez","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Tecnolox\u00edas da Informaci\u00f3n (CITIUS),, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6568861/6327186/6327186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00c1lvaro V\u00e1zquez received the graduate degree in physics in 1997 and the PhD degree in electronic and computer engineering in 2009 from the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

A sequential implementation of the algorithm is proposed and the execution times and hardware requirements are estimated for single and double-precision floating-point computations.

Our method centers upon the classical Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm where we represent the source and template/model in the complex 2D Fourier domain rather than in the spatial 2D domain. We refer to our approach as the Fourier LK (FLK) algorithm. The FLK formulation is advantageous when one preprocesses the source image and template/model with a bank of filters (e.g., oriented edges, Gabor, etc.) as 1) it can handle substantial illumination variations, 2) the inefficient preprocessing filter bank step can be subsumed within the FLK algorithm as a sparse diagonal weighting matrix, 3) unlike traditional LK, the computational cost is invariant to the number of filters and as a result is far more efficient, and 4) this approach can be extended to the Inverse Compositional (IC) form of the LK algorithm where nearly all steps (including Fourier transform and filter bank preprocessing) can be precomputed, leading to an extremely efficient and robust approach to gradient descent image matching. Further, these computational savings translate to nonrigid object alignment tasks that are considered extensions of the LK algorithm, such as those found in Active Appearance Models (AAMs).","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6504892/06327194.pdf","startPage":"1383","endPage":"1396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier Lucas-Kanade Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327194/","displayDocTitle":"Fourier Lucas-Kanade Algorithm","volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","pubMedId":"23599053","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327194/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier Lucas-Kanade Algorithm","sourcePdf":"ttp2013061383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114615S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6504892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6504892","articleId":"6327194","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6327210,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Grottel","affiliation":["Computer Graphics and Visualization Laboratory, Technical University of Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Grottel","id":"37590934100"},{"name":"Philipp Beck","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical and Applied Physics, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Beck","id":"38489110000"},{"name":"Christoph M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"37303115200"},{"name":"Guido Reina","affiliation":["Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Reina","id":"37287276500"},{"name":"Johannes Roth","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical and Applied Physics, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Roth","id":"38489822300"},{"name":"Hans-Rainer Trebin","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical and Applied Physics, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Rainer","lastName":"Trebin","id":"38490641500"},{"name":"Thomas Ertl","affiliation":["Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ertl","id":"37268023800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6327210","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":597},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Metal oxides are important for many technical applications. For example alumina (aluminum oxide) is the most commonly-used ceramic in microelectronic devices thanks to its excellent properties. Experimental studies of these materials are increasingly supplemented with computer simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can reproduce the material behavior very well and are now reaching time scales relevant for interesting processes like crack propagation. In this work we focus on the visualization of induced electric dipole moments on oxygen atoms in crack propagation simulations. The straightforward visualization using glyphs for the individual atoms, simple shapes like spheres or arrows, is insufficient for providing information about the data set as a whole. As our contribution we show for the first time that fractional anisotropy values computed from the local neighborhood of individual atoms of MD simulation data depict important information about relevant properties of the field of induced electric dipole moments. Iso surfaces in the field of fractional anisotropy as well as adjustments of the glyph representation allow the user to identify regions of correlated orientation. We present novel and relevant findings for the application domain resulting from these visualizations, like the influence of mechanical forces on the electrostatic properties.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer

We attempt to generate plausible and realistic looking volumetric visualizations via a tomographic approach that exploits the spherical or axial symmetry prevalent in some relevant types of nebulae. Different types of symmetry can be implemented by using different randomized distributions of virtual cameras. Our approach is based on an iterative compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm that we extend with support for position-dependent volumetric regularization and linear equality constraints. We present a distributed multi-GPU implementation that is capable of reconstructing high-resolution datasets from arbitrary projections. Its robustness and scalability are demonstrated for astronomical imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting volumetric data is visualized using direct volume rendering. Compared to previous approaches, our method preserves a much higher amount of detail and visual variety in the 3D visualization, especially for objects with only approximate symmetry.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6327196/06327223.pdf","startPage":"2188","endPage":"2197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualization of Astronomical Nebulae via Distributed Multi-GPU Compressed Sensing Tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327223/","displayDocTitle":"Visualization of Astronomical Nebulae via Distributed Multi-GPU Compressed Sensing Tomography","volume":"18","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038332","pubMedId":"26357126","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327223/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualization of Astronomical Nebulae via Distributed Multi-GPU Compressed Sensing Tomography","sourcePdf":"ttg2012122188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165111S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6327196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6327196","articleId":"6327223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327237,"authors":[{"name":"Blake Nelson","affiliation":["School of Computing and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Blake","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37557887400"},{"name":"Eric Liu","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Liu","id":"38490364600"},{"name":"Robert M.

This system is designed to minimize visualization errors of these types of fields by querying the underlying finite element basis functions (e.g., high-order polynomials) directly, leading to pixel-exact representations of solutions and geometry. The system interacts with simulation data through runtime plugins, which only require users to implement a handful of operations fundamental to finite element solvers. The data in turn can be visualized through the use of cut surfaces, contours, isosurfaces, and volume rendering. These visualization algorithms are implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX GPU-based ray-tracing engine, which provides accelerated ray traversal of the high-order geometry, and CUDA, which allows for effective parallel evaluation of the visualization algorithms. The direct interface between ElVis and the underlying data differentiates it from existing visualization tools. Current tools assume the underlying data is composed of linear primitives; high-order data must be interpolated with linear functions as a result. In this work, examples drawn from aerodynamic simulations-high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element solutions of aerodynamic flows in particular-will demonstrate the superiority of ElVis' pixel-exact approach when compared with traditional linear-interpolation methods. Such methods can introduce a number of inaccuracies in the resulting visualization, making it unclear if visual artifacts are genuine to the solution data or if these artifacts are the result of interpolation errors. Linear methods additionally cannot properly visualize curved geometries (elements or boundaries) which can greatly inhibit developers' debugging efforts. As we will show, pixel-exact visualization exhibits none of these issues, removing the visualization scheme as a source of uncertainty for engineers using ElVis.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6327196/06327237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327196","startPage":"2325","endPage":"2334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ElVis: A System for the Accurate and Interactive Visualization of High-Order Finite Element Solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ElVis: A System for the Accurate and Interactive Visualization of High-Order Finite Element Solutions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038346","pubMedId":"26357140","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ElVis: A System for the Accurate and Interactive Visualization of High-Order Finite Element Solutions","sourcePdf":"ttg2012122325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102918S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6327196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6327196","articleId":"6327237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327248,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Sedlmair","affiliation":["University of British, Colombia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Sedlmair","id":"37590945600"},{"name":"Miriah Meyer","affiliation":["University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Miriah","lastName":"Meyer","id":"37564728700"},{"name":"Tamara Munzner","affiliation":["University of British, Colombia"],"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Munzner","id":"37349490300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6327248","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":290,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6111},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327248","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Collaboration","Design methodology","Visualization","Algorithm design and analysis","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design study methodology","problem-driven visualization","visualization design guideline","task clarity axis","information location axis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design study","methodology","visualization","framework"]}],"abstract":"Design studies are an increasingly popular form of problem-driven visualization research, yet there is little guidance available about how to do them effectively.

Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey of related methodological approaches that involve a significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded theory, and action research.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.213","startPage":"2431","endPage":"2440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6327196/06327248.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Study Methodology: Reflections from the Trenches and the Stacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design Study Methodology: Reflections from the Trenches and the Stacks","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13038357","pubMedId":"26357151","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327248/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Study Methodology: Reflections from the Trenches and the Stacks","sourcePdf":"ttg2012122431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163866S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6327196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"290","xplore-issue":"6327196","articleId":"6327248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6327251,"authors":[{"name":"Kasper Dinkla","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kasper","lastName":"Dinkla","id":"38489573400"},{"name":"Michel A.

These directed networks have strong structural characteristics: out-degrees with a scale-free distribution, in-degrees bound by a low maximum, and few and small cycles. Standard visualization techniques, such as node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, are impeded by these network characteristics. The scale-free distribution of out-degrees causes a high number of intersecting edges in node-link diagrams. Adjacency matrices become space-inefficient due to the low in-degrees and the resulting sparse network. Compressed adjacency matrices, however, exploit these structural characteristics. By cutting open and rearranging an adjacency matrix, we achieve a compact and neatly-arranged visualization. Compressed adjacency matrices allow for easy detection of subnetworks with a specific structure, so-called motifs, which provide important knowledge about gene regulatory networks to domain experts. We summarize motifs commonly referred to in the literature, and relate them to network analysis tasks common to the visualization domain. We show that a user can easily find the important motifs in compressed adjacency matrices, and that this is hard in standard adjacency matrix and node-link diagrams. We also demonstrate that interaction techniques for standard adjacency matrices can be used for our compressed variant. These techniques include rearrangement clustering, highlighting, and filtering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327251/","volume":"18","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"13038360","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"26357154","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Adjacency Matrices: Untangling Gene Regulatory Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Adjacency Matrices: Untangling Gene Regulatory Networks","sourcePdf":"ttg2012122457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125115S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6327196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"34","articleId":"6327251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327255,"authors":[{"name":"Alan M.

Second, concepts from visual semiotics are applied to characterize the kind of visual signification that is appropriate for representing those different categories of uncertainty. This framework guided the two experiments reported here. The first addresses representation intuitiveness, considering both visual variables and iconicity of representation. The second addresses relative performance of the most intuitive abstract and iconic representations of uncertainty on a map reading task. Combined results suggest initial guidelines for representing uncertainty and discussion focuses on practical applicability of results.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6327196/06327255.pdf","startPage":"2496","endPage":"2505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Semiotics & Uncertainty Visualization: An Empirical Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327255/","displayDocTitle":"Visual Semiotics & Uncertainty Visualization: An Empirical Study","volume":"18","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038364","pubMedId":"26357158","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327255/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Semiotics & Uncertainty Visualization: An Empirical Study","sourcePdf":"ttg2012122496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088931S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6327196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"6327196","articleId":"6327255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6327271,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Cao","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Cao","id":"37604309600"},{"name":"Yu-Ru Lin","affiliation":["Northeastern University and Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Yu-Ru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37598450200"},{"name":"Xiaohua Sun","affiliation":["TongJi University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Sun","id":"38488930200"},{"name":"David Lazer","affiliation":["Northeastern University and Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lazer","id":"38489726300"},{"name":"Shixia Liu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Shixia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406039100"},{"name":"Huamin Qu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Huamin","lastName":"Qu","id":"37272637300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6327271","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2085},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media","Monitoring","Real-time systems","Diffusion processes","Twitter","Social network services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data visualisation","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Whisper","spatiotemporal process","information diffusion","social media","Twitter","visualization design","temporal trend","social-spatial extent","sunflower metaphor","spatial hierarchical layout","flux line-drawing algorithm","temporal pattern","spatial pattern","focused diffusion series"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information visualization","information diffusion","contagion","Social media","microblogging","spatiotemporal patterns"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Graphics","Information Dissemination","Software","Spatio-Temporal Analysis","User-Computer Interface"]}],"abstract":"When and where is an idea dispersed? Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, \u201cWhisper\u201d, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters. Initial feedback from domain experts suggests promising use for today's information consumption and dispersion in the wild.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6327196/06327271.pdf","startPage":"2649","endPage":"2658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whisper: Tracing the Spatiotemporal Process of Information Diffusion in Real Time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327271/","displayDocTitle":"Whisper: Tracing the Spatiotemporal Process of Information Diffusion in Real Time","volume":"18","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038380","pubMedId":"26357174","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whisper: Tracing the Spatiotemporal Process of Information Diffusion in Real Time","sourcePdf":"ttg2012122649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06508S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6327196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"83","articleId":"6327271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327274,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzuru Tanahashi","affiliation":["ViDi Research Group, University of California,\uc2a0Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Yuzuru","lastName":"Tanahashi","id":"37843956600"},{"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","affiliation":["ViDi Research Group, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Kwan-Liu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37275869400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6327274","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2036},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Data visualization","Genomics","Design methodology","White spaces","Motion pictures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","evolutionary computation","humanities","interactive systems","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design considerations","storyline visualization optimization","social interactions","hand-drawn illustration","XKCD","movie narrative charts","global trends","local interactions","storyline visualization automation","evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Layout algorithm","timeline visualization","storyline visualization","design study"]}],"abstract":"Storyline visualization is a technique used to depict the temporal dynamics of social interactions.

In parallel, there have been rapid advances in many facets of interaction technologies. However, InfoVis interactions have yet to take full advantage of these new possibilities in interaction technologies, as they largely still employ the traditional desktop, mouse, and keyboard setup of WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, and a Pointer) interfaces.

We discuss and relate general HCI interaction models to existing InfoVis interaction classifications by looking at interactions from a novel angle, taking into account the entire spectrum of interactions.

To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries.

Classification through machine learning has the potential to improve search and filter tasks encompassing either complex or very specific information needs, individually. Unfortunately, analysts who are knowledgeable in their field are typically not machine learning specialists. Most classification methods, however, require a certain expertise regarding their parametrization to achieve good results. Supervised machine learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data, which can be provided by analysts. However, the effort for labeling can be very high, which shifts the problem from composing complex queries or defining accurate filters to another laborious task, in addition to the need for judging the trained classifier's quality. We therefore compare three approaches for interactive classifier training in a user study. All of the approaches are potential candidates for the integration into a larger retrieval system. They incorporate active learning to various degrees in order to reduce the labeling effort as well as to increase effectiveness. Two of them encompass interactive visualization for letting users explore the status of the classifier in context of the labeled documents, as well as for judging the quality of the classifier in iterative feedback loops. We see our work as a step towards introducing user controlled classification methods in addition to text search and filtering for increasing recall in analytics scenarios involving large corpora.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6327196/06327290.pdf","startPage":"2839","endPage":"2848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Classifier Training for Text Document Retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Visual Classifier Training for Text Document Retrieval","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038399","pubMedId":"26357193","htmlLink":"/document/6327290/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Classifier Training for Text Document Retrieval","sourcePdf":"ttg2012122839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102726S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6327196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6327196","articleId":"6327290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6327297,"authors":[{"name":"Margit Pohl","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Margit","lastName":"Pohl","id":"37560816000"},{"name":"Michael Smuc","affiliation":["Danube-University of Krems, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Smuc","id":"37646291700"},{"name":"Eva Mayr","affiliation":["Danube-University of Krems, Austria"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Mayr","id":"37624360500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"6327297","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":959},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognition","Human factors","Visual analytics","Psychology","Problem-solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","data visualisation","human computer interaction","psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user puzzle","visual analytics systems","human reasoning","HCI","psychology","analytical procedures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive theory","visual knowledge discovery","interaction design","reasoning","problem solving"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cognition","Computer Graphics","Humans","Models, Psychological","User-Computer Interface","Visual Perception"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327297","abstract":"Visual analytics emphasizes the interplay between visualization, analytical procedures performed by computers and human perceptual and cognitive activities.

The standard approach is to convert the problems into the form of semi-definite programming (SDP) with the aid of rank relaxation and later employ randomization techniques for solution search. However, in many cases, this approach brings solutions that are far from the optimal ones. We consider the problem of minimizing the total power transmitted by the antenna array subject to quality-of-service (QoS) at the secondary receivers and interference constraints at the primary receivers. It is shown that this problem, which is known to be nonconvex NP-hard, can be approximated by a convex second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Then, an iterative algorithm in which the SOCP approximation is successively improved is presented. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of total transmitted power and feasibility, together with a reduced computational complexity, as compared to the existing ones, for both the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) cases. It is further shown that the proposed approach can be used to address the max-min fairness (MMF) based beamforming problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148985","htmlLink":"/document/6327308/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Beamforming in Cognitive Radio Multicast Transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Beamforming in Cognitive Radio Multicast Transmission","sourcePdf":"4108-tw1211-beko.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119143S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6327308","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6327309,"authors":[{"name":"Pin-Hsun Lin","affiliation":["Smart Wireless Laboratory Wireless Network Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan","Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6327309/6327309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pin-Hsun Lin (M'10) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2000 and 2010, respectively.

In this case, the secondary transmitter must satisfy a coexistence constraint which requires that no rate degradation occurs at the primary user (PU), even when the latter utilizes only a single-user decoder. To achieve a non-zero rate of the secondary user (SU) under this constraint, Jovicic and Viswanath previously proposed a scheme (referred to as the JV scheme) that utilizes relaying by the secondary transmitter to overcome the interference caused by the simultaneous transmission of the SU's message. In this case, the interference caused by the signals corresponding to PU's message at the secondary receiver (from both the direct and the relay links) is mitigated by employing dirty paper coding (DPC) at the secondary transmitter. However, the interference caused by the SU's message at the primary receiver is not eliminated in this case and, thus, will limit the power (and, hence, the rate) that can be used by the secondary transmitter to transmit its own message. In our work, the use of clean relaying by the secondary transmitter and/or receiver (i.e., relaying without simultaneous transmission of SU's own message) is proposed to improve the quality of the relayed signal and, thereby, increases the rate achievable by the SU. Two improved transmission schemes are proposed: (i) clean relaying by secondary transmitter (CT) and (ii) clean relaying by secondary transmitter and receiver (CTR). The CT scheme utilizes DPC to mitigate interference at the secondary receiver whereas the CTR scheme utilizes coding for multiple access channels with common messages to enable decoding of both PU's and SU's messages at the secondary receiver. The CT scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the JV scheme and, therefore, performs at least as well as the latter. The CTR scheme, on the other hand, is shown to outperform the CT scheme in terms of the multiplexing gain achievable under full channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and in terms of the rate achievable with statistical CSIT. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate these advantages.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.092712.120005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361508","startPage":"4058","endPage":"4073","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6361508/06327309.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Transmission Strategies for Cognitive Radio Under the Coexistence Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327309/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Transmission Strategies for Cognitive Radio Under the Coexistence Constraint","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148986","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Transmission Strategies for Cognitive Radio Under the Coexistence Constraint","sourcePdf":"4058-tw1211-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093849S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6361508","articleId":"6327309","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327311,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Rosas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6327311/6327311-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fernando Rosas studied Mathematics at the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, and graduated receiving the Academic Excellence Award (BSc Hons. 2007).

Nevertheless, the literature provides some evidence that low-order modulations are suboptimal for short transmission distances. No complete analysis on how the modulation size and transmission power must be chosen in order to achieve energy-efficient communications over fading channels has been reported so far. In this paper we provide this analysis by presenting a model that determines the energy consumed per payload bit transferred without error over fading channels of various statistics. We find that each modulation scheme has a single optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which the energy consumption is minimized. The optimal SNR and the minimal energy consumption are larger for channels with less favorable error statistics. We also find that, if each modulations is operated at its optimal SNR, BPSK and QPSK are the optimal choices for long transmission distances, but as the transmission distance shortens the optimal modulation size grows to 16-QAM and even to 64-QAM. This result leads to showing that for short-range communications the lifetime of a typical low-power transceiver can be up to 500% longer by selecting the optimal constellation instead of BPSK.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.100112.111275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06327311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.100112.111275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","startPage":"4286","endPage":"4295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation and SNR Optimization for Achieving Energy-Efficient Communications over Short-Range Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modulation and SNR Optimization for Achieving Energy-Efficient Communications over Short-Range Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188225","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327311/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation and SNR Optimization for Achieving Energy-Efficient Communications over Short-Range Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"4286-tw1212-rosas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072978S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6327311","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6327315,"authors":[{"name":"Sami M.

In this paper, we consider the problem of joint spectrum-sensing-duration design and power control in a point-to-point CR link. The objective of the proposed solution is to maximize the CR achievable throughput while keeping the CR interference to the primary user (PU) at or below a preset interference threshold. The joint spectrum-sensing design and power control is a non-convex optimization problem, hence, obtaining the optimal solution may not be always feasible. In this paper, we formulate the joint sensing-duration design and power control problem as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse. Afterward, we derive the formulas for the achievable throughput as a function of the sensing duration. Moreover, we investigate the effect of different levels of knowledge of the interference channel state information (CSI) on the achievable throughput and the optimal sensing duration.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.100112.111894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","startPage":"4372","endPage":"4380","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06327315.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Spectrum-Sensing Design and Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Stochastic Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327315/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Spectrum-Sensing Design and Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Stochastic Approach","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188227","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Spectrum-Sensing Design and Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Stochastic Approach","sourcePdf":"4372-tw1212-alma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071845S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6327315","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327316,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Mroueh","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Electronique de Paris, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6327316/6327316-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lina Mroueh received her engineering degree from Telecom ParisTech former Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9lecommunications (ENST) Paris in 2006, her MSc degree from university of Pierre and Marie Curie in 2006 and her PhD from Telecom ParisTech in 2010.

In this paper, a Bayesian framework and its particle filtering (PF) implementation for DOA tracking in the presence of complex symmetric alpha-stable noise process are developed. A constant velocity model is employed to model the source dynamics, and spatial spectra are exploited to formulate a pseudo likelihood of particles. Since the second-order statistics of alpha-stable processes do not exist, the fractional lower order moment matrix of the received data is used to replace the covariance matrix in calculating the spatial spectra. The noise usually spreads and distorts the mainlobe of the likelihood function and the particles cannot be weighted accurately. Hence, the likelihood function is exponentially weighted to emphasize the particles in a high likelihood area and thus enhance the resampling efficiency. The performance of the proposed tracking algorithm is extensively studied under simulated alpha-stable noise environments. The results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing PF tracking approach and the traditional localization approaches in DOA estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327326/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219990","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Particle Filtering for Acoustic Source Tracking in Impulsive Noise With Alpha-Stable Process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Filtering for Acoustic Source Tracking in Impulsive Noise With Alpha-Stable Process","sourcePdf":"jsen-zhong-2223209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177095S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6409978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6409978","articleId":"6327326","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6327328,"authors":[{"name":"Emma Lazzeri","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Emma","lastName":"Lazzeri","id":"37596217300"},{"name":"Antonio Malacarne","affiliation":["Interuniversity Consortium for Telecommunications, National Photonic Network Laboratory, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Malacarne","id":"37297032400"},{"name":"Giovanni Serafino","affiliation":["TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Serafino","id":"37585733000"},{"name":"Antonella Bogoni","affiliation":["Interuniversity Consortium for Telecommunications, National Photonic Network Laboratory, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonella","lastName":"Bogoni","id":"37270979100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6327328","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical waveguides","Quadrature phase shift keying","Logic gates","Optical noise","Bit error rate","Encoding","Lithium niobate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-optical processing","coding","error detection","periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide","quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)","XOR"]}],"abstract":"An all-optical scheme based on periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide for signal processing of the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of an input quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal is presented.

The DoF of the multipath channels on the transmit (Tx) side is derived by means of the spherical-wave expansion of electromagnetic fields radiated from a Tx antenna array having a certain aperture size. The DoF estimates are independent of particular realization of antenna elements on the Tx aperture. For a given aperture size, the DoF provides the number of the Tx antenna elements for efficient improvement of the system performance by utilizing the spatial diversity. Having confirmed the soundness of our DoF estimation method by channel measurements in an anechoic chamber, the DoF of indoor multipath channels is analyzed. The DoF on the Tx side of the considered multipath channels reveals larger values when the antenna aperture size is increased at a fixed frequency, and when the frequency increases for a fixed antenna aperture size. For a fixed frequency, increasing the antenna aperture size is more effective in observing extra DoF in the obstructed and non-line-of-sight channels than in the line-of-sight channels. Furthermore, for a fixed antenna aperture size, the use of the higher frequency brings larger DoFs in many propagation scenarios. The results also show that electrically smaller antennas are more efficient in observing the DoF. Finally, the solid angle of multipath is derived as a Tx antenna-independent metric of the multipath richness. It is defined as an angular range of dominant multipath clusters subtended on a unit sphere. Our analysis method is extendable to the multiple-input multiple-output regime in a straightforward manner.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327339/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13287798","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measurement-Based Analysis of Spatial Degrees of Freedom in Multipath Propagation Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement-Based Analysis of Spatial Degrees of Freedom in Multipath Propagation Channels","sourcePdf":"tap-haneda-2223431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095961S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6423915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6423915","articleId":"6327339","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6327340,"authors":[{"name":"Farnaz Karimdady Sharifabad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6423915/6327340/6327340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farnaz Karimdady Sharifabad (S'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran and the M.S. degree in wireless communications from the Lund University, Lund, Sweden, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","She is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Brigham Young University (BYU), Provo, UT, where her research mainly focuses on covariance modeling for multipath propagation channels and multi-antenna signal processing."]},"firstName":"Farnaz Karimdady","lastName":"Sharifabad","id":"38507673500"},{"name":"Michael A.

In this paper, we propose a scheme for detecting global anomalies in which a likelihood ratio test-based decision rule is applied in conjunction with automated data-driven estimation of the background probability density function (PDF). Specifically, the use of both semiparametric (finite mixtures) and nonparametric (Parzen windows) models is investigated for background PDF estimation. Although such approaches are well known in multivariate data analysis, they have been very seldom applied to estimate the hyperspectral image background PDF, mostly due to the difficulty of reliably learning the model parameters without operator intervention. In this paper, semi and nonparametric estimators have been successfully employed to estimate the image background PDF with the aim of detecting global anomalies in a scene benefiting from the application of ad hoc Bayesian learning strategies. Two real hyperspectral images have been used to experimentally evaluate the ability of the proposed AD scheme resulting from the application of different global background PDF models and learning methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2214392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6504776/06327353.pdf","startPage":"2837","endPage":"2852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2214392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Models and Methods for Automated Background Density Estimation in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327353/","displayDocTitle":"Models and Methods for Automated Background Density Estimation in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models and Methods for Automated Background Density Estimation in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","sourcePdf":"tgrs-veracini-2214392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059209S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"6504776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"40","articleId":"6327353","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6327355,"authors":[{"name":"Brendan F.

The recognition accuracies of six different face recognition algorithms (three commercial, two nontrainable, and one trainable) are computed on a large scale gallery that is partitioned so that each partition consists entirely of specific demographic cohorts. Eight total cohorts are isolated based on gender (male and female), race/ethnicity (Black, White, and Hispanic), and age group (18-30, 30-50, and 50-70 years old). Experimental results demonstrate that both commercial and the nontrainable algorithms consistently have lower matching accuracies on the same cohorts (females, Blacks, and age group 18-30) than the remaining cohorts within their demographic. Additional experiments investigate the impact of the demographic distribution in the training set on the performance of a trainable face recognition algorithm. We show that the matching accuracy for race/ethnicity and age cohorts can be improved by training exclusively on that specific cohort. Operationally, this leads to a scenario, called dynamic face matcher selection, where multiple face recognition algorithms (each trained on different demographic cohorts) are available for a biometric system operator to select based on the demographic information extracted from a probe image. This procedure should lead to improved face recognition accuracy in many intelligence and law enforcement face recognition scenarios. Finally, we show that an alternative to dynamic face matcher selection is to train face recognition algorithms on datasets that are evenly distributed across demographics, as this approach offers consistently high accuracy across all cohorts.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2214212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2214212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6342844/06327355.pdf","startPage":"1789","endPage":"1801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Performance: Role of Demographic Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Performance: Role of Demographic Information","volume":"7","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327355/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136038","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327355/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Performance: Role of Demographic Information","sourcePdf":"tifs-klare-2214212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073321S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6342844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6342844","articleId":"6327355","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6327356,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Liang An","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6409420/6327356/6327356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shao-Liang An was born in Xi'an, China, in 1983.

The simulation and experimental results verify that the DSVPWMx strategies are right and feasible.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2223221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6409420/06327356.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2223221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on the Novel Generalized Discontinuous SVPWM Strategies for Three-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study on the Novel Generalized Discontinuous SVPWM Strategies for Three-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327356/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13220113","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on the Novel Generalized Discontinuous SVPWM Strategies for Three-Phase Voltage Source Inverters","sourcePdf":"tii-an-2223221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085747S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6409420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6409420","articleId":"6327356","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6327357,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Panagi","affiliation":["KIOS Research Center for Intelligent Systems and Networks, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6387656/6327357/6327357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Panagiotis Panagi received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2006.

one of the most basic photo manipulation processes, photo cropping is widely used in the printing, graphic design, and photography industries. In this paper, we introduce graphlets (i.e., small connected subgraphs) to represent a photo's aesthetic features, and propose a probabilistic model to transfer aesthetic features from the training photo onto the cropped photo. In particular, by segmenting each photo into a set of regions, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) to represent the global aesthetic feature of each photo. Graphlets are then extracted from the RAGs, and these graphlets capture the local aesthetic features of the photos. Finally, we cast photo cropping as a candidate-searching procedure on the basis of a probabilistic model, and infer the parameters of the cropped photos using Gibbs sampling. The proposed method is fully automatic. Subjective evaluations have shown that it is preferred over a number of existing approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219184","pubMedId":"23070305","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Graphlet Transfer for Photo Cropping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Graphlet Transfer for Photo Cropping","sourcePdf":"tip-song-2223226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095287S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6407512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"123","articleId":"6327366","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327372,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Manh La","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6479286/6327372/6327372-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hung Manh La received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Thai Nguyen University of Technology, Thai Nguyen, Vietnam, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, in 2011.","He is a Research Associate with the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation (CAIT), Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, and a Lecturer with the Department of Electronics Engineering, Thai Nguyen University of Technology, Thai Nguyen.

We develop a novel method for multiple mobile sensor nodes to build this map using noisy sensor measurements. Our method consists of two parts. First, we develop a distributed sensor fusion algorithm by integrating two different distributed consensus filters to achieve cooperative sensing among sensor nodes. This fusion algorithm has two phases. In the first phase, the weighted average consensus filter is developed, which allows each sensor node to find an estimate of the value of the scalar field at each time step. In the second phase, the average consensus filter is used to allow each sensor node to find a confidence of the estimate at each time step. The final estimate of the value of the scalar field is iteratively updated during the movement of the mobile sensors via weighted average. Second, we develop the distributed flocking-control algorithm to drive the mobile sensors to form a network and track the virtual leader moving along the field when only a small subset of the mobile sensors know the information of the leader. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate our proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2215919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6479286/06327372.pdf","startPage":"766","endPage":"778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2215919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Sensor Fusion for Scalar Field Mapping Using Mobile Sensor Networks","volume":"43","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327372/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13383977","pubMedId":"23070310","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327372/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Sensor Fusion for Scalar Field Mapping Using Mobile Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-la-2215919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084507S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6479286","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6479286","articleId":"6327372","onlineDate":"07 March 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6327374,"authors":[{"name":"Ankur Agrawal","affiliation":["IBM Research Division, T.

The new signaling, called coded differential (CD), maps two bits of information to four wires and, therefore, has the same pin-efficiency as differential signaling. The coding scheme is designed in such a way that the parallel interface preserves many of the attractive properties of a differential link such as low supply noise generation and immunity to common-mode noise. The CD receiver also incorporates differential detection with no need for a dc reference. In addition, the coding completely eliminates the first post-cursor intersymbol interference of the channel over the entire unit-interval at no loss in throughput. As a result, CD leads to substantial increase in timing margin compared with a differential link with 1-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE). Unlike DFE, CD does not require channel tap estimation. The theory of CD signaling, the optimization of the encoder and the decoder, and the implementation details of a prototype system developed based on this scheme for graphics memory interfaces are described. The full-featured interface, implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, transfers 8 \u00d7 16 Gb/s data over 16 wires and achieves an energy efficiency of 4.1 pJ/b. Eye diagram measurements on a scope indicate 30% improvement in timing margin compared with a 1-tap predictive DFE system.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2012.2216413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2012.2216413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6392234/06327375.pdf","startPage":"3208","endPage":"3219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4.1-pJ/b, 16-Gb/s Coded Differential Bidirectional Parallel Electrical Link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"A 4.1-pJ/b, 16-Gb/s Coded Differential Bidirectional Parallel Electrical Link","volume":"47","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13188509","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4.1-pJ/b, 16-Gb/s Coded Differential Bidirectional Parallel Electrical Link","sourcePdf":"jssc-amirkhan-2216413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083064S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6392234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6392234","articleId":"6327375","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6327376,"authors":[{"name":"Delong Cui","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6392234/6327376/6327376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Delong Cui received B.S. and M.S. degree in physics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1988 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, in 2001.","He was a Senior Analog Mixed-Signal Designer with Teradyne Inc., Agoura Hills, CA, from 2002 to 2005, engaged in work on high speed drivers, comparators and data converters.

We present a method to help users in formulating complex SPARQL queries across multiple heterogeneous data sources. Even if the structure and vocabulary of the data sources are unknown to the user, the user is able to quickly and easily formulate his queries.

That is, the upper frequency of the transmitted signal is bounded by the attenuation of highfrequency ultrasound, especially when the penetration depth is large. In this case, only the band-limited signals are suitable for far-field detection. Fortunately, theoretical analysis in this paper shows that narrowband detection has greater potential for obtaining high range resolution compared with broadband detection. However, it is difficult to fully utilize this potential because of the severe overlap of narrowband echoes. As a result, we propose a novel approach for separating highly overlapping narrowband echoes in this paper to improve the resolution of range imaging. In our approach, in addition to a formulation following the emerging theory of sparse representation and compressed sensing, singular value decomposition is also employed to capture the main features of the signals, making this approach robust to moderate signal distortions. Numerous simulations and experiments on real data show that the proposed approach is able to fully utilize the potential of narrowband detection and outperforms other competitive methods in terms of stability and accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6327478/06327495.pdf","startPage":"2237","endPage":"2253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327478","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrowband Ultrasonic Detection with High Range Resolution: Separating Echoes via Compressed Sensing and Singular Value Decomposition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal resolution","Narrowband","Acoustics","Diffraction","Dictionaries","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","compressed sensing","distortion","echo","flaw detection","singular value decomposition","ultrasonic devices","ultrasonic measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband ultrasonic detection","high range resolution","compressed sensing","singular value decomposition","ultrasonic flaw detection","upper frequency","transmitted signal","highfrequency ultrasound","penetration depth","band-limited signals","far-field detection","theoretical analysis","narrowband detection","broadband detection","highly overlapping narrowband echoes","range imaging","sparse representation","signal distortions","stability"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband Ultrasonic Detection with High Range Resolution: Separating Echoes via Compressed Sensing and Singular Value Decomposition","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6327495/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13100398","pubMedId":"23143573","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband Ultrasonic Detection with High Range Resolution: Separating Echoes via Compressed Sensing and Singular Value Decomposition","sourcePdf":"t12a2237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165502S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6327478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6327478","articleId":"6327495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6327580,"authors":[{"name":"Keang-Po Ho","affiliation":["Silicon Image, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Keang-Po Ho (S'91\u2013M'95\u2013SM'03) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1991, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, in 1993 and 1995, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He performed research in IBM T.

The channel spacing is 16 GHz, corresponding to 1.024 times the symbol rate. The interchannel crosstalk penalty is drastically reduced through the confinement of the signal spectrum within a near-Nyquist bandwidth, achieved with digital filtering and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) operating at 1.5 samples/symbol. The optical line is a recirculating loop composed of two spans of high-performance PSCF with erbium-doped fiber amplifiers only.

In the end, we apply both methods to compare MRC diversity gains and MIMO capacity measured in a reverberation chamber (based on direct channel measurements) and an anechoic chamber (based on measurements of the embedded far field functions and efficiencies at all antenna ports). The comparison is performed over 2-8 GHz using a wideband multi-port antenna in two configurations.

A new scheme is proposed, which exploits two low-rank structures that exist in MRSI data, one due to partial separability and the other due to linear predictability. Denoising is performed by arranging the measured data in appropriate matrix forms (i.e., Casorati and Hankel) and applying low-rank approximations by singular value decomposition (SVD). The proposed method has been validated using simulated and experimental data, producing encouraging results. Specifically, the method can effectively denoise MRSI data in a wide range of SNR values while preserving spatial-spectral features. The method could prove useful for denoising MRSI data and other spatial-spectral and spatial-temporal imaging data as well.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2223466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2223466","startPage":"78","endPage":"89","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6384873/06327614.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data With Low-Rank Approximations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Denoising MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data With Low-Rank Approximations","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327614/","accessionNumber":"13187694","pubMedId":"23070291","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327614/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data With Low-Rank Approximations","sourcePdf":"tbme-pt1-nguyen-2223466-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154921S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6384873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6384873","articleId":"6327614","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6327618,"authors":[{"name":"John F.

The transmitter employs a source-series terminated (SST) driver topology which doubles the speed of existing half-rate designs. The high-frequency boost provided by the peaking amplifier is enhanced by adopting a structure with capacitively coupled parallel input stages and active feedback. A capacitive level-shifting technique is introduced in the half-rate DFE which allows a single current-integrating summer to drive the four parallel paths used for speculating the first two DFE taps. Error-free signaling at 28 Gb/s is demonstrated with the transceiver over a channel with 35 dB loss at half-baud frequency.

The proposed pixel can alternately provide both color and depth images in each frame. Two split photodiode and four transfer gates in each pixel improve the transfer speed of generated electrons to be capable of demodulating a high-frequency time-of-flight signal. In addition, four-shared pixel architecture acquires a color image with high spatial resolution and generates a reliable depth map by inherent binning operation in charge domain. A 712 496 pixel array has been fabricated using a 0.11\u03bcm standard CMOS imaging process and fully characterized. A 6m pixel with 34.5% aperture ratio can be operated at 10-MHz modulation frequency with 70% demodulation contrast. We have successfully captured both images of exactly same scene from the fabricated test chip. It shows a depth uncertainty of less than 60 mm and a linearity error of about 2% between 1 and 3 m distance with 50-ms integration time.

The transmitter including a pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS) generator, multiplexers, an encoder, and an output driver achieves 10-Gb/s data-rate with 235-mW power dissipation such that the figure of merit (FOM) of the transmitter part is 23.5 mW/(Gb/s). The receiver including a flash type analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a decoder, and output drivers achieves 10-Gb/s data-rate and 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n BER with 190-mW power dissipation such that FOM of the receiver part is 19 mW/(Gb/s).

The insertion of communication networks in a master-slave synchronization scheme inevitably induces network delays, packet dropouts and stochastic fluctuations. The data packets may be received with a different temporal order from that they are sent due to the fact that the network-induced delay is time-varying. A logic data processor and a logic zero order hold are proposed in the master-slave synchronization framework. Then an error system for the master system and the slave system is formulated. By combining a generalized Jensen integral inequality and a convex combination technique, some synchronization criteria are derived to ensure the mean-square global exponential synchronization of state trajectories for the master system and the slave system. The controller gain matrix is obtained by solving a minimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities using a cone complementary technique. As a special case in which only network-induced delays and packet dropouts are occurred in the signal transmission channels, some results are also presented. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215793","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6468162/06327622.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"689","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Based Synchronization of Delayed Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Network-Based Synchronization of Delayed Neural Networks","volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13325862","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6327622/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Based Synchronization of Delayed Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsi-han-2215793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110419S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6468162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6468162","articleId":"6327622","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6327623,"authors":[{"name":"Trong-Hieu Ngo","affiliation":["Photonic Computer Systems Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","Digital IP Development Team, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Giheung, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6419840/6327623/6327623-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Trong-Hieu Ngo received the B.S. degree from Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT), Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2003, the M.S. degree from Information and Communications University (ICU), Korea, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 2011.","He held R&D positions at the Research Institute of Posts and Telecommunications (RIPT) in Vietnam, the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), and Teltron Inc. in Korea.

A thorough experimental investigation was carried out to identify the tools that most affect the encoding efficiency and computational complexity of the HEVC encoder. A set of 16 different encoding configurations was created to investigate the impact of each tool, varying the encoding parameter set and comparing the results with a baseline encoder. This paper shows that, even though the computational complexity increases monotonically from the baseline to the most complex configuration, the encoding efficiency saturates at some point. Moreover, the results of this paper provide relevant information for implementation of complexity-constrained encoders by taking into account the tradeoff between complexity and coding efficiency. It is shown that low-complexity encoding configurations, defined by careful selection of coding tools, achieve coding efficiency comparable to that of high-complexity configurations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and Computational Complexity Assessment of High-Efficiency Video Encoders","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223411","startPage":"1899","endPage":"1909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6403920/06327641.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance and Computational Complexity Assessment of High-Efficiency Video Encoders","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6327641/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13219100","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and Computational Complexity Assessment of High-Efficiency Video Encoders","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-correa-2223411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076307S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6403920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"6403920","articleId":"6327641","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6327642,"authors":[{"name":"Spencer G.

Due to the reduced amount of computation required for computing BASIS descriptors, reduced descriptor size, and the ability to create the descriptors without the use of a floating point, this approach is an excellent candidate for FPGA hardware implementation. The bit-level-accurate BASIS descriptor was tested on a dataset of real aerial images with the task of calculating a frame-to-frame homography and compared to software versions of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and speeded-up robust features (SURF). Experimental results show that the BASIS descriptor outperforms SIFT and performs comparably to SURF on frame-to-frame aerial feature point matching. BASIS descriptors require less memory storage than other descriptors and can be computed entirely in hardware, allowing the descriptor to operate at real-time frame rates on a low-power embedded platform such as an FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6512064/06327642.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Nature-Inspired BASIS Feature Descriptor for UAV Imagery and Its Hardware Implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327642/","displayDocTitle":"The Nature-Inspired BASIS Feature Descriptor for UAV Imagery and Its Hardware Implementation","volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13475407","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327642/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Nature-Inspired BASIS Feature Descriptor for UAV Imagery and Its Hardware Implementation","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lee-2223631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171871S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6512064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6512064","articleId":"6327642","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6327658,"authors":[{"name":"Lu\u00eds Filipe da Cruz Nassif","affiliation":["University of Bonn, Brasilia, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6392970/6327658/6327658-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lu\u00eds Filipe da Cruz Nassif received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the Military Institute of Engineering (IME), Brazil, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Brasilia (UnB), Brazil, in 2011.","Since 2006, he has been working as a computer forensic examiner with the Brazilian Federal Police Department, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

Much of the data in those files consists of unstructured text, whose analysis by computer examiners is difficult to be performed. In this context, automated methods of analysis are of great interest. In particular, algorithms for clustering documents can facilitate the discovery of new and useful knowledge from the documents under analysis. We present an approach that applies document clustering algorithms to forensic analysis of computers seized in police investigations. We illustrate the proposed approach by carrying out extensive experimentation with six well-known clustering algorithms (K-means, K-medoids, Single Link, Complete Link, Average Link, and CSPA) applied to five real-world datasets obtained from computers seized in real-world investigations. Experiments have been performed with different combinations of parameters, resulting in 16 different instantiations of algorithms. In addition, two relative validity indexes were used to automatically estimate the number of clusters. Related studies in the literature are significantly more limited than our study. Our experiments show that the Average Link and Complete Link algorithms provide the best results for our application domain. If suitably initialized, partitional algorithms (K-means and K-medoids) can also yield to very good results. Finally, we also present and discuss several practical results that can be useful for researchers and practitioners of forensic computing.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2223679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2223679","startPage":"46","endPage":"54","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6392970/06327658.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Document Clustering for Forensic Analysis: An Approach for Improving Computer Inspection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Document Clustering for Forensic Analysis: An Approach for Improving Computer Inspection","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327658/","accessionNumber":"13190851","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327658/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Document Clustering for Forensic Analysis: An Approach for Improving Computer Inspection","sourcePdf":"tifs-hruschka-2223679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084169S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6392970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6392970","articleId":"6327658","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6327663,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu S.

One such technique is altering facial appearance using surgical procedures that has raised a challenge for face recognition algorithms. Increasing popularity of plastic surgery and its effect on automatic face recognition has attracted attention from the research community. However, the nonlinear variations introduced by plastic surgery remain difficult to be modeled by existing face recognition systems. In this research, a multiobjective evolutionary granular algorithm is proposed to match face images before and after plastic surgery. The algorithm first generates non-disjoint face granules at multiple levels of granularity. The granular information is assimilated using a multiobjective genetic approach that simultaneously optimizes the selection of feature extractor for each face granule along with the weights of individual granules. On the plastic surgery face database, the proposed algorithm yields high identification accuracy as compared to existing algorithms and a commercial face recognition system.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2223684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6392970/06327663.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2223684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392970","startPage":"89","endPage":"100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing Surgically Altered Face Images Using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing Surgically Altered Face Images Using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13190854","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327663/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing Surgically Altered Face Images Using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tifs-vatsa-2223684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077448S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6392970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6392970","articleId":"6327663","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6327665,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["CSIRO ICT Centre, Wireless and Networking Technologies Laboratory, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37407136200"},{"name":"Himal A.

This new variable stiffness actuator significantly differs from its predecessor on the mechanism used for the stiffness regulation. While AwAS tunes the stiffness by regulating the position of the compliant elements along the lever arm, AwAS-II changes the position of the lever's pivot point. As a result of the new principle, AwAS-II can change the stiffness in a much broader range (from zero to infinity) even by using softer springs and shorter lever arm, compared to AwAS. This makes the setup of AwAS-II more compact and lighter and improves the stiffness regulation response. To evaluate the aptitude of the fast stiffness adjustment, experiments on reproducing the stiffness profile of the human ankle during the stance phase of a normal walking gait are conducted. Results indicate that AwAS-II is capable of reproducing an interpolated stiffness profile of the ankle while providing a net positive work and thus a sufficient amount of energy as required for the toe-off.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2218615","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6716101/06327673.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2218615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Actuator With Adjustable Stiffness Based on a Variable Ratio Lever Mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327673/","displayDocTitle":"A New Actuator With Adjustable Stiffness Based on a Variable Ratio Lever Mechanism","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14040728","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327673/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Actuator With Adjustable Stiffness Based on a Variable Ratio Lever Mechanism","sourcePdf":"tmech-jafari-2218615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094109S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6716101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6716101","articleId":"6327673","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6327677,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoyan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Gaoyan Zhang was born in Henan, China.

Previous studies have shown that the DMN can be altered by development, aging, disorder, cognitive tasks and offline training. However, it's unclear whether activity in the DMN can be altered by real-time training. Recently, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), as a novel neurofeedback technique, has been applied to train subjects to voluntarily control activities in specific brain regions. In the current study, it was found that by using rtfMRI to guide training, subjects were able to learn to decrease activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which is a \u201ckey hub\u201d in the DMN, using motor imagery strategy. After the real-time training, activity in the medial prefrontral cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (MPFC/ACC) of the resting state DMN was decreased. By contrast, the control group without neurofeedback produced increased activity in the MPFC/ACC of the DMN during the post-training resting state. These findings suggest that this rtfMRI technique has great potential to be used in the regulation of the DMN and may be a novel approach for studying functional plasticity of the cortex.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neurofeedback","Real-time systems","Educational institutions","Fingers","Head","Brain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","cognition","image sequences","medical image processing","neurophysiology","plasticity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DMN","learned regulation","PCC","real-time fMRI","default mode network","brain region","cognitively demanding task","aging","offline training","real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging","novel neurofeedback method","posterior cingulate cortex","motor imagery strategy","resting state DMN","cortex functional plasticity","image sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alteration","cortical plasticity","default mode network (DMN)","posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)","real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cerebral Cortex","Computer Systems","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Feedback, Physiological","Female","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Imagination","Learning","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male","Nerve Net","Neuronal Plasticity","Oxygen","Principal Component Analysis","Psychomotor Performance","Questionnaires","Young Adult"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2221480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/6552234/06327677.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6552234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2221480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional Alteration of the DMN by Learned Regulation of the PCC Using Real-Time fMRI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Functional Alteration of the DMN by Learned Regulation of the PCC Using Real-Time fMRI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327677/","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327677/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13654716","pubMedId":"23070370","dateOfInsertion":"03 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional Alteration of the DMN by Learned Regulation of the PCC Using Real-Time fMRI","sourcePdf":"tnsre-long-2221480-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14585S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6552234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6552234","articleId":"6327677","onlineDate":"09 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":6327685,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Jadaliha","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Michigan State University, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6387660/6327685/6327685-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahdi Jadaliha received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007.","Currently, he is working toward the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering at Michigan State University, East Lansing, under the guidance of Prof. J.

The analytically intractable posterior predictive statistics are proposed to be approximated by two techniques, viz., Monte Carlo sampling and Laplace's method. Such approximation techniques have been carefully tailored to our problems and their approximation error and complexity are analyzed. Simulation study demonstrates that the proposed approaches perform much better than approaches without considering the localization uncertainty properly. Finally, we have applied the proposed approaches on the experimentally collected real data from a dye concentration field over a section of a river and a temperature field of an outdoor swimming pool to provide proof of concept tests and evaluate the proposed schemes in real situations.

Motivated by the recent rapid progress in the theory of polar codes, we propose a semi-parallel architecture for the implementation of successive cancellation decoding. We take advantage of the recursive structure of polar codes to make efficient use of processing resources.

We then show that the Golden code, the three and four antenna Perfect codes, the three antenna Threaded Algebraic Space-Time code and the four antenna rate 2 code of Srinath and Rajan are all full-diversity ACZF/ACZF-SIC decodable with complexity strictly less than that of their ML decoders.

However, only using a single trading rule may not be sufficient to predict the stock price trend accurately. Although some complex trading strategies combining various classes of trading rules have been proposed in the literature, they often pick only one rule for each class, which may lose valuable information from other rules in the same class. In this paper, a complex stock trading strategy, namely weight reward strategy (WRS), is proposed. WRS combines the two most popular classes of trading rules-moving average (MA) and trading range break-out (TRB). For both MA and TRB, WRS includes different combinations of the rule parameters to get a universe of 140 component trading rules in all. Each component rule is assigned a start weight and a reward/penalty mechanism based on profit is proposed to update these rules' weights over time. To determine the best parameter values of WRS, we employ an improved time variant Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with the objective of maximizing the annual net profit generated by WRS. The experiments show that our proposed WRS optimized by PSO outperforms the best moving average and trading range break-out rules.","doi":"10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327771","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294089/6327764/06327771.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex stock trading strategy based on Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Radio frequency","Training","Vectors","Birds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","pricing","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex stock trading strategy","single trading rule","stock price trend","weight reward strategy","WRS","moving average","MA","trading range break-out","TRB","reward-penalty mechanism","particle swarm optimization algorithm","PSO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Complex stock trading strategy based on Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327771/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2012","accessionNumber":"13059397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex stock trading strategy based on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"07paper41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294089","isNumber":"6327764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294089","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6327764","articleId":"6327771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6327774,"authors":[{"name":"Ralf Salomon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Salomon","id":"37275781300"},{"name":"Peter Heydebreck","affiliation":["Inno AG, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Heydebreck","id":"37887594900"},{"name":"Lars R.

But, since they depend on the quality of human knowledge they are prone to subjective false estimations. Moreover, even domain experts can fully describe only less complex systems which, in turn, limits the effectiveness of FCMs in real world applications. Thus, a technique is needed that, on the one hand, eases the use and, on the other hand, optimizes the formal structure of an FCM. Against that background, this article elucidates the use of different bio-inspired algorithms to optimize the application of the FCMs: Evolutionary Strategies (ES), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC). The proposed approaches are applied to a novel valuation technique using FCMs. Besides principal feasibility, we demonstrate its potential to facilitate the use of vague and incomplete expert knowledge in the valuation of complex investment opportunities such as, but not limited to, young high-technology ventures.","doi":"10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327774","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294089/6327764/06327774.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired optimization of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for their use as a means in the pricing of complex assets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327774/","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired optimization of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for their use as a means in the pricing of complex assets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13059400","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327774/","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired optimization of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for their use as a means in the pricing of complex assets","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"10paper22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078571S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294089","isNumber":"6327764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294089","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6327764","articleId":"6327774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6327781,"authors":[{"name":"Leandro Maciel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Industrial Automation, School of Electrical andComputer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Maciel","id":"38180319800"},{"name":"Fernando Gomide","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Industrial Automation, School of Electrical andComputer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Gomide","id":"37271287000"},{"name":"Rosangela Ballini","affiliation":["Department of Economic Theory, Institute of Economics, State University of Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rosangela","lastName":"Ballini","id":"37271286100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1803-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1802-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1801-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2380-8454"}],"articleNumber":"6327781","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"Forecasting the term structure of interest rates plays a crucial role in portfolio management, household finance decisions, business investment planning, and policy formulation.

Besides the usefulness evaluation of evolving methods to forecast yields, this paper suggests the interest rate factors forecasting taking into account multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) evolving systems, which reduces computational time complexity and provides more accurate forecasts.

analyzed and compared using the Mackey-Glass nonlinear chaotic time series. This system is a known benchmark test whose elements are hard to predict. Multi-layer Perceptron NN was chosen as a feed-forward neural network because it is still the most commonly used network in financial forecasting models. It is compared with the modified version of the so-called Dynamic Multi-layer Perceptron NN characterized with a dynamic neuron model, i.e., Auto Regressive Moving Average filter built into the hidden layer neurons. Thus, every hidden layer neuron has the ability to process previous values of its own activity together with new input signals. The obtained results indicate satisfactory forecasting characteristics of both networks. However, recurrent NN was more accurate in practically all tests using less number of hidden layer neurons than the feed-forward NN. This study once again confirmed a great effectiveness and potential of dynamic neural networks in modeling and predicting highly nonlinear processes. Their application in the design of financial forecasting models is therefore most recommended.","doi":"10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327793","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327764","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294089/6327764/06327793.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of feed-forward and recurrent neural networks in time series forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327793/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A comparison of feed-forward and recurrent neural networks in time series forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327793/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13059418","publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of feed-forward and recurrent neural networks in time series forecasting","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"29paper21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078379S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294089","isNumber":"6327764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294089","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6327764","articleId":"6327793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6327811,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The general hypothesis of this paper is that semantic similarity among financial concepts can be exploited in a hybrid genetic algorithm. A Knowledge-guided Genetic Algorithm for Forecasting is introduced to predict the values of financial statement variables. The mutation operation is guided by domain knowledge to make small or large changes in an organism. The algorithm makes a bigger (or smaller) change in the organism when the variables being forecast have higher (or lower) variability. The specific hypothesis is that the use of problem-specific knowledge improves the prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the use of domain knowledge improves the performance of the algorithm. The knowledge used in this experiment would reasonably be extended in various ways to be used by a refined genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327814","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294089/6327764/06327814.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-guided genetic algorithm for financial forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Genetic algorithms","Semantics","Organisms","Prediction algorithms","Accuracy","Companies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","financial management","forecasting theory","genetic algorithms","investment","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge-guided genetic algorithm","financial forecasting","machine learning algorithms","financial problems","semantic similarity","financial concepts","financial statement variable value prediction","financial investment decision-making problems","mutation operation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-guided genetic algorithm for financial forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327814/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 2012","accessionNumber":"13059439","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-guided genetic algorithm for financial forecasting","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"50paper67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064506S","chronDate":"29-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294089","isNumber":"6327764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294089","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6327764","articleId":"6327814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6327822,"authors":[{"name":"Terje Kristensen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bergen University College, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Terje","lastName":"Kristensen","id":"37330037300"},{"name":"Mauricio Enrique Mena Rojas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bergen University College, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Mauricio Enrique Mena","lastName":"Rojas","id":"38490586100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1803-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1802-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1801-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2380-8454"}],"articleNumber":"6327822","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327822","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Cost accounting","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Resource management","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distributed algorithms","electronic commerce","genetic algorithms","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["winner determination problem","distributed genetic algorithm","distributed system","WDP","combinatorial auctions","agents","item combination","good alocation","NP-complete problem","IBM algorithm","CPLEX"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327822","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294089/6327764/06327822.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving the Winner Determination Problem by a distributed genetic algorithm","abstract":"In this paper we present a distributed system that is capable of solving the Winner Determination Problem (WDP) for combinatorial auctions by use of a genetic algorithm.

Due to rapid growth in affordability, increased sensory and computational power has opened the ways for some interesting applications like activity recognition, gaming, navigation/tracking, augmented reality etc. In all these applications orientation of mobile phone is very important, once we know the correct orientation of the device, it becomes easy to develop such applications. Orientation can be determined by sensor fusion of accelerometer and magnetometer but it provides good accuracy as long as device is stationary or not moving linearly and also it suffers from surrounding magnetic interference. Orientation estimation systems often use gyroscope to increase reliability and accuracy. Although gyroscopes provide a quick response to change in angles and do not have problems like interference, they suffer from bias and integration errors which introduce drift in signal. In this paper an efficient and less complicated approach is utilized which minimizes the drift and noise in output orientation. In most of smart phone navigation applications these days, it is assumed that mobile is at fixed position like holding in hand facing forward, in trouser/jacket pocket or attached to waist. But if we assume that mobile position is changing arbitrary then situation becomes complicated. The goal of this work is to find accurately the direction of movement of a pedestrian while holding mobile in any position. In this work an accelerometer based approach is presented for pedestrian direction of movement estimation.","doi":"10.1109/NGMAST.2012.36","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2012.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327921","pdfPath":"/iel5/6327835/6327921/06327933.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart phones","Accelerometers","Magnetometers","Gyroscopes","Mobile communication","Equations","Earth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","gyroscopes","magnetometers","radionavigation","sensor fusion","smart phones","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["movement determination pedestrian direction","mobile platform","computational power","sensory power","activity recognition","navigation-tracking","augmented reality","accelerometer sensor fusion","magnetometer","magnetic interference","orientation estimation systems","reliability","gyroscopes","smart phone navigation applications","trouser-jacket pocket","mobile position","accelerometer based approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian Direction of Movement Determination Using Smartphone","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327933/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6327933/","accessionNumber":"13061345","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian Direction of Movement Determination Using Smartphone","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4803a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051539S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6327835","isNumber":"6327921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6327835","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6327921","articleId":"6327933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6327945,"authors":[{"name":"Belgacem Aouadi","affiliation":["InnovCOM, Higher School of Communications of Tunis, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Belgacem","lastName":"Aouadi","id":"38488931900"},{"name":"Jamel Belhadj Tahar","affiliation":["InnovCOM, Higher School of Communications of Tunis, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Jamel Belhadj","lastName":"Tahar","id":"38561120900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2598-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4803-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2897"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2889"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-2889"}],"articleNumber":"6327945","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Metamaterials","Patch antennas","Permeability","Antenna radiation patterns","Mutual coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","metamaterials","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","permeability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output antennas","wireless communications","left-handed metamaterials","E-shaped patch antenna","cognitive radio","MIMO antenna array","LHM","split ring resonator","SRR","negative permeability","resonate frequency","antenna design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","E shaped patch antenna","mutual coupling","Left hand metamateria","negative permeability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a simple kind of E-shaped patch antenna is proposed for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) applications in cognitive radio at about 15 GHz.

This paper extends this scheme to relay-aided case attempting the further performance improvement, after certain time has passed from disaster, the arrival of portable relay systems could be anticipated if they are previously prepared. Allocating one relay to each cell with a defect BS, the effectiveness of relay-aided processing and influence of related parameters are evaluated from the viewpoint of cooperative transmission through computer simulations.

dynamic spectrum access paradigm, reliable spectrum sensing is essential for the efficient utilization of the underutilized spectrum as well as the protection of legacy spectrum users. To achieve reliability, it is important for sensing techniques to meet detection requirements, such as the maximum allowed detection time, the probability of misdetection and the probability of false alarm. In this paper, a spectrum sensing scheme named iDetection is proposed that minimizes the probability of misdetection, false alarm and the mean detection time. Based on the power and the band of interest, the iDetection scheme selects either the combined energy detector and cyclostationary detector or the matched filter detection. The band of interest notifies whether the primary user waveform is known or not, whereas, power indicates the noise uncertainty in the received waveform. To evaluate the proposed scheme a comparison is conducted on the basis of the probability of detection, the probability of false alarm and the mean detection time. The results manifest that iDetection scheme outperforms all other existing local spectrum sensing techniques including energy detection, matched filter detection and cyclostationary detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13061360","htmlLink":"/document/6327948/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"iDetection: Intelligent Primary User Detection for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iDetection: Intelligent Primary User Detection for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4803a153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060231S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6327835","isNumber":"6327921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6327835","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6327921","articleId":"6327948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6327952,"authors":[{"name":"Allan B.

systems for the automatic detection of abnormal events by the interpretation of the audio track, but also in conjunction with video analytics tools for enforcing the evidence of anomaly detection. In this paper we present an automatic recognizer of a set of abnormal audio events that works by extracting suitable features from the signals obtained by microphones installed into a surveilled area, and by classifying them using two classifiers that operate at different time resolutions. An original aspect of the proposed system is the estimation of the reliability of each response of the individual classifiers. In this way, each classifier is able to reject the samples having an overall reliability below a threshold. This approach allows our system to combine only reliable decisions, so increasing the overall performance of the method. The system has been tested on a large dataset of samples acquired from real world scenarios, the audio classes of interests are represented by gunshot, scream and glass breaking in addition to the background sounds. The preliminary results obtained encourage further research in this direction.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2012.9","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/6327837/6327974/06327988.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2012.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327974","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ensemble of Rejecting Classifiers for Anomaly Detection of Audio Events","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Ensemble of Rejecting Classifiers for Anomaly Detection of Audio Events","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6327988/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13061386","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6327988/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ensemble of Rejecting Classifiers for Anomaly Detection of Audio Events","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4797a076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083243S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6327837","isNumber":"6327974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6327837","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6327974","articleId":"6327988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6327990,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Acampora","affiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Information Systems, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Acampora","id":"37397106400"},{"name":"Pasquale Foggia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (DIEII), University of Salerno, Italy"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Foggia","id":"37281360600"},{"name":"Alessia Saggese","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (DIEII), University of Salerno, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessia","lastName":"Saggese","id":"37323089000"},{"name":"Mario Vento","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (DIEII), University of Salerno, Italy"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Vento","id":"37281314200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4797-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2499-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6327990","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6327990","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Semantics","Trajectory","Legged locomotion","Taxonomy","Context","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","fuzzy systems","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","fuzzy systems","human behavior understanding","psychological overcharge issue","human inadequacy","multiple visual information sources","enhanced video surveillance systems","semantic human behavioral analysis system","HBA","neuro-fuzzy approach","tracking kinematic data translation","semantic labels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","fuzzy system","human behavior understanding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2012.25","pdfPath":"/iel5/6327837/6327974/06327990.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2012.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems for Human Behavior Understanding","abstract":"The psychological overcharge issue related to human inadequacy to maintain a constant level of attention in simultaneously monitoring multiple visual information sources makes necessary to develop enhanced video surveillance systems that automatically understand human behaviors and identify dangerous situations.

In particular, realistic setups show difficulties such as different camera angles or different camera properties. Additionally, also the appearance of exactly the same person can change dramatically due to different views (e.g., frontal/back) of carried objects. In this paper, we mainly address the first problem by learning the transition from one camera to the other. This is realized by learning a Mahalanobis metric using pairs of labeled samples from different cameras. Building on the ideas of Large Margin Nearest Neighbor classification, we obtain a more efficient solution which additionally provides much better generalization properties. To demonstrate these benefits, we run experiments on three different publicly available datasets, showing state-of-the-art or even better results, however, on much lower computational efforts. This is in particular interesting since we use quite simple color and texture features, whereas other approaches build on rather complex image descriptions!","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2012.55","pdfPath":"/iel5/6327837/6327974/06328017.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"208","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2012.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Person Re-identification by Efficient Impostor-Based Metric Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Person Re-identification by Efficient Impostor-Based Metric Learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13061410","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328017/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Person Re-identification by Efficient Impostor-Based Metric Learning","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4797a203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060965S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6327837","isNumber":"6327974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6327837","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6327974","articleId":"6328017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328038,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Ding","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Ding","id":"38239680000"},{"name":"Kaiqi Huang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Kaiqi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37402212100"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4797-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2499-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6328038","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Image sequences","Algorithm design and analysis","Kernel","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","Fourier analysis","image motion analysis","image restoration","natural scenes","object tracking","particle filtering (numerical methods)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blurred object tracking","data-driven tracker","motion blur detection","image sequences","cameras","particle filtering","Fourier analysis","motion blur kernels","blur effects","image scenes","videos","algorithm robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object tracking","motion blur","data-driven"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328038","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2012.78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2012.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327974","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/6327837/6327974/06328038.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking Blurred Object with Data-Driven Tracker","abstract":"Motion blur is very common in the low quality of image sequences and videos captured by low speed of cameras.

We propose a new data-driven tracker in the particle filter framework to address this problem without deblurring the image sequences. The motion blur is detected by exploring the property of the blurred input image through Fourier analysis. The appearance model is integrated with a set of motion blur kernels which could reflect different blur effects in real scenes. The motion model is improved to be more robust to sudden motion of the target object. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, several challenging videos with significant motion blur are used in the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328038/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13061431","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tracking Blurred Object with Data-Driven Tracker","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking Blurred Object with Data-Driven Tracker","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4797a331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054233S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6327837","isNumber":"6327974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6327837","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6327974","articleId":"6328038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328050,"authors":[{"name":"Michael P\u00e4tzold","affiliation":["Communication System Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"P\u00e4tzold","id":"37848905500"},{"name":"Rub\u00e9n Heras Evangelio","affiliation":["Communication System Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Rub\u00e9n Heras","lastName":"Evangelio","id":"37846259200"},{"name":"Thomas Sikora","affiliation":["Communication System Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Sikora","id":"37273633400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4797-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2499-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6328050","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Standards","Computational modeling","Kalman filters","Biological system modeling","Data models","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","object tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual person tracking-by-detection system","online-learned instance-specific information","generic person-category detector","track initialization","crowded situation","standard MHT-framework","detection-to-object association ambiguity elimination","video sequences","multihypothesis tracking boosting","kinematic relation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MHT","Tracking","Adaboost"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328050","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2012.18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2012.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327974","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/6327837/6327974/06328050.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting Multi-hypothesis Tracking by Means of Instance-Specific Models","abstract":"In this paper we present a visual person tracking-by-detection system based on on-line-learned instance-specific information along with the kinematic relation of measurements provided by a generic person-category detector.

The human intervention of urban search and rescue (USAR) teams, including USAR dogs, has to be done cautiously so as to protect the rescue workers from further collapses. Debris may be so cluttered that prevent the close human access to the victims. Also, potential risk of further landslide requires the propping of the structures before human intervention. Rescue preparation operations may be time consuming, and a fast action to locate survivors and to take them human voices, light and/or water is a crucial factor for life. Therefore, there is the clear need for search and rescue robots that can be released immediately after a disaster in which the conditions are too dangerous and too cluttered for people and dogs to begin searching for victims. Teams of such robots should desirably be heterogeneous (e.g., aerial robots to perform scenario reconnaissance, powerful land robots to remove debris, small agile land robots to reach survivors buried under the debris), be able to perform with a given level of adjustable autonomy (as the presence of humans in the team to take crucial decisions will always be required) and be easy-to-learn and simple to launch and friendly to operate.

In this paper, we propose a method pursuing performance gain of vector perturbation in multiuser downlink systems. Instead of employing the maximum number of mobile users for communication, we use small part of them as virtual users for improving reliability of users participating communication. By controlling parameters of the virtual users including information and perturbation vector, we obtain considerable improvement in the effective SNR. Simulation results on the realistic multiuser MISO and MIMO downlink systems show that the proposed method brings substantial performance gain over the standard vector perturbation with marginal overhead in computations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.092612.110394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6362326/06328205.pdf","startPage":"3322","endPage":"3331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.092612.110394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Vector Perturbation with User Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328205/","displayDocTitle":"A Vector Perturbation with User Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","volume":"60","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148539","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328205/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Vector Perturbation with User Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","sourcePdf":"3322-tc1211-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102918S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6362326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6362326","articleId":"6328205","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6328206,"authors":[{"name":"Aydin Behnad","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6451308/6328206/6328206-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aydin Behnad (S'09-M'12) received the B.

Largely ignored in the literature, this assumption leads to more realistic results, as in a typical practical scenario neither the number of relays nor their distances from the source and destination are known. An exact expression for the outage probability of this cooperative system for general fading environments and different types of relaying is derived. The expression is then {simplified under an assumption that the radius of the relay deployment region is sufficiently large}, and specialized to additive white Gaussian noise (no fading), Rayleigh fading and severe (half-Gaussian) fading environments. Simple and tight upper and lower bounds on the outage probability are also derived. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses and verify the accuracies of the proposed bounds.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.12.110411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.12.110411","startPage":"97","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6451308/06328206.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Opportunistic Relaying in a Poisson Field of Amplify-and-Forward Relays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Opportunistic Relaying in a Poisson Field of Amplify-and-Forward Relays","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2013","volume":"61","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328206/","accessionNumber":"13287989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328206/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Opportunistic Relaying in a Poisson Field of Amplify-and-Forward Relays","sourcePdf":"097-tc1301-behnad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069647S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6451308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6451308","articleId":"6328206","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6328207,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Namvar Gharehshiran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6451308/6328207/6328207-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omid Namvar Gharehshiran (S'09) received his B.

We study a downlink scenario where users collaborate to increase network throughput and, simultaneously, attempt to increase their own payoffs. Payoffs to the users are defined as the monetary equivalent of the individual users' achievable throughput in the specified coalition structure. A distributed game-theoretic resource allocation mechanism is developed whereby users autonomously decide which sub-channel in which coalition to join. If each user operates according to the proposed algorithm, the sum throughput of all links converges with probability one to its maximum feasible value.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6451308/06328207.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100312.110480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100312.110480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative Sub-Channel Allocation in Cognitive LTE Femto-Cells: A Cooperative Game-Theoretic Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Games","Collaboration","Vectors","Interference","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","game theory","Long Term Evolution","probability","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative sub-channel allocation","cognitive LTE femto-cells","cooperative game-theoretic approach","resource allocation","UMTS","Long Term Evolution","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative game","distributed coalition formation","femto-cell","resource allocation","UMTS LTE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Sub-Channel Allocation in Cognitive LTE Femto-Cells: A Cooperative Game-Theoretic Approach","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6328207/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13287990","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Sub-Channel Allocation in Cognitive LTE Femto-Cells: A Cooperative Game-Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"325-tc1301-ghareh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09777S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6451308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6451308","articleId":"6328207","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328208,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["Wireless and Networking Technologies Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6451308/6328208/6328208-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan Yang (S'09-M'11) received the B.S. degree in Electronics from China Agricultural University, China, in 2005, the M.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, China in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2010.

We focus on the practical scenario where the transmitter does not have any channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper's channel. The transmitter selects a single antenna that maximizes the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. The receiver and the eavesdropper employ either maximal-ratio combining (MRC) or selection combining (SC) to combine the received signals. For the proposed protocols, we derive new closed-form expressions for the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity.

In an SUS algorithm, a base station schedules semi-orthogonal users using the feedback of all users' channel information. However, such feedback overhead significantly increases with the number of users. To reduce the feedback load of ZFBF-SUS systems, the proposed two-stage feedback scheme opportunistically and separately exploits the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and orthogonality in each stage such that only a fraction of users feed back their channel information. Based on this opportunistic feedback scheme, we decouple the entire process of the SUS into two sub-processes. The proposed two-stage feedback and scheduling scheme effectively exclude the inappropriate users for ZFBF transmission in both feedback and scheduling periods, and thus save the scarce resources consumed for the feedback process. We derive an analytical expression for the average number of feedback bits of the proposed system and optimize it in an averaged sense. Further, the sum-rate of the proposed system is theoretically investigated. Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the performance of conventional ZFBF-SUS systems with a significantly reduced number of feedback bits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6451308/06328212.pdf","startPage":"312","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.092612.120024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.092612.120024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Two-Stage Feedback and Scheduling for MIMO Downlink Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Quantization","Vectors","Feeds","Downlink","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio links","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic two-stage feedback","MIMO downlink system","scheduling algorithm","zero-forcing beamforming","semiorthogonal user selection","feedback load reduction","base station","semiorthogonal user scheduling","ZFBF-SUS system","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","opportunistic feedback scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast channel","zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF)","semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS)","limited feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Two-Stage Feedback and Scheduling for MIMO Downlink Systems","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6328212/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13287995","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Two-Stage Feedback and Scheduling for MIMO Downlink Systems","sourcePdf":"312-tc1301-min.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129009S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6451308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6451308","articleId":"6328212","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328213,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6451308/6328213/6328213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Xu (S'09) received a B.

More explicitly, the detection of the SM scheme, which activates a single one out of M antennas to transmit a single LPSK/QAM symbol, may be carried out by detecting the antenna activation index m and the LPSK/QAM symbol s\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n separately, so that the detection complexity may be reduced from the order of O(M \u00b7 L) to the lower bound of O(M + log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n L). However, the QAM aided STSK hard detection proposed in [1] results in a performance loss. Furthermore, the Max-Log-MAP algorithm proposed for soft STSK detection in [2] only takes into account the maximum a posteriori probabilities, which also imposed a performance degradation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel solution for hard-decision-aided SM/STSK detection, which retains its optimal performance, despite its reduced detection complexity, when either LPSK or LQAM is employed. Furthermore, we propose the reduced-complexity Approx-Log-MAP algorithm conceived for the soft-decision-aided SM/STSK detector, in order to replace the suboptimal Max-Log-MAP algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Modulation and Space-Time Shift Keying: Optimal Performance at a Reduced Detection Complexity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100312.120251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6451308/06328213.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100312.120251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Modulation and Space-Time Shift Keying: Optimal Performance at a Reduced Detection Complexity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6328213/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2013","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13287996","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Modulation and Space-Time Shift Keying: Optimal Performance at a Reduced Detection Complexity","sourcePdf":"206-tc1301-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11452S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6451308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6451308","articleId":"6328213","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328215,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6362326/6328215/6328215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiang Chen (S'09) received the B.E. degree in electronics and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008.

In particular, the position of the relay (between the source and destination) determines the path-loss effects of adjacent hops, which will further affect the performance of each hop and thus the relay system. In this paper, by minimizing the outage probability of a decode-and-forward (DF) MIMO relay system with orthogonal space-time block coding, we show that relay position optimization improves the finite-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) diversity gain of a relay system whose adjacent hops have different diversity orders (unbalanced system). Specifically, with relay position optimization, the diversity gain is no longer bounded by that of the weaker hop, i.e., the hop with a lower diversity order, but approaches the diversity order of the stronger hop. This diversity improvement provides a dramatic improvement for the end-to-end outage probability. It will also be shown that although power allocation has no effects on the achievable diversity order, it provides some SNR gains.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100312.110033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6362326/06328215.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100312.110033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362326","startPage":"3311","endPage":"3321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Position Optimization Improves Finite-SNR Diversity Gain of Decode-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relay Position Optimization Improves Finite-SNR Diversity Gain of Decode-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148540","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328215/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Position Optimization Improves Finite-SNR Diversity Gain of Decode-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"3311-tc1211-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136562S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6362326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6362326","articleId":"6328215","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328225,"authors":[{"name":"Garrick Orchard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6328225/6328225-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Garrick Orchard received the B.

Moreover, video data or sequences of images contain even more correlation, leading to a much sparser representation as demonstrated repeatedly in numerous digital video formats and international standards. Compressive sensing has inspired the design of a number of imagers which take advantage of the need to only subsample a scene, which reduces power consumption by requiring acquisition and transmission of fewer samples. In this paper, we show how missing pixels in a video sequence can be estimated using compressive sensing techniques. We present a real time implementation of our algorithm and show its application to an asynchronous time-based image sensor (ATIS) from the Austrian Institute of Technology. The ATIS only provides pixel intensity data when and where a change in pixel intensity is detected, however, noise randomly causes intensity changes to be falsely detected, thereby providing random samples of static regions of the scene. Unlike other compressive sensing imagers, which typically have pseudo-random sampling designed in at extra effort, the ATIS used here provides random samples as a side effect of circuit noise. Here, we describe and analyze a field-programmable gate array implementation of a matching pursuit (MP) algorithm for compressive sensing reconstruction capable of reconstructing over 1.9 million 8 \u00d7 8 pixel regions per second with a sparsity of 11 using a basis dictionary containing 64 elements. In our application to ATIS we achieve throughput of 28 frames per second at a resolution of 304 \u00d7 240 pixels with reconstruction accuracy comparable to that of state of the art algorithms evaluated offline.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real Time Compressive Sensing Video Reconstruction in Hardware","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2214614","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06328225.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2214614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Real Time Compressive Sensing Video Reconstruction in Hardware","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6328225/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167807","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real Time Compressive Sensing Video Reconstruction in Hardware","sourcePdf":"jetcas-orchard-2214614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136956S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6328225","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6328226,"authors":[{"name":"Ashoke Ravi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6392234/6328226/6328226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashoke Ravi (S'99\u2013M'07\u2013SM'11) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.","Since 2001, he has been with Intel Labs, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, working on circuits and architectures for CMOS wireless transceivers."]},"firstName":"Ashoke","lastName":"Ravi","id":"37282145700"},{"name":"Paolo Madoglio","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6392234/6328226/6328226-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Madoglio (S'04\u2013M'10) was born in Milan, Italy, in 1981.

A phase MUX architecture is proposed to implement switching between phases once every LO period (2.4 GHz) without generating detrimental glitches at the output.

Thus, the most effective way for screen content coding (SCC) is to use two essentially different coders: a dictionary-entropy coder and a traditional hybrid coder. Although screen content is originally in a full-chroma (e.g., YUV444) format, the current method of compression is to first subsample chroma of pictures and then compress pictures using a chroma-subsampled (e.g., YUV420) coder. Using two chroma-subsampled coders cannot achieve high-quality SCC, but using two full-chroma coders is overkill and inefficient for SCC. To solve the dilemma, this paper proposes a mixed chroma sampling-rate approach for SCC. An original full-chroma input macroblock (coding unit) or its prediction residual is chroma-subsampled. One full-chroma base coder and one chroma-subsampled base coder are used simultaneously to code the original and the chroma-subsampled macroblock, respectively.

The dc sources feeding the multilevel inverter are considered to be varying in time, and the switching angles are adapted to the dc source variation. This method uses genetic algorithms to obtain switching angles offline for different dc source values. Then, artificial neural networks are used to determine the switching angles that correspond to the real-time values of the dc sources for each phase. This implies that each one of the dc sources of this topology can have different values at any time, but the output fundamental voltage will stay constant and the harmonic content will still meet the specifications. The modulating switching angles are updated at each cycle of the output fundamental voltage.

Unexpected circuit failures in such systems during field operation can have severe implications. To address this concern, we developed a method for detecting faulty circuit condition, isolating fault locations, and predicting the remaining useful performance of analog circuits. Through the successive refinement of the circuit's response to a sweep signal, features are extracted for fault diagnosis. The fault diagnostics problem is posed and solved as a pattern recognition problem using kernel methods. From the extracted features, a fault indicator (FI) is developed for failure prognosis.

The adaptive estimator of the stator resistance is introduced. Such an approach to control of the PMSM motor gives better performance. It is robust to dynamic uncertainties and does not require knowledge of the system parameters. The mathematical equation was introduced. Simple method limitation of control variables is explained.

Forced machine current control (FMCC) is a predictive control strategy for MV drives which was proposed in the early 1980s, which can be formulated for either torque or current control. Recently, model predictive direct torque control (MPDTC) and model predictive direct current control (MPDCC) have been developed, sharing with FMCC the use of hysteresis bounds, switching and prediction horizons. However, the relative performances of these schemes are yet to be compared. Through simulation, this paper compares the schemes across a range of operating points. It is shown that the steady-state performance of MPDxC and FMCC is similar when the switching horizon of MPDxC is limited. However, when the switching horizon is extended, the performance of MPDxC is shown to be superior to FMCC, the horizon of which is inherently restricted.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2223706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6409420/06328273.pdf","endPage":"919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Model Predictive Control Schemes for MV Induction Motor Drives","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2223706","startPage":"909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Model Predictive Control Schemes for MV Induction Motor Drives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328273/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13220122","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6328273/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Model Predictive Control Schemes for MV Induction Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tii-scoltock-2223706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094761S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6409420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6409420","articleId":"6328273","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6328274,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas J.

However, the computational burden for this control scheme is very high and often restrictive for a good implementation. This means that a suitable technology and design approach should be used. In this paper, the implementation of FS-MBPC for flying-capacitor converters in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is discussed. The control is fully implemented in programmable digital logic by using a high-level design tool. This allows us to obtain very good performances (both in control quality, speed, and hardware utilization) and have a flexible, modular control configuration. The good performance is obtained by exploiting the FPGA's strong points: parallelism and pipelining. Furthermore, an improved cost function for the voltage control of the flying capacitors is proposed in this paper. Typical cost functions result in tracking control for the flying-capacitor voltages, although this does not correspond with the desired system behavior. The improved cost function offers a capacitor voltage control that corresponds more closely with the desired behavior and adds a limitation on the capacitor voltage deviation. Furthermore, the selection of the weight factor in the cost function becomes less critical.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Set Model-Based Predictive Control for Flying-Capacitor Converters: Cost Function Design and Efficient FPGA Implementation","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2223707","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2223707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6409420/06328274.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Set Model-Based Predictive Control for Flying-Capacitor Converters: Cost Function Design and Efficient FPGA Implementation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6328274/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13220123","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Set Model-Based Predictive Control for Flying-Capacitor Converters: Cost Function Design and Efficient FPGA Implementation","sourcePdf":"tii-vyncke-2223707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060688S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6409420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6409420","articleId":"6328274","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328284,"authors":[{"name":"Hoonki Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6328284/6328284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hoonki Kim (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007, where he is working toward the integrated M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.","His research interests are in mixed-signal integrated circuits, including low-power Nyquist-rate data converters, and dynamic power management."]},"firstName":"Hoonki","lastName":"Kim","id":"37656577600"},{"name":"Sangjin Kim","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Division, Samsung Electronics Limited, Suwon, Kyunggi, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6328284/6328284-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Sangjin Kim received the B.S. degree in control and instrumentation engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2012, respectively.","He joined Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Suwon, Korea, in 2005, where he is currently an Engineer with the Mobile Communications Division.

In this method, a dc-capacitor current control loop, where a negative-sequence resonant controller is used to increase the loop gain, is added to the conventional GSC current control loop. The rejection capability to the unbalanced grid voltage and the stability of the proposed control system are discussed. The second-order harmonic current in the dc capacitor as well as dc-voltage fluctuation is very well eliminated. Hence, the dc capacitors will be more reliable under unbalanced grid voltage conditions. A modular implementation method of the proposed control strategy is developed for the DFIG controller.

In addition to conventional star connection, five-phase PM motors can be connected in two penta-type connections, pentagon and pentacle. In the proposed unified approach, a general solution for fault-tolerant currents is presented which uses only the fundamental and third-harmonic current components for the excitation of the healthy stator phases. The proposed approach is based on mirror symmetry of healthy phase current with respect to the fault location and it is optimized to increase output average torque while reducing torque pulsations and minimizing ohmic losses. A general parametric solution is presented which can be applied to five-phase motor drives with any fault condition and winding connection by selecting proper optimization constraints. It is shown that penta-type connection results in improved fault-tolerant capability in terms of maximum ripple-free torque due to the absence of zero-neutral current constraint. Experimental results are presented to verify the proposed solutions for fault-tolerant current control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06328287.pdf","startPage":"3517","endPage":"3527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2223717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2223717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Fault-Tolerant Current Control Approach for Five-Phase PM Motors With Trapezoidal Back EMF Under Different Stator Winding Connections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Stator windings","Torque","Current control","Windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","electric potential","fault tolerance","machine control","minimisation","motor drives","permanent magnet motors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified fault-tolerant current control approach","five-phase PM motors","trapezoidal back EMF","stator winding connections","five-phase permanent-magnet motors","open-circuit phase","line faults","penta-type connections","third-harmonic current components","healthy stator phases","healthy phase current","fault location","ohmic loss minimization","general parametric solution","five-phase motor drives","optimization constraints","ripple-free torque","zero-neutral current constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault-tolerant control","five-phase machines","permanent-magnet (PM) machine","stator winding connections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Fault-Tolerant Current Control Approach for Five-Phase PM Motors With Trapezoidal Back EMF Under Different Stator Winding Connections","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6328287/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191069","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Fault-Tolerant Current Control Approach for Five-Phase PM Motors With Trapezoidal Back EMF Under Different Stator Winding Connections","sourcePdf":"tpel-parsa-2223717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063136S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6328287","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6328288,"authors":[{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6479286/6328288/6328288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Derong Liu (S'91\u2013M'94\u2013SM'96\u2013F'05) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from East China Institute of Technology (now Nanjing University of Science and Technology), Nanjing, China, in 1982; the M.S. degree in automatic control theory and applications from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1987; and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, in 1994.","He was a Product Design Engineer with China North Industries Corporation, Jilin, China, from 1982 to 1984.

The idea is to use an iterative ADP algorithm to obtain the iterative control law that makes the iterative performance index function reach the optimum. When the iterative control law and the iterative performance index function in each iteration cannot be accurately obtained, the convergence conditions of the iterative ADP algorithm are obtained. When convergence conditions are satisfied, it is shown that the iterative performance index functions can converge to a finite neighborhood of the greatest lower bound of all performance index functions under some mild assumptions. Neural networks are used to approximate the performance index function and compute the optimal control policy, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the iterative ADP algorithm. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the performance of the present method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6479286/06328288.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2216523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2216523","startPage":"779","endPage":"789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Approximation-Error-Based Optimal Control Approach for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328288/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Approximation-Error-Based Optimal Control Approach for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328288/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13383978","pubMedId":"23070311","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Approximation-Error-Based Optimal Control Approach for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-liu-2216523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073364S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6479286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"186","xplore-issue":"6479286","articleId":"6328288","onlineDate":"07 March 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328290,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Yu Sung","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6461155/6328290/6328290-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuang-Yu Sung (S\u201905) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1980.

With feedback of the previous channel estimate, pilot subcarriers at the source and relay can be reassigned to reduce channel estimation error and ensure that good subcarriers are made available for data transmission. The minimum effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among data subcarriers is utilized as the performance metric for the optimization of the pilot locations. The effective SNR is defined as the receive SNR at the destination, taking into consideration the source-to-relay (SR) and relay-to-destination (RD) channels, as well as their respective channel estimation errors. The feedback gain, which is defined as the ratio between the minimum effective SNR achieved with the optimal feedback-aided pilot placement and that achieved with the equal-spaced pilot placement, is used to measure the gains achieved through feedback. In this paper, we first derive an analytic lower bound on the optimal feedback gain and show its rate of increase with respect to the number of subcarriers. These studies are performed for systems both without and with subcarrier pairing (SP) at the relay. Specifically, in systems without SP, the relay forwards each datum on the same subcarrier on which it is received. In systems with SP, the relay is allowed to reassign the subcarriers used to forward the data received from the source. With the goal of maximizing the minimum effective SNR, the optimal SP scheme is shown to be an inverse mapping between the SR and RD subcarriers with respect to their channel gains. Due to the complexity of finding the optimal placement, a suboptimal but efficient algorithm called the iterative pilot relocation (IterPR) scheme is then proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed IterPR schemes is demonstrated through numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-Aided Pilot Placement and Subcarrier Pairing for AF OFDM Relay Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2223768","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06328290.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2223768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-Aided Pilot Placement and Subcarrier Pairing for AF OFDM Relay Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6328290/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13307160","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-Aided Pilot Placement and Subcarrier Pairing for AF OFDM Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-hong-2223768-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131452S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6328290","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328291,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Lin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xin-Lin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37540009100"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38183960800"},{"name":"Fei Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37291063500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6328291","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2074},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Hidden Markov models","Interference","Cognitive radio","Data mining","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressed sensing","data mining","decision making","hidden Markov models","mean square error methods","probability","radio spectrum management","regression analysis","signal reconstruction","telecommunication computing","Viterbi detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitask spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","compressive sensing","signal processing","sampling rate limitation","analog-to-digital converter","spectrum-sensing circuit","spectrum reconstruction error minimisation","linear regression method","\u21131-norm","spectrum sparseness","CS inversion","multitask spectrum-sensing method","spatiotemporal data mining method","cluster head","consensus decision making","Dirichlet process prior","time-domain relevance","hidden Markov model","Viterbi algorithm","spatiotemporal relationship","normalized mean square error","correct detection probability","false alarm probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network (CRN)","Dirichlet process (DP)","hidden Markov model (HMM)","spatiotemporal data mining","spectrum sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328291","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2223767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","abstract":"Recently, compressive sensing (CS) and spectrum sensing have been two hot topics in the signal processing and cognitive radio network (CRN) fields, respectively. Due to the sampling rate limitation of the analog-to-digital converter in spectrum-sensing circuits, some works have proposed integrating these two techniques to achieve low-overhead spectrum sensing in CRNs. These works aim to minimize spectrum reconstruction errors based on linear regression methods, and \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm is typically used to make a tradeoff between spectrum sparseness and reconstruction accuracy. However, since the interference range of primary users is limited, multiple clusters in the CRN may not share a common sparse spectrum, and thus, the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm may not be appropriate to handle all clusters in CS inversion. Hence, we propose a novel multitask spectrum-sensing method based on spatiotemporal data mining methods. In each cluster, we assume that the spectrum sensing is executed in a synchronized way. The cluster head (CH) manages the operations, and a common sparseness hyperparameter is used to make a consensus decision. Among multiple clusters, synchronized CS sampling is not required in our scheme; instead, the Dirichlet process prior is employed to make an automatic grouping of the spectrum-sensing results among different clusters with a common sparseness hyperparameter shared inside each group. To exploit the time-domain relevance among consecutive CS observations, a hidden Markov model is employed to describe the relationship between the hidden subcarrier states and the consecutive CS observations, and the Viterbi algorithm is used to make an accurate spectrum decision for each secondary user. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can successfully exploit the spatiotemporal relationship to achieve higher spectrum-sensing performance in terms of normalized mean square error, probability of correct detection, and probability of false alarm, compared with a few other related works.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2223767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","startPage":"809","endPage":"823","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06328291.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitask Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks via Spatiotemporal Data Mining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multitask Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks via Spatiotemporal Data Mining","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13307161","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitask Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks via Spatiotemporal Data Mining","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2223767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052084S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","articleId":"6328291","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328295,"authors":[{"name":"Tanya Lee Ann Crenshaw","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Portland, Portland, OR, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tanya Lee Ann Crenshaw (M'94) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Portland, Portland, OR, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 2008.","She is an Assistant Professor of computer science with the School of Engineering, University of Portland."]},"firstName":"Tanya Lee Ann","lastName":"Crenshaw","id":"37566147400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9359"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9638"}],"articleNumber":"6328295","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1162},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Education Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/es/"}],"abstract":"Cyber-physical systems are a genre of networked real-time systems that monitor and control the physical world.

Unfortunately, even if several well-established techniques are available in the literature for the cross-coupled or extracted-pole synthesis taken separately, nothing can be found for the design of mixed topology filters (apart direct optimization). In this study, two solutions for the synthesis of a low-pass prototype with a mixed topology are presented, which noticeably increases the design flexibility of narrowband microwave filters. Several examples are presented for illustrating the proposed techniques for the synthesis of mixed-topology prototype filters.

Conventional cycle-based lifetime models can then be applied directly to provide information about the life consumption of the products. The use of an off-line rainflow algorithm is a common solution for arbitrary loads, but it cannot be applied in real time in its original form. This paper presents an in-line coding algorithm which uses a stack-based implementation, and a recursive algorithm to pick out the equivalent full and half cycles of the irregular load profile. The method can be integrated easily within time-domain or serial data applications to generate equivalent full and half cycles as they occur. Thus it is of particular significance for life estimation in real-time applications where use of the traditional implementations of the counting algorithm is impractical. In comparison with the off-line traditional rainflow method, the on-line method doesn't require any knowledge of the time history of the load profile because it processes each minimum or maximum when it occurs. Therefore, it provides a more efficient cycle counting method using less memory storage, and making more efficient use of computational resources within the real-time environment.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2012.2221040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/6362257/06328300.pdf","startPage":"978","endPage":"986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2012.2221040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Implementation of the Rainflow Counting Algorithm for Life Consumption Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Implementation of the Rainflow Counting Algorithm for Life Consumption Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328300/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13146759","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328300/","volume":"61","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Implementation of the Rainflow Counting Algorithm for Life Consumption Estimation","sourcePdf":"tr-musallam-2221040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094739S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"6362257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6362257","articleId":"6328300","onlineDate":"10 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6328322,"authors":[{"name":"Henrik Klessig","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Henrik","lastName":"Klessig","id":"38016182800"},{"name":"Albrecht Fehske","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Albrecht","lastName":"Fehske","id":"37564059200"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"},{"name":"Jens Voigt","affiliation":["Actix GmbH, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Voigt","id":"37357138100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328322","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":432},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Optimization","Signal to noise ratio","Joints","Load modeling","Computer architecture","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load conditions","antenna tilts adaptation","cell selection rules","mobile networks","SON technology","SON coordination","closed-loop SON","mobility load balancing","mobility robustness optimization","capacity and coverage optimization","CCO algorithms","MLB algorithms","LTE real deployment scenario","optimization concepts","antenna tilt settings","cell selection policies","spectral efficiency","energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SON","self-optimization","closed-loop optimization","LTE","wireless network planning and optimization","SON coordination"]}],"abstract":"One major topic of research into SON technology is the coordination of SON use cases. Network operators expect a coordinated handling of the parameter and configuration changes submitted to the operating network by closed-loop SON use case implementations. Beside a published conceptual framework, SON coordination has already been treated in the literature, especially regarding the mobility load balancing (MLB) and mobility robustness optimization (MRO) use cases. In this paper, we utilize the capacity and coverage optimization (CCO) and MLB use cases. Rather than performing any heading or tailing coordination of separate CCO and MLB algorithms, in our work we concentrate on the optimization considering both use cases in a joint algorithm. Our approach introduces cell-individual loads and the joint treatment of cell selection policies and antenna tilt settings into well-known and previously reported optimization concepts. Using system simulations of a sample LTE real deployment scenario, we verify that our joint optimization of antenna tilts and cell selection rules including the notion of cell-individual loads outperforms the optimization of tilts-only (with and without the notion of cell-individual loads within the algorithm) and of the cell selection rules-only in terms of spectral and energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328322","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328322.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328322","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving coverage and load conditions through joint adaptation of antenna tilts and cell selection rules in mobile networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improving coverage and load conditions through joint adaptation of antenna tilts and cell selection rules in mobile networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328322/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328322/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114893","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving coverage and load conditions through joint adaptation of antenna tilts and cell selection rules in mobile networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0021Klessig.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044863S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328327,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Amirijoo","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Amirijoo","id":"37564259600"},{"name":"Zhi Chai","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Chai","id":"38494705200"},{"name":"P\u00e5l Frenger","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"P\u00e5l","lastName":"Frenger","id":"37348438200"},{"name":"Birgitta Olin","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Birgitta","lastName":"Olin","id":"38494039200"},{"name":"Johan Moe","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Moe","id":"37717711200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328327","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Energy consumption","Delay","Telecommunication traffic","Transmitting antennas","Loaded antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","energy consumption","mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-optimizing antenna muting","energy consumption","user thoughput analysis","mobile networks","3G networks","radio access network","cost efficiency","antenna deactivation","dynamic simulator","Western European city","radio units","adaptive activation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Efficiency","Mobile Networks","Energy Consumption","Radio unit de-activation","antenna muting","MIMO adaptation","EARTH"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328327","abstract":"Energy consumption in mobile networks, e.g. 3G networks, may be a substantial part of an operator's expenses. A large part of the total energy of the network is consumed by the radio access network. Today operators are saving energy by turning off carriers or cells during periods with low traffic by manually configuring on-off periods. At the same time, operators are seeking to increase cost efficiency through simplifying network management processes by means of automation. In this paper we address energy saving by introducing an approach that automatically and without operator involvement deactivates radio units during periods with low load. We demonstrate the benefits of antenna deactivation using a dynamic simulator and a realistic deployment based on a major Western European city. The results presented suggest that there is potential for significantly enhancing the energy efficiency in mobile networks by adaptive activation of radio units.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328327","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328327.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-optimizing antenna muting - energy consumption and user thoughput analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Self-optimizing antenna muting - energy consumption and user thoughput analysis","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328327/","accessionNumber":"13114898","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328327/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-optimizing antenna muting - energy consumption and user thoughput analysis","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0046Amirijoo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045122S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6328328,"authors":[{"name":"Youssif Fawzi Sharkasi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Youssif Fawzi","lastName":"Sharkasi","id":"38468085100"},{"name":"Des McLernon","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Des","lastName":"McLernon","id":"37285107700"},{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37284467100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328328","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","frequency selective surfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","cognitive radio energy detector","flat-fading channel","frequency-selective fading channel","computer simulations","detection probability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a cognitive radio energy detector over frequency-selective channels","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328328.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328328","startPage":"51","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328328","abstract":"Previous work on an energy detector (ED) has only analytically examined its performance over a flat-fading channel.

So in this paper we evaluate the performance of an ED over a frequency-selective fading channel. We show that the performance of the ED might improve because of the multipath environment. The average detection probability for the ED over a frequency-selective channel is evaluated analytically and validated through simulation. Further, the outage probability is derived theoretically and supported by computer simulations. The results confirm that there is a significant improvement in the performance of the ED over the frequency-selective fading channel compared with the flat-fading channel. Finally, we show that the detection probability rapidly improves with initial increases in the number of multipaths but later flattens out.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13114899","htmlLink":"/document/6328328/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a cognitive radio energy detector over frequency-selective channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a cognitive radio energy detector over frequency-selective channels","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0051Sharkasi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094517S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328330,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Lu\u00eds","affiliation":["CTS, UNINOVA, Department de Engineeringa Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Portugal"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Lu\u00eds","id":"37411990500"},{"name":"Ant\u00f3nio Furtado","affiliation":["CTS, UNINOVA, Department de Engineeringa Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ant\u00f3nio","lastName":"Furtado","id":"38256375900"},{"name":"Rodolfo Oliveira","affiliation":["CTS, UNINOVA, Department de Engineeringa Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"37391106800"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["CTS, UNINOVA, Department de Engineeringa Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"},{"name":"Luis Bernardo","affiliation":["CTS, UNINOVA, Department de Engineeringa Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Bernardo","id":"37391503500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328330","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328330","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Equations","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy sensing parameterization criteria","cognitive radios","energy-based sensing","EBS","interference","secondary users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Sensing","Cognitive Radio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328330","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328330.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy sensing parameterization criteria for cognitive radios","abstract":"Energy-based sensing (EBS) has been a topic of strong research in the last years due to its importance to Cognitive Radios (CRs).

However, the ED does not work well in the presence of noise power uncertainty. So we study sensing-throughput tradeoff by using an autocorrelation detector (AD) for an OFDM signal. In this paper, we derive a closed form expression for the false alarm probability over both Nakagami-m and Rician fading channels. This false alarm probability relies upon a new threshold which takes into account an outage constraint on the probability of detection due to fading environments. The results show that the throughput improves with an increase in the Nakagami-m fading parameter and the Rician factor. In addition, the throughput improves dramatically with an initial increase of the number of multipath and then levels out.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328331","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328331.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing-throughput tradeoff for OFDM-based cognitive radio under outage constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328331/","displayDocTitle":"Sensing-throughput tradeoff for OFDM-based cognitive radio under outage constraints","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114902","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328331/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing-throughput tradeoff for OFDM-based cognitive radio under outage constraints","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0066Sharkasi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.155834S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328332,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Tang","affiliation":["BCNG, College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37595822400"},{"name":"Lijie Wang","affiliation":["Beijing AeroSpace Control Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lijie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37600190800"},{"name":"David Grace","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Grace","id":"37269106100"},{"name":"Jibo Wei","affiliation":["BCNG, College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jibo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279094700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328332","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328332","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Games","Relays","Quality of service","Ad hoc networks","Pricing","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum leasing","cognitive radio networks","primary user","secondary user","QoS","spectrum renting","pricing","cognitive radio systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328332","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328332.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility based cooperative spectrum leasing in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a cooperative spectrum leasing scheme for cognitive radio networks, in which both the primary user (PU) and the secondary user (SU) target to maximize their individual utility.

The objective is to find a distributed solution that maximizes the network utility with limited information. We consider two different criteria to define this network utility: the number of flows that can be established in the network and the aggregate capacity in bps of the established flows. We propose three different games to address this problem: a local flow game based on complete information about the links of the flow, a potential flow game which needs overall network information and a cooperative link game only requiring partial information about the links of the flow. We introduce the required modifications in the local flow and the cooperative link game definitions to ensure their convergence. Results show that the proposed games adapt to the considered network utility definitions. In addition, the cooperative link game highly decreases the complexity of the flow allocation problems with a performance similar to that of the local and potential flow games.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328336","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328336","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow allocation with joint channel and power assignment in multihop cognitive radio networks using game theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Flow allocation with joint channel and power assignment in multihop cognitive radio networks using game theory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328336/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328336/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114907","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow allocation with joint channel and power assignment in multihop cognitive radio networks using game theory","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0091Gallego.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057863S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328339,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Sant'Anna Chaves","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bras\u00edlia-UnB, Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel Sant'Anna","lastName":"Chaves","id":"38495197100"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Noll Barreto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bras\u00edlia-UnB, Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9 Noll","lastName":"Barreto","id":"38241990300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328339","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Energy states","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Cognitive radio","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","modulation","numerical analysis","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detection spectrum sensing","M-ary QAM systems","AWGN channels","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","detection probability","numerical simulations","SNR levels","modulation scheme","sensing performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Detection","unknown signal detection","QAM systems","energy distribution"]}],"abstract":"This article addresses energy detection for spectrum sensing of M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) systems.

The solution maximizing SLNR is obtained by a generalized eigen-decomposition with a pair of covariance matrices of desired signal and leakage plus noise. It is burdensome to calculate directly a generalized eigenvector at each time step in time-varying channels. To reduce the computational complexity in the beam design algorithm, the perturbation theory for a generalized eigenvector without any iteration is used for a simple update formula to obtain a new generalized eigenvector corresponding to the updated channel information.

The proposed method is applicable when some of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) feedback between the user equipment and the respective BSs is missing if the path loss between the user equipment and BS is higher than a predetermined threshold. The proposed method alleviates the loss in the transmitter diversity (beam forming) gain caused by the perfect nulling of inter-user interference in BD. By allowing the inter-user interference from a link that has a high average path loss, the overall throughput performance of simple BD is enhanced. We show that the combination of layered transmission that restricts the set of BSs used for the signal transmission and adaptive control of interference admission significantly increases the throughput of BS cooperative multiuser MIMO with partial CSI feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive interference admission control for layered partially nonorthogonal block diagonalization for base station cooperative MIMO","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328349","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328349.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive interference admission control for layered partially nonorthogonal block diagonalization for base station cooperative MIMO","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328349/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114920","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive interference admission control for layered partially nonorthogonal block diagonalization for base station cooperative MIMO","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0156Oshima.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045773S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328351,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Nikitopoulos","affiliation":["Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Nikitopoulos","id":"37284781800"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328351","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Decoding","Encoding","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","MIMO communication","radio receivers","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simple complexity adjustment technique","soft MIMO receivers","broadcasting scenarios","multiple-input multiple-output broadcasting scenarios","spatial multiplexing","diverse transmission environments","unfavorable transmission conditions","transmission scenarios","error-rate performance","a posteriori probability","APP receivers","multiple-input multiple-output channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","soft-output detection","sphere decoding"]}],"abstract":"In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcasting scenarios with spatial multiplexing, different users may experience diverse transmission environments. While users experiencing \u201cunfavorable\u201d transmission conditions employ advanced, soft receiver processing to achieve the required error-rate performance, it is a significant waste of resources (e.g., energy, latency) for users operating under good transmission scenarios. In order to avoid this unnecessary processing a very simple but efficient technique is proposed to adjust the receiver processing requirements to the transmission scenario and the targeted error-rate performance, without necessitating the exact relationship between complexity and performance. It applies aposteriori probability (APP) receivers operating over multiple-input multiple-output channels and it can provide significant complexity savings with only minor modifications on the originally proposed receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple complexity adjustment technique for soft MIMO receivers in broadcasting scenarios","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328351","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328351.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A simple complexity adjustment technique for soft MIMO receivers in broadcasting scenarios","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328351/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114922","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple complexity adjustment technique for soft MIMO receivers in broadcasting scenarios","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0166Nikitopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048942S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328352,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Michailow","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Michailow","id":"38228624200"},{"name":"Ivan Gaspar","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Gaspar","id":"38491799700"},{"name":"Stefan Krone","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Krone","id":"37529375200"},{"name":"Michael Lentmaier","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lentmaier","id":"37283339900"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328352","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2596},"abstract":"Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is a new concept that can be seen as a generalization of traditional OFDM.

As a consequence the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced as well as the length of the training sequence.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328356.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured subchannel impulse response estimation for Filter Bank based Multicarrier systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","channel estimation","frequency selective surfaces","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structured subchannel impulse response estimation","multicarrier systems","filter bank based multicarrier system","FBMC system","frequency selective propagation channel","multitap impulse response","subchannel IR estimation","propagation channel","structured channel estimation","receive filters","transmit filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Structured subchannel impulse response estimation for Filter Bank based Multicarrier systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114927","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured subchannel impulse response estimation for Filter Bank based Multicarrier systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0191Baltar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107158S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328357,"authors":[{"name":"Anas M.

We derive exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the symbol error rate (SER) for the Rayleigh and Nakagami-m cases, and accurate approximations for the case of Rician distributed interferers' channels. Both, the independent non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) and independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) cases of interferers' channels have been considered in this paper. Furthermore, a look into the asymptotical high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance has been taken and the diversity order and coding gain of the proposed fading environments are compared. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulations are provided to validate the analytical and asymptotic results and to illustrate the effect of interference on the system performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Wireless communication","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel coding","cochannel interference","diversity reception","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward relay system","interference-limited destination","fading environments","dual-hop fixed-gain AF relay system","Rayleigh distribution","Rayleigh channel","Nakagami-m channel","Rician channel","outage probability","symbol error rate","independent nonidentically distributed interferer channel","independent identically distributed interferer channel","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR performance","diversity order","coding gain","Monte Carlo simulations","cochannel interference","CCI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay","amplify-and-forward","dual-hop networks","co-channel interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328357","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328357.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of amplify-and-forward relay system with interference-limited destination in different fading environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of amplify-and-forward relay system with interference-limited destination in different fading environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328357/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328357/","accessionNumber":"13114928","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of amplify-and-forward relay system with interference-limited destination in different fading environments","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0196Salhab.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079628S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6328359,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Mortazawi Molu","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Mortazawi Molu","id":"37087968131"},{"name":"Norbert Goertz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Goertz","id":"37295153600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328359","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328359","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Fading","Receivers","Channel models","Probability density function","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","diversity reception","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward relaying systems","channel model","outage behaviour","receiver output SNR","source-to-relay-to-destination link","probability density function","cumulative distribution function","outage probability","relay transmission","source transmission","maximal ratio combining technique","AF relaying system"]}],"abstract":"Characteristic of receiver output SNR associated with Source-to-Relay-to-Destination link for Amplify and forward relaying systems is studied and theoretical expressions for probability density function and cumulative distribution function are derived. Thereby, closed-form solution for outage probability of the system is derived. The analysis is then extended to a scenario where the destination combines the signals corresponding to the source and the relay transmissions using maximal ratio combining technique. The statistics of the equivalent SNR is studied and some new closed form expressions at high SNR regime are derived. The comparison of theoretical and numerical results shows that the high SNR expressions for outage probability are adequately tight in low SNR too. The performance of the AF relaying system is further investigated at low SNR regime; the results show that at low SNR regime, the relay transmission does not play role on the the performance of the overall system, therefore, spending resources (e.g. power or bandwidth) for the relay transmission is only wasting the resources whereas at high SNR regime the relay transmission provides full diversity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328359","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328359.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"210","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify and forward relaying; Channel model and outage behaviour","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Amplify and forward relaying; Channel model and outage behaviour","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328359/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114930","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify and forward relaying; Channel model and outage behaviour","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0206Molu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04704S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6328363,"authors":[{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","id":"38240583100"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"},{"name":"Alister G.

In the proposed method, enumeration schemes can be avoided once the best partial path metrics (PPMs) fail to satisfy the constraint obtained by the MPTP for a given layer. In addition, the SIC provides a simple method to obtain the possible best candidate for each layer. This strategy effectively eliminates the extra branches without enumeration, if no candidates are available for each layer. Simulations illustrate that the proposed algorithm can reach near-maximum likelihood (ML) performance with a reduction in computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328363/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13114934","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328363/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Complex sphere decoding with a modified tree pruning and successive interference cancellation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex sphere decoding with a modified tree pruning and successive interference cancellation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0226Li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071483S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328365,"authors":[{"name":"Houcem Gazzah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Houcem","lastName":"Gazzah","id":"37284753800"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Delmas","affiliation":["UMR CNRS 5157, Telecom and Management Sud Paris, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Delmas","id":"37284991500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328365","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Blind equalizers","Complexity theory","Correlation","Receiving antennas","Compaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","equalisers","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace blind MIMO channel equalization","quadratic complexity","SOS-based blind equalization algorithm","SIMO channel","channel memory","SOS-based techniques","observation conditions"]}],"abstract":"An SOS-based blind equalization algorithm for the SIMO channel has recently been proposed that has an unprecedented quadratic complexity in the channel memory, compared to all existing SOS-based techniques whose complexity is cubic in this regard.

Although non-orthogonal access employing the MMSE-SIC achieves the entire region of the multiuser capacity in a multiple access channel (MAC), which should be beneficial in enhancing the total user throughput and cell-edge user throughput simultaneously compared to orthogonal access, the multiplexing of multiple users within the same frequency block increases the inter-cell interference in the context of the cellular uplink. The aim of the transmission power control method investigated in this paper is to mitigate the inter-cell interference increase due to non-orthogonal user multiplexing. We employ a weighted proportional fair (PF)-based multiuser scheduling scheme to achieve a good tradeoff between the total user throughput and cell-edge user throughput. Simulation results show that non-orthogonal access employing the MMSE-SIC using the proposed transmission power control significantly enhances the system-level throughput performance compared to orthogonal access, which is widely used in 3.9 and 4G mobile communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328370/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13114941","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328370/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Uplink non-orthogonal access with MMSE-SIC in the presence of inter-cell interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink non-orthogonal access with MMSE-SIC in the presence of inter-cell interference","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0261Endo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076222S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328375,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Anchora","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering (DEI), University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Anchora","id":"37295729600"},{"name":"Leonardo Badia","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering (DEI), University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Badia","id":"37275350000"},{"name":"Eleftherios Karipidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Eleftherios","lastName":"Karipidis","id":"37394029700"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering (DEI), University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37278668800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328375","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":450},"abstract":"Static spectrum allocation leads to resource wastage and inter-operator spectrum sharing is a possible way to improve spectrum efficiency. In this work, we assume that two cellular network operators agree upon sharing part of their spectrum, which can then be dynamically accessed by either of them in a mutually exclusive way.

Hence, we propose a centralized algorithm that performs coordinated scheduling, in order to numerically evaluate an upper bound on the achievable sum capacity. The algorithm is centralized and exploits complete information on both networks to perform the optimum allocation. The simulation results illustrate the impact of the multiuser diversity and the asymmetry in the traffic load among the networks on the overall achievable gain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","OFDM","Interference","Upper bound","Scheduling algorithms","Femtocells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","diversity reception","Long Term Evolution","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity gains","orthogonal spectrum sharing","multioperator LTE cellular networks","static spectrum allocation","interoperator spectrum sharing","spectrum efficiency","cellular network operators","centralized algorithm","upper bound","coordinated scheduling","sum capacity","multiuser diversity","traffic load","resource wastage allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sharing","resource allocation","OFDMA","LTE downlink","multi-operator networks","multiuser diversity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328375","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328375.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity gains due to orthogonal spectrum sharing in multi-operator LTE cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity gains due to orthogonal spectrum sharing in multi-operator LTE cellular networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328375/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328375/","accessionNumber":"13114946","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity gains due to orthogonal spectrum sharing in multi-operator LTE cellular networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0286Anchora.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092386S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6328376,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Luo","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Luo","id":"37537083200"},{"name":"Johannes Lindblom","affiliation":["Communication Systems Division, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Lindblom","id":"37411638300"},{"name":"Jianhui Li","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Li","id":"37538152800"},{"name":"Rami Mochaoura","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Mochaoura"},{"name":"Andreas Kortke","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kortke","id":"37318564900"},{"name":"Eleftherios Karipidis","affiliation":["Communication Systems Division, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Eleftherios","lastName":"Karipidis","id":"37394029700"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"},{"name":"Eduard Jorswieck","affiliation":["Communications Laboratory, Communications Theory, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Jorswieck","id":"37275005700"},{"name":"Erik G.

After a brief description of the BF techniques in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, their computational complexity is analyzed. The effectiveness of these techniques in real radio frequency (RF) signal transmission is verified by implementation on a flexible hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed. First, several important aspects regarding practical implementation are discussed. Afterwards, the HIL measurement results are shown, where considerable sum rate gain can be observed due to spectrum sharing. Finally, the appropriate BF technique can be chosen based on a tradeoff between complexity and performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","startPage":"291","endPage":"295","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328376.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beamforming for inter-operator spectrum sharing: From theory to practice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328376/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming for inter-operator spectrum sharing: From theory to practice","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114947","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming for inter-operator spectrum sharing: From theory to practice","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0291Luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065253S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328378,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Guib\u00e8ne","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Guib\u00e8ne","id":"37596570600"},{"name":"Dirk Slock","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Slock","id":"37079237600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328378","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Source separation","Sensors","Vectors","Image edge detection","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","probability","radiofrequency interference","signal classification","signal detection","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","spectrum sharing","spectral resources","spectrum access policies","communication rules","spectrum bands","fusion center","interfering signal elimination","mixed signal separation-classification algorithm","frequency band location","hostile terminal","detection probability","classification probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mixed signal separation","cognitive radio","signals classification","spectrum sharing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal separation and classification algorithm for cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328378","startPage":"301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328378","abstract":"In the context of spectrum sharing, many approaches were developed and many algorithms were proposed in order to model and regulate the use of spectral resources.

To enable the widespread of femtocells coexisting with macrocells, smart interference management schemes are required. Interference management by frequency allocation is still a big challenge in hybrid macro/femto cellular networks. Arbitrary frequency allocation schemes may have detrimental effects on the overall system spectral efficiency and coverage. In this paper, we propose soft and partial frequency reuse schemes for interference management in LTE femtocell networks. We analyze the system performance with various frequency allocation schemes via different metrics such as throughput, quality of service (QoS) and fairness.

However, the direct application of the D2D communication can cause harmful interference to the cellular network. Therein, power control algorithms become essential tools to keep interference controlled and to ensure improved system performance. In this paper, we study two power control strategies for D2D communication within Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) cellular networks. In the first strategy, each user achieves a certain target Signal to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) while minimizing the total transmit power. In the second one, the target SINR varies with user's transmit power. Simulation results show that system capacity can be improved only if D2D communication and power control are appropriately combined.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328385","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328385.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of power control for device-to-device communication in cellular MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328385/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of power control for device-to-device communication in cellular MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114956","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328385/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of power control for device-to-device communication in cellular MIMO systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0336Rego.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088632S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328388,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Schedler","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, University of Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Schedler","id":"38234539900"},{"name":"Andre Angierski","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, University of Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Angierski","id":"38234539400"},{"name":"Volker Kuehn","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, University of Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Kuehn","id":"37530885800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328388","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"This work analyses a multi-user relay network with orthogonal channel access using OFDMA.

For the first stage, a frequency domain equalizer applying the minimum mean-squared error criterion is used to mitigate the intersymbol interference introduced by the channel's non-flat frequency response. Following, the output of this frequency domain equalizer, assumed to be intersymbol interference free, is used as an input for a sphere detector. The sphere detector then processes its input, returning log-likelihood ratios for all transmitted bits from all transmitting antennas. These log-likelihood ratios can be used, for instance, as inputs for decoders following the sphere detector in the receiving chain. The proposed method is shown to be well suited for the uplink scenario of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced standard, where high-modulation order signals can be transmitted by multiple antennas using a single-carrier frequency division multiplexing access (SC-FDMA) scheme that is prone to suffer from the effects of intersymbol interference.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328396","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328396.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-stage detector for SC-FDMA transmission over MIMO ISI channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328396/","displayDocTitle":"Two-stage detector for SC-FDMA transmission over MIMO ISI channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114967","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328396/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-stage detector for SC-FDMA transmission over MIMO ISI channels","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0391Jar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05338S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328397,"authors":[{"name":"Raymundo Nogueira de S\u00e1 Netto","affiliation":["Wrreless Telecommunications Research Group, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil"],"firstName":"Raymundo Nogueira","lastName":"de S\u00e1 Netto","id":"38494542600"},{"name":"Charles Casimiro Cavalcante","affiliation":["Wrreless Telecommunications Research Group, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil"],"firstName":"Charles Casimiro","lastName":"Cavalcante","id":"37284661400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328397","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","MIMO","Computational modeling","Silicon compounds","Quantization","Memory management","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","error statistics","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise impact","feedback reduction","compressive sensing","spatially multiplexed MIMO systems","channel state information","zero forcing linear signal detection technique","quantization codebook","CSI feedback","bit error rate","BER curves","quantization error","quantization noise"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we analyze spatially multiplexed MIMO systems with limited Channel State Information (CSI) and zero forcing (ZF) linear signal detection technique.

Various methods for implementing distributed beamforming in wireless ad hoc networks have been considered before, but little research has been conducted so far in the connection initialization and cluster identification necessary for realizing such communication in practice. We address these issues with the aim of facilitating communication between terminals in separate clusters too far apart for direct signaling. The proposed approach is based on assigning a specific identification code for each cluster, and utilizing this with distributed beamforming to establish links between clusters. This approach can be used also for sharing the spectrum within a limited geographical area between several clusters of wireless terminals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328403/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13114974","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328403/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed beamforming for inter-cluster communication in ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed beamforming for inter-cluster communication in ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0426Hurnanen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071027S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328404,"authors":[{"name":"Jari Tissari","affiliation":["BID Technology, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Tissari","id":"37391712200"},{"name":"Tero Hurnanen","affiliation":["Turun Yliopisto, Turku, FI"],"firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Hurnanen"},{"name":"Jussi Poikonen","affiliation":["BID Technology, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Poikonen","id":"37287483100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328404","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose and analyse an adaptive algorithm for distributed beamforming in OFDM systems over time and frequency selective channel conditions.

We propose the division of the problem into relaying and precoding problems and use this decoupling to apply precoding algorithms available in the literature to the problem of maximizing the minimum user SNR in the relayed system without algorithm specific changes. Next, we study three different relaying schemes representing: the classic setup without using the relay, a combination of the signal from the direct and relayed paths using Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) and an iterative algorithm that performs precoding and MRC in sequence. Finally, the results show that the proposed schemes are able to increase the system throughput even at the expense of an additional transmission phase. In addition, the performance of the proposed iterative scheme was shown not to depend significantly on the underlying precoding algorithms, which leads to the conclusion that the relaying problem solution has a higher impact on the overall performance than the precoding problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328405/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13114976","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328405/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming and diversity techniques in multicast systems with a single relay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming and diversity techniques in multicast systems with a single relay","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0436Santos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043772S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328406,"authors":[{"name":"Lazar Berbakov","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Lazar","lastName":"Berbakov","id":"38274965800"},{"name":"Javier Matamoros","affiliation":["Centre Tecnolgic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Matamoros","id":"38273029700"},{"name":"Carles Ant\u00f3n-Haro","affiliation":["Centre Tecnolgic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Carles","lastName":"Ant\u00f3n-Haro","id":"38272518500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328406","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Batteries","Throughput","Resource management","Optimization","Array signal processing","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","convex programming","energy harvesting","telecommunication power supplies","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmission policy","distributed beamforming","energy harvesting sensor","battery-operated sensor nodes","base station","power allocation","convex optimization problem","computer simulations"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a scenario where one energy harvesting and one battery operated sensor cooperatively transmit a common message to a distant base station.

As benchmarks, we consider a system with a single energy harvesting sensor and, also, a scenario where the optimal transmission policy for the single-sensor case is adopted by both sensors.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328406","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328406.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328406","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","startPage":"441","endPage":"445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal transmission policy for distributed beamforming with energy harvesting and battery operated sensor nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal transmission policy for distributed beamforming with energy harvesting and battery operated sensor nodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328406/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328406/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114977","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal transmission policy for distributed beamforming with energy harvesting and battery operated sensor nodes","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0441Berbakov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054643S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6328407,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Guti\u00e9rrez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"Guti\u00e9rrez","id":"37347616800"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","id":"37285060300"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37274274400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328407","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","correlation methods","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial correlation beamforming scheme","MISO channel emulation","temporal correlation","mobile wireless channel characteristics","multiple-input multiple-output system performance","MIMO techniques","wireless channels","multiple-input single-output channel","time-varying beamforming","controlled channel conditions","commercial MIMO test bed"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial correlation beamforming scheme for MISO channel emulation","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","endPage":"450","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328407","startPage":"446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328407","abstract":"Temporal and spatial correlation are inherent mobile wireless channel characteristics that determine multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems performance.

The purpose of this study is to examine the possibility of applying non-orthogonal access with a SIC to the systems beyond the 4G (thus IMT-Advanced) cellular system. Both the total and cell-edge average user throughput are important in a real system. PF-based scheduling is known to achieve a good tradeoff by maximizing the product of the average user throughput among users within a cell. In non-orthogonal access with a SIC, the scheduler allocates the same frequency to multiple users, which necessitates multiuser scheduling. To achieve a better tradeoff between the total and cell-edge average user throughput, we propose and compare three power allocation strategies among users, which are jointly implemented with multiuser scheduling. Extensive simulation results show that non-orthogonal access with a SIC with a moderate number of non-orthogonally multiplexed users significantly enhances the system-level throughput performance compared to orthogonal access, which is widely used in 3.9 and 4G mobile communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328413","startPage":"476","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328413.pdf","endPage":"480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328413/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of non-orthogonal access with SIC in cellular downlink using proportional fair-based resource allocation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328413/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13114984","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of non-orthogonal access with SIC in cellular downlink using proportional fair-based resource allocation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0476Otao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050731S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328414,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Clarke","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Clarke","id":"37283716900"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328414","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","conjugate gradient methods","fading channels","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","spread spectrum communication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive bidirectional MMSE algorithm","interference suppression","DS-CDMA systems","fast fading channels","adaptive bidirectional minimum mean-square error parameter estimation algorithm","time correlation","successive channel gains","tracking capabilities","bidirectional normalized least mean-square algorithm","conjugate gradient algorithm","bidirectional NLMS algorithm","CG algorithm","adaptive mixing parameters","time-varying channel correlation properties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional signal processing","adaptive interference suppression","fast-fading channels","adaptive receivers"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents adaptive bidirectional minimum mean-square error (MMSE) parameter estimation algorithms for fast-fading channels.

However, the requirement of prohibitively high sampling rates to monitor a wideband, makes this a challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel wideband spectrum sensing model that reduces the sampling requirement to a sub-Nyquist rate, proportional to the number of occupied channels in the wideband spectrum. The sampling scheme is efficiently implementable using low-rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The sensing algorithm uses techniques borrowed from theoretical computer science and compressive sampling, to detect the occupied channels with a high probability of success. The algorithm is implementable for spectrum sensing in a single CR, as well as in a decentralized CR-network with minimal communication between one-hop neighbors. We provide theoretical expressions for probability of detection and run-time requirements of the scheme. Our simulations show that the proposed scheme exhibits a performance similar to a Nyquist-rate energy detector, even with low SNR conditions and high under-sampling factors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","startPage":"531","endPage":"535","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328424.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive, collaborative spectrum sensing for wideband Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328424/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive, collaborative spectrum sensing for wideband Cognitive Radios","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13114995","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive, collaborative spectrum sensing for wideband Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0531Yenduri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078114S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328426,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37589263100"},{"name":"Ayman Assra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Assra","id":"37392244900"},{"name":"Beno\u00eet Champagne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328426","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aggregates","Wideband","Joints","Interference","Throughput","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cognitive radio","Markov processes","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband joint detection","correlated spectral occupancy","wideband cognitive radios","wideband spectrum sensing","frequency dependent detection thresholds","opportunistic throughput","cognitive radio","CR networks","frequency-decoupled detector structure","frequency-coupled optimum linear energy combiner","OLEC structure","subband occupancy correlation","single-user OLEC","interference constraints","Markov model","CR performance","decoupled multiband processing structure"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiband joint detection with correlated spectral occupancy in wideband cognitive radios","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","endPage":"545","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328426.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328426","startPage":"541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328426","abstract":"Recently, a wideband spectrum sensing scheme referred to as multiband joint detection has been proposed by Quan et al., in which a set of frequency dependent detection thresholds are optimized to achieve the best trade-off between aggregate measures of opportunistic throughput and interference to primary users in cognitive radio (CR) networks. While this scheme shows significant performance gains over benchmark approaches, it employs a frequency-decoupled detector structure that is not optimal in the presence of correlation between subband occupancies, a common situation in CR applications. In this paper, we investigate how a frequency-coupled optimum linear energy combiner (OLEC) structure, recently proposed for single user scenarios, can be integrated into the above multiband joint detection framework to take further advantage of subband occupancy correlation in wideband spectrum sensing. We first analyze the performance of the single-user OLEC and derive expressions for its probabilities of false alarm and missed detection. Using these expressions, we then formulate joint optimization problems for the detection thresholds used by a bank of subband OLECs, with the aim to maximize the aggregate opportunistic throughput under interference constraints. Through numerical experiments with a Markov model of subband occupancy, we show that the use of the OLEC in wideband spectrum sensing can significantly enhance CR performance in terms of these global metrics, when compared to the decoupled multiband processing structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13114997","htmlLink":"/document/6328426/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiband joint detection with correlated spectral occupancy in wideband cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiband joint detection with correlated spectral occupancy in wideband cognitive radios","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0541Hossain.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08775S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328427,"authors":[{"name":"Tachporn Sanguanpuak","affiliation":["Telecommunications Field of Study, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tachporn","lastName":"Sanguanpuak","id":"37680349500"},{"name":"Nandana Rajatheva","affiliation":["Telecommunications Field of Study, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand","Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Nandana","lastName":"Rajatheva","id":"37332381600"},{"name":"Attaphongse Taparugssanagorn","affiliation":["Telecommunications Field of Study, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand","Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Attaphongse","lastName":"Taparugssanagorn","id":"37681325200"},{"name":"Hirley Alves","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Hirley","lastName":"Alves","id":"37721129600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328427","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MATLAB","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detector","iid Nakagami-m fading","relay-based cognitive radio networks","cooperative relay-based energy detection","two-hop cognitive relay","independent-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels","fusion center","lower-bound average detection probability","probability density function","PDF","end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio","exact average detection expression","canonical series representation","generalized Marcum-Q function","moment generating function","MGF","end-to-end SNR","single antenna","multiple antennas","Monte Carlo simulations","Mathematica program","MATLAB program","exact detection expressions"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we analyze the performance of cooperative relay based energy detection in cognitive radio.

In the presence of frequency-selective channels, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is typically used to deal with the multipath nature of the channel. While IA techniques can be applied in a per-subcarrier basis (post-FFT), the existence of symbol timing offsets (STOs) between the desired and the interfering OFDM symbols decreases the system performance dramatically. To solve this problem, we design pre-FFT precoders and decoders for single-beam MIMO IFCs for OFDM transmissions. Since the IA decoders operate before the FFT, they mitigate the interference before synchronization takes place. We show that our proposed scheme improves the system performance when STOs occur, in comparison with traditional post-FFT IA techniques. We provide simulation results to compare post and pre-FFT beamforming techniques and to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328429","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328429.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre- and post-FFT interference leakage minimization for MIMO OFDM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328429/","displayDocTitle":"Pre- and post-FFT interference leakage minimization for MIMO OFDM networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115000","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328429/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre- and post-FFT interference leakage minimization for MIMO OFDM networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0556Lameiro.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067175S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328430,"authors":[{"name":"Samer Bazzi","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Samer","lastName":"Bazzi","id":"38469453000"},{"name":"Guido Dietl","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Germany","University of Applied Sciences Landshut, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Dietl","id":"37266546100"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328430","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328430","abstract":"A novel interference alignment (IA) algorithm is presented. IA solutions can be obtained in closed-form for special cases only. In general, iterative algorithms need to be used. Most of these algorithms are based on a joint design of precoders at the transmitter side and receive filters at the receiver side, while the proposed method achieves IA with a precoder design only. A design based on precoders simplifies the problem structure and allows receive filters to be designed independently of the IA conditions. In case the channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT) is not perfectly known, IA cannot be completely achieved and the calculated precoders will result in degradation of achievable rates. An adapted receive filter design can help counteract the rate degradation and improve achievable rates as compared to a non-adapted receive filter design. The proposed solution is a good trade-off between required CSIT and achievable rates, as compared to state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","startPage":"561","endPage":"565","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328430.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference alignment with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Receivers","Transmitters","Channel estimation","Manifolds","Algorithm design and analysis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","interference suppression","iterative methods","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment algorithm","imperfect channel state information","IA algorithm","iterative algorithms","precoder design","channel state information-transmitter side","CSIT","adapted receive filter design","MIMO IC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Interference alignment with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328430/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328430/","accessionNumber":"13115001","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference alignment with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0561Bazzi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05015S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328431,"authors":[{"name":"Namyoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Namyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37403846100"},{"name":"Wonjae Shin","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Yongin, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonjae","lastName":"Shin","id":"37595072100"},{"name":"Robert W.

Incompleteness of CSIT is defined by the perfect knowledge of only a sub-matrix of the global channel matrix. Additionally, each Transmitter (TX) may have different incomplete CSIT. Most IA techniques are developed under a full (complete) CSIT assumption -either explicitly or implicitly when the CSI is progressively acquired in the form of RX-to-TX feedback iterations. In contrast, we are interested here in the feasibility of IA based only on incomplete CSIT. We show that even in antenna settings where no extra-antenna is available in terms of feasibility of IA, which we denote as tightly-feasible, IA can be achieved on some cases with some TXs having incomplete CSIT. Especially, for each antenna setting, we provide an incomplete CSIT sharing preserving feasibility and we adapt IA algorithms from the literature to achieve perfect IA under this condition of incomplete CSIT. We confirm by simulations that the proposed IA algorithm based on incomplete CSIT achieves no significant losses compared to the algorithm based on perfect CSIT sharing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO interference alignment algorithms with hierarchical CSIT","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328434","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328434.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MIMO interference alignment algorithms with hierarchical CSIT","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328434/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115005","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO interference alignment algorithms with hierarchical CSIT","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0581deKerret.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051391S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328437,"authors":[{"name":"Matthieu De Mari","affiliation":["Dept. of Telecommunications, SUPELEC, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"De Mari","id":"38494885800"},{"name":"Romain Couillet","affiliation":["Dept. of Telecommunications, SUPELEC, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Couillet","id":"37546137300"},{"name":"Emilio Calvanese Strinati","affiliation":["CEA Leti, France"],"firstName":"Emilio Calvanese","lastName":"Strinati","id":"38196073400"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbah","affiliation":["Dept. of Telecommunications, SUPELEC, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328437","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Equations","Mathematical model","Interference","Nash equilibrium","Trajectory","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data communication","game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent data transmissions","green wireless networks","cellular network","data packets","energy cost","instantaneous transmission","noncooperating transmission","power-efficient transmit policy","mean field game","Nash equilibrium","L-body dynamic game","optimal transmit power strategy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the scenario of a cellular network where base stations aim to transmit several data packets to a set of users in the downlink, within a predefined time, at minimal energy cost. The base stations are non-cooperating and the instantaneous transmission rate depends on the instantaneous SINR at the receiver. The purpose of this article is to highlight a power-efficient transmit policy. By assuming a large number of homogeneous users, we model the problem as a mean field game, with tractable equations, that allow us to bypass the complexity of analyzing a Nash equilibrium in a L-body dynamic game. The framework we propose yields a consistent analysis of the optimal transmit power strategy, that allows every base station to, selfishly but rationally, satisfy its transmission, at a minimal energy cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent data transmissions in green wireless networks: When best send one's packets?","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328437","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328437.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent data transmissions in green wireless networks: When best send one's packets?","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328437/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent data transmissions in green wireless networks: When best send one's packets?","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0596DeMari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051725S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6328440,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Peng","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Peng","id":"38236721600"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"},{"name":"Anke Schmeink","affiliation":["UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anke","lastName":"Schmeink","id":"37391595400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328440","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Protocols","Relays","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","amplify and forward communication","computational complexity","cooperative communication","error statistics","gradient methods","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive distributed space-time coding scheme","cooperative MIMO relaying systems","adaptive DSTC scheme","two-hop cooperative MIMO networks","linear minimum mean square error receivers","amplify-and-forward cooperation strategy","AF cooperation strategy","feedback channel","space-time coded matrix","relay node","linear MMSE expressions","adaptive matrix","linear receive filter","stochastic gradient algorithm","computational complexity reduction","error probability","randomized space-time coding scheme"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive distributed space-time coding (DSTC) scheme and algorithms are proposed for two-hop cooperative MIMO networks.

Thus, spatial processing can be applied both at the transmitters and at the relay, which is subject to optimization for increasing the data rates. In general, this optimization problem is non-convex and hard to solve. While in prior work on this problem, it is assumed that all transmitters access the channel jointly, we propose a solution where each transmitter accesses the channel exclusively, using a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) scheme. It is shown that this scheme provides higher achievable sum rates, which raises the question of the need for TDMA to achieve the general capacity region of MACs with AF relay.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328442.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superiority of TDMA in a class of Gaussian multiple-access channels with a MIMO-AF-relay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Covariance matrix","Time division multiple access","Joints","Transmitters","Receivers","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","concave programming","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDMA scheme","Gaussian multiple-access channels","MIMO-AF-relay","MAC","amplify-and-forward relay","receiver","multiple antennas","direct links","transmitters","receivers","spatial processing","data rates","nonconvex optimization problem","time-division multiple-access scheme","general capacity region"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Superiority of TDMA in a class of Gaussian multiple-access channels with a MIMO-AF-relay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328442/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115013","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superiority of TDMA in a class of Gaussian multiple-access channels with a MIMO-AF-relay","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0621Knabe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070266S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328443,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Alizadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Alizadeh","id":"38469621300"},{"name":"Ghosheh Abed Hodtani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ghosheh","lastName":"Abed Hodtani","id":"38494598200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328443","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Covariance matrix","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coverage region analysis","MIMO relay channel","optimal relay location","general Rayleigh fading case","channel state information","CSIR","cooperative vehicular communications","Monte Carlo simulations","multiple antennas","fixed transmission rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal relay location","coverage region","MIMO relay channel","desired transmission rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we investigate the optimal relay location in the sense of maximizing suitably defined coverage region for MIMO relay channel.

In the present paper, the interference alignment is achieved using a number of MIMO relays in a scenario with K single antenna node pairs. A two-phase transmission scheme is considered assuming the channel to be constant during the transmission phases. Firstly, the source nodes transmit to both the relays and the destination nodes. Secondly, the source nodes and the relays retransmit to the destination nodes. By adapting the relays' processing matrices to the channel while fixing the nodes' filters, a linear system of equations is formulated which is solved for the interference alignment. The interference signals can be aligned perfectly at the destination nodes if there are enough relays. A closed-form solution with minimum retransmit energy at the relays is selected if the linear system of equations is under-determined. If the system of linear equations has no solution, i.e., if there are not enough relays, least squares based solutions are employed which minimize the total received interference. The results show that K/2 degrees of freedom are achieved if the interference signals are aligned perfectly. Furthermore, aligning the interference signals imperfectly achieves a capacity-gain over perfect interference alignment at low and moderate SNRs while requiring a lower number of relays.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328453.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect versus imperfect interference alignment using multiple MIMO relays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Equations","Antennas","MIMO","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","filtering theory","interference suppression","least squares approximations","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imperfect interference alignment","perfect interference alignment","multiple MIMO relays","mobile radio networks","high SNR","K-single antenna node pairs","two-phase transmission scheme","source nodes","destination nodes","relay processing matrices","node filters","interference signals","closed-form solution","minimum retransmit energy","linear equation system","least squares based solutions","total received interference minimization","K/2 degrees of freedom","capacity-gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interference alignment","relaying","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Perfect versus imperfect interference alignment using multiple MIMO relays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328453/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115024","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect versus imperfect interference alignment using multiple MIMO relays","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0676AlShatri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056746S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328454,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Alisson P.

We propose a linear precoder design which aims at alleviating the interference caused by Secondary User (SU) from the source for Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding (OSTBC) based CR. We resort to Minimum Variance (MV) approach to contrive the precoding matrix at Secondary Transmitter (ST) in order to maximize the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at Secondary Receiver (SR) on the premise that the orthogonality of OSTBC is kept, the interference introduced to Primary Link (PL) by Secondary Link (SL) is maintained under a tolerable level and the total transmitted power constraint at ST is satisfied. Moreover, the selection of polarization mode for SL is incorporated in the precoder design. In order to provide an analytic solution with low computational cost, we put forward an original precoder design algorithm which exploits an auxiliary variable to treat the optimization problem with a mixture of linear and quadratic constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed precoder design enable SR to have an agreeable SNR on the prerequisite that the interference at PR is maintained below the threshold.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328456","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328456.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328456","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","startPage":"691","endPage":"695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder design for Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding based Cognitive Radio with polarized antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Precoder design for Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding based Cognitive Radio with polarized antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328456/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328456/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115027","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder design for Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding based Cognitive Radio with polarized antennas","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0691Marzouki.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061037S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328461,"authors":[{"name":"Riichi Kudo","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Yokosuka, Japan","Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Riichi","lastName":"Kudo","id":"37319844500"},{"name":"Simon M.

Wireless systems with massive numbers of transmit antennas (Massive MIMO) are attractive to increase the channel capacity and/or energy efficiency. However, the downlink channel state information (CSI) estimation sequence suffers increased loss in terms of lower MAC efficiency and calculation complexity. This paper proposes a CSI feedback scheme based random beamforming weights for massive MIMO when the number of users is small. In the proposed scheme, the CSI estimation beams are randomly determined and the number of beams for CSI estimation is limited. By iteratively revising the random beamforming weight, the access point can obtain the CSI of the signal space of all transmit antennas. Simulation results show that the achievable bit rate of the proposed method approaches that of the full antenna CSI.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328461","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328461.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328461","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","startPage":"716","endPage":"720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSI estimation method based on random beamforming for massive number of transmit antenna systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"CSI estimation method based on random beamforming for massive number of transmit antenna systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328461/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328461/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115032","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSI estimation method based on random beamforming for massive number of transmit antenna systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0716Kudo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077574S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328463,"authors":[{"name":"Yuyu Yan","affiliation":["Industry Environment, Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuyu","lastName":"Yan","id":"38494343500"},{"name":"Huiyu Yuan","affiliation":["Industry Environment, Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huiyu","lastName":"Yuan","id":"38493741800"},{"name":"Naizheng Zheng","affiliation":["Radio Systems, Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Naizheng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38493426200"},{"name":"Skov Peter","affiliation":["Industry Environment, Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Skov","lastName":"Peter","id":"38493857800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328463","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Measurement","Resource management","Interference","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile radio","receiving antennas","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink multiuser MIMO","LTE Release-8","LTE-advanced networks","LTE spectrum efficiency","uplink reference signal enhancement","bandwidth allocation flexibility","MU-MIMO scheduling flow","MU-MIMO pairing metrics","LTE system-level simulator","receive antenna configuration","resource allocation strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-Advanced","Uplink","Multi-User MIMO","Realistic Channel Estimation"]}],"abstract":"In LTE Release-8, Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) in the uplink direction is supported with improvement of LTE spectrum efficiency.

However, the prominently theoretical works on this topic are based on several crucial assumptions about the wireless channel which have not been sufficiently validated by measurements. In this paper, we report on an outdoor measurement campaign with a scalable virtual antenna array consisting of up to 112 elements. The large amount of acquired data allows us to study several important aspects of large-scale MIMO systems. For example, we partially confirm the theoretical results based on uncorrelated channels which predict that the channels at different positions become more and more orthogonal as the number of antennas grows. However, for the measured channels, the marginal gain of an additional antenna quickly diminishes. Nevertheless, our results indicate that most of the theoretical benefits of large-scale MIMO could be realized also over the measured channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328480","startPage":"811","endPage":"815","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328480.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel measurements for large antenna arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328480/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Channel measurements for large antenna arrays","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13115051","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328480/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel measurements for large antenna arrays","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0811Hoydis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057403S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6328481,"authors":[{"name":"Miltiades Filippou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Miltiades","lastName":"Filippou","id":"38493177800"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"},{"name":"Haifan Yin","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Haifan","lastName":"Yin","id":"38493026100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328481","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","cognitive radio","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decontaminating pilots","cognitive massive MIMO networks","spectrum utilization","channel estimation problem","interference-prone cognitive radio setup","secondary base station","primary base station","multiple antenna capability","multiple users","secondary-caused interference","secondary transmitter","primary system","robust channel estimator","multipath model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","massive MIMO","channel estimation","scheduling","covariance information"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio has been lately suggested as a promising technology in order to improve spectrum utilization. This paper addresses the problem of channel estimation in an underlay interference-prone cognitive radio setup. We consider a primary and a secondary base station, both with multiple antenna capability and serving multiple users. Although previous studies propose the use of beamforming to handle secondary-caused interference, this cannot be done in practice unless channels are correctly estimated in the first place. However channel estimation itself is plagued by interference (pilot contamination effects). Therefore we propose a method to address channel estimation at the primary system while removing contamination caused by the secondary transmitter. The approach is twofold: (i) We develop a robust channel estimator which makes use of covariance information. We show analytically that the performance of this estimator is identical to the interference free scenario under certain when the number of antennas becomes large under a condition on the distribution of the multipath model. (ii) We build a pilot assignment algorithm which seeks to fulfill this condition. Significant gains are reported.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328481","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328481.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","startPage":"816","endPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decontaminating pilots in cognitive massive MIMO networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decontaminating pilots in cognitive massive MIMO networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328481/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115052","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328481/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decontaminating pilots in cognitive massive MIMO networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0816Filippou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132768S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":6328482,"authors":[{"name":"Adam L.

This work generalizes an iterative beamforming algorithm for multiuser MIMO signaling, subject to such a per-node power constraint, that can accommodate nonlinear precoding and detection.

In this work we develop a greedy dynamic joint clustering scheduling algorithm for the downlink of CoMP systems by assuming that the set of candidate clusters is limited and predetermined, based on UEs measurements. The set of non-overlapping selected clusters and the UEs scheduled in each cluster change dynamically at each time slot and are optimized by maximizing the system weighted sum rate. We evaluate the performance of the developed method by considering different criteria to select the set of available clusters and different policies to schedule the UEs in each cluster.

In order to successfully enable CoMP, accurate channel knowledge is required. In our work we focus on uplink joint reception, using linear MMSE combining, suppressing interference. We use LTE-Advanced signal formats together with realistic time-varying frequency-selective channel models. We investigate the performance of different channel estimators in conjunction with several types of Zadoff-Chu-based pilot sequence assignments and different operation points for interference-over thermal noise (IoT) and SIR. The channels are either estimated jointly or separately for all users within the coordinated cell set. We show for Zadoff-Chu sequences that the necessity for joint estimation is much higher for the case of separation by different roots than for the case of separation by different shifts. We also show dependencies of joint estimation gains over IoT and SIR and the interconnection with different approaches for the receive combiner.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328487","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328487.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation across multiple cells in coordinated multi-point","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328487/","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation across multiple cells in coordinated multi-point","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115058","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328487/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation across multiple cells in coordinated multi-point","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0845Wild.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049157S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328491,"authors":[{"name":"Leticia Aladr\u00e9n","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Leticia","lastName":"Aladr\u00e9n","id":"38276760300"},{"name":"Paloma Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Paloma","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37275351700"},{"name":"Pedro Luis Carro","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro Luis","lastName":"Carro","id":"37294050100"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas de Mingo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"de Mingo","id":"37284816600"},{"name":"Cesar Sanchez-Perez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Sanchez-Perez","id":"38274871800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328491","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"abstract":"Predistortion linearizer for high nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) is an important topic of research in wireless applications.

As a result, such a method guarantees non-requirement of the algorithm mentioned for OSLM design.

Indeed, the transmitted data symbols in FBMC are OQAM (Offset QAM) modulated, and the received data symbols are corrupted by inherent interference terms which complicate the detection in a maximum likelihood (ML) sense in the spatial multiplexing scheme. Detection schemes with ISI estimation and cancellation are not always effective due to the error propagation. We propose in this paper to modify the conventional FBMC system by transmitting QAM data symbols instead of OQAM ones in order to reduce the inherent interference. Then, we propose a receiver based on ISI estimation and cancellation. A simple tentative detector is first used to attempt to cancel the ISI before applying the ML detection. We show by simulation that with the proposed FBMC/QAM system, the ISI cancellation is effective and the performance converges to the optimum one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On ISI cancellation in MIMO-ML detection using FBMC/QAM modulation","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328508","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328508.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"On ISI cancellation in MIMO-ML detection using FBMC/QAM modulation","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328508/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115079","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On ISI cancellation in MIMO-ML detection using FBMC/QAM modulation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p0949Zakaria.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056241S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328509,"authors":[{"name":"Soheil Salari","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Electrical Engineering, K.

In this paper, we describe the proposed transmitter and receiver, including the chaotic modulation used in a single input, single output system, and then we evaluate the potential benefits of the MC-DCSK. To increase security, a spreading and interleaving in time and frequency are used to break the similarity between the reference and the data samples of the DCSK signal. The performance of the MC-DCSK is evaluated under a fading communication channel, and without equalization on the receiver side. An approach for computing the bit-error-rate (BER) performance is provided, and an analytical BER expression is derived.

A simple combining strategy is used at the receiver end before the iterative decoding, so that decoding can be performed on the same mother code. As a consequence, the decoding complexity is the same irrespectively of the number of fading blocks.

The problem is studied from two perspectives: system level and user level. At the system level, a secondary network manager (SNM) is interested in minimizing the secondary network outage probability subject to peak power constraints on SU transmission power levels and a constraint on the maximum interference generated at the primary receiver. The resulting system level optimization problem is converted to a convex one. At the user level, SUs selfishly increase their transmission power levels to maximize their outage-based utility functions, and SNM imposes a cost on each SU based on its interference power at the primary receiver. The system level optimization problem is converted to a convex one. The user level optimization problem is formulated as a strategic (non-cooperative) power control game, which admits a unique Nash equilibrium. A distributed algorithm for computing the Nash equilibrium is proposed. Finally, an optimal pricing scheme is presented which eliminates the gap between network and user level performances by aligning the optimal solution of system level problem with the Nash equilibrium of the user level problem.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328525","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328525.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328525","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","startPage":"1034","endPage":"1038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An outage-based game design for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An outage-based game design for cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328525/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115096","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An outage-based game design for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p1034Nekouei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058936S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328526,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Cheng","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38469649200"},{"name":"Sheng Li","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37537863100"},{"name":"Jianshu Zhang","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Jianshu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37717251700"},{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"},{"name":"Yuan Zhou","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37592208300"},{"name":"Mingjie Dong","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Mingjie","lastName":"Dong","id":"38491554600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328526","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"abstract":"In this work, a novel linear precoding algorithm, called linear precoding-based geometric mean decomposition (LP-GMD), is proposed for the downlink of multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

Then it uses the GMD to decompose the equivalent single-user MIMO channel into multiple parallel sub-channels that have the same effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which allows the use of the same modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for different spatial streams of each user. A system-level simulator is then set up based on the IEEE 802.11ac standard.

Simulation results generated using specifications envisaged for IEEE 802.11ac demonstrate the gains offered by the proposed technique with practical modulation and coding schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328528","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328528.pdf","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fair MU-MIMO scheme for IEEE 802.11ac","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328528/","displayDocTitle":"A fair MU-MIMO scheme for IEEE 802.11ac","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115099","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328528/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fair MU-MIMO scheme for IEEE 802.11ac","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p1049Esslaoui.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05891S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6328529,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Through this multi-user multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) technique the access point (AP) can simultaneously transmit multiple independent groups of streams to different stations. The consequent precoding requires precise channel knowledge and thus regular channel sounding and feedback. The interval to choose for this sounding procedure is an important factor. A compromise between precise channel knowledge at the AP and reduction of the associated overhead is needed. The first is a physical (PHY) layer parameter and the second is evaluated at the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper we present a PHY+MAC analysis of the impact of the channel sounding interval on MU-MIMO transmissions for different scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324001/6328315/06328529.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1058","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PHY+MAC channel sounding interval analysis for IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","Standards","Antennas","Downlink","Protocols","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","space division multiplexing","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO","PHY+MAC channel sounding interval analysis","IEEE 802.11ac standard","spatial division multiplexing access","downlink version","wireless local access world","multiuser multiple input multiple output technique","access point","multiple independent groups","consequent precoding","regular channel sounding","regular channel feedback","physical layer parameter","medium access control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel sounding","cross-layer simulator","crosstalk interference","IEEE 802.11ac","MU-MIMO","sounding interval"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"PHY+MAC channel sounding interval analysis for IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115100","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PHY+MAC channel sounding interval analysis for IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p1054Redieteab.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126757S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324001","isNumber":"6328315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324001","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6328315","articleId":"6328529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6328532,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Hosseinianfar","affiliation":["SUT, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Hosseinianfar","id":"38493863300"},{"name":"Saeed Mashhadi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Mashhadi","id":"37631181700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0762-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0761-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0760-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"6328532","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Bismuth","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","radio receivers","signal detection","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent UWB receiver structure","multilevel spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA systems","ultrawideband communication systems","low power consumption","interference suppression","multiuser efficiency","UWB channels","code division multiple access system","channel estimation","multilevel SE-ST CDMA system","noncoherent detection","signal to noise ratio","SNR","code length","error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-Coherent Detection","SE/ST CDMA","Multi-Level Codes","UWB"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems are in focus because of their attractive features such as high capacity, low power consumption and robustness against fading.

Coherent SE/ST code division multiple access (CDMA) systems are widely addressed in the literature requiring accurate channel estimation and high implementation complexity. In this paper we propose multi-level SE/ST CDMA system with non-coherent detection and simple receiver structure. Our results demonstrate the effect of signal to noise ratio (SNR), code length and total number of users on the performance. We find some optimum values for code length minimizing the probability of error.

In this paper, a novel mathematical model of the spatial sampling constraints for a BMR cylindrical multistatic scan geometry is proposed. This model was derived by analyzing the bounds of the spherical phase function of a generic multistatic scan geometry. The validity of the model was evaluated using numeric phantoms that mimic the dielectric properties of breast tissues.

The data is generated by the iterative physical optics method for a scale-model generic tank at X-band.

The FDTD method is implemented on the Accelerated Processing Unit's integrated GPU using the DirectCompute application programming interface and compared against an FDTD implementation on a GPU configured as a co-processor via a PCIe bus. The FDTD method is also implemented in parallel on the APU using the vector processing capability of the cores. The arrangement of both GPU and CPU cores on the same die has the potential to allow the concurrent processing of the FDTD method on both GPU and multi-core processor.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6314416/6328565/06328782.pdf","startPage":"1046","endPage":"1049","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICEAA.2012.6328782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEAA.2012.6328782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of the FDTD algorithm implemented on an integrated GPU versus a GPU configured as a co-processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Graphics processing unit","Time domain analysis","Acceleration","Multicore processing","Vectors","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","graphics processing units","peripheral interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD algorithm","integrated GPU","GPU coprocessor","slave devices","peripheral component interconnect express","PCIe bus","accelerated processing unit","APU","integrated circuit die","DirectCompute application programming interface","multicore processor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of the FDTD algorithm implemented on an integrated GPU versus a GPU configured as a co-processor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13061027","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of the FDTD algorithm implemented on an integrated GPU versus a GPU configured as a co-processor","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108832S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6314416","isNumber":"6328565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6314416","xplore-issue":"6328565","articleId":"6328782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328784,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For analysis, physicians use signal changes evident in ECG signals, such as, time intervals, shape of peaks, predefined peak compositions, etc., all of which require ECG signal information. The most important part of computerized ECG signal classification is to produce the discriminative features properly to identify heart disorders. Proposed locality based Fourier transform based method is a powerful solution for feature extraction which exploits local information embedded in the signal. Extraction of proper set of features is critical for successful execution of the local Fourier transform. In this paper, we present experimental results with different combination of Fourier coefficient obtained from MIT-BIH database. We compare our method with similar approach obtained by principal component analysis (PCA) features to prove classification accuracy.","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Applied Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Applied Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6322864/6328849/06328891.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting locality based Fourier transform for ECG signal diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328891/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting locality based Fourier transform for ECG signal diagnosis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13061161","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328891/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting locality based Fourier transform for ECG signal diagnosis","confLoc":"Pilsen, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"064002pid2414239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051726S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6322864","isNumber":"6328849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6322864","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328849","articleId":"6328891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Univ of West Bohemia","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6328898,"authors":[{"name":"Gheorghe \u015eerban","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Gheorghe","lastName":"\u015eerban","id":"38535010700"},{"name":"Constantin Anton","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Anton","id":"37409839000"},{"name":"Lauren\u0163iu Mihai Ionescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Lauren\u0163iu Mihai","lastName":"Ionescu","id":"37398291000"},{"name":"Ion Tut\u0103nescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Tut\u0103nescu","id":"38228668200"},{"name":"Alin Maz\u0103re","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Communications and Computers, University of Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Maz\u0103re","id":"38228668500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-80-261-0039-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1963-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1803-7232"}],"articleNumber":"6328898","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328898","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Hardware","Associative memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Polynomials","Error correction","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","content-addressable storage","error correction","error correction codes","error detection","error detection codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H-ARQ system","real time error detection","hardware associative memories","hardware error correction","detection circuit","stored binary value","encoder","corresponded word code","communication channel","associative memory recognition","hardware system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["associative memories","error detecting and correcting codes","Field Programmable Gates Array (FPGA)","Hybrid Automatic Request (H-ARQ)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a solution of design and implementation of a hardware error correction and detection circuit using associative memories.

Despite attempts to reduce the area of sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions, they cannot achieve the efficiency of threshold activation function. A new NSR efficient architecture for threshold networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed architecture uses different number of bits for weight storage in different layers. The optimum number of bits for each layer is found based on the mathematical derivation using stochastic model. Network training is done using the recently introduced learning algorithm called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). A 4-7-4 network is considered as a case study and its hardware implementation for different weight accuracies is investigated. The proposed design is more efficient considering area \u00d7 NSR as a performance metric. VLSI implementation of the proposed architecture using a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process is presented which shows 44.16%, 58.04 % and 67.30% improvement for total number of bits equal to 16, 20 and 24.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation of threshold neural networks","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328941","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324002/6328940/06328941.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation of threshold neural networks","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328941/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13061196","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hardware implementation of threshold neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0018182C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087843S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6328941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328942,"authors":[{"name":"Romain H\u00e9loir","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Institut Telecom, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"H\u00e9loir","id":"38489889900"},{"name":"Camille Leroux","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, Institut Polytechnique de Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Camille","lastName":"Leroux","id":"37545078800"},{"name":"Saied Hemati","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Saied","lastName":"Hemati","id":"37265078400"},{"name":"Matthieu Arzel","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Institut Telecom, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Arzel","id":"37276347900"},{"name":"Warren J.

This paper addresses the problem of long access times in such multilevel gain-cell DRAMs, which are further aggravated by process parameter variations. A replica bit-line (BL) technique, previously proposed for SRAM, is adapted to speed up the multilevel read operation at a negligible area-increase. Moreover, the same replica column is used to improve the write access time. An 8-kb DRAM macro implemented in 90-nm CMOS technology shows that the replica column is able to successfully track die-to-die process, voltage, and temperature variations to generate control signals with optimum delay. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations show that a small timing margin of 100 ps is sufficient to also cope with within-die process variations.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328960","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324002/6328940/06328960.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Replica bit-line technique for embedded multilevel gain-cell DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328960/","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Replica bit-line technique for embedded multilevel gain-cell DRAM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13061215","publicationDate":"June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6328960/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replica bit-line technique for embedded multilevel gain-cell DRAM","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0208030C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0525S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6328960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6328968,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Sandrin Ntoun\u00e9 Ntoun\u00e9","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Roger Sandrin","lastName":"Ntoun\u00e9 Ntoun\u00e9","id":"38490103600"},{"name":"Mohammed Bahoura","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Bahoura","id":"37267277600"},{"name":"Chan-Wang Park","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Rimouski, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Chan-Wang","lastName":"Park","id":"37277791100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0859-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0857-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0858-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6328968","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Neurons","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Biological neural networks","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","delays","field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pipeline processing","power amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","pipelined neural network","power amplifier modelling","pipelined real-valued time-delay neural network","pseudo- conventional RVTDNN architectures","inherent concurrent computing tasks","field programmable gate array","pipelined architecture","backpropagation learning algorithm","adaptive correction","neuron weights","RVTDNN models","16-QAM baseband signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Modeling","Pipelined","Power Amplifier (PA)","Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"FPGA-Implementation of pipelined real-valued time-delay neural network (RVTDNN) for power amplifier modeling is presented in this paper.

Results obtained with both RVTDNN models using a modulated 16-QAM baseband signal are very close to those obtained comparing with the reference model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-implementation of pipelined neural network for power amplifier modeling","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328968","startPage":"109","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328940","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324002/6328940/06328968.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-implementation of pipelined neural network for power amplifier modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328968/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13061223","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-implementation of pipelined neural network for power amplifier modeling","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0288203C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077189S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6328968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6328975,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan H.

Low cost and energy efficient sensors require methods that compute their position using indirect information such as RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). This work presents an artificial neural networks (ANNs) approach to localization in wireless sensor networks through the adjustment of the ANNs structures using Genetic Algorithms. A population of feedforward ANNs containing their structure in a genetic code is evolved during 20 generations. Each individual is evaluated through the training of the artificial neural network and further calculation of its root mean square error for all the testing set. The RSSI measurements were used as the artificial neural networks inputs to localize the nodes. The approach was tested using the MATLAB-based Probabilistic Wireless Network Simulator (Prowler) to collect the artificial neural networks input data, under simulated static indoor network environment of 26\u00d726 meters with 8 anchor nodes, i.e., nodes with awareness of their positions. The MATLAB's genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks toolboxes were used. Results using the best artificial neural network structure found after optimization had a root mean square error of 0.41 meters, a maximum error of 1.07 meters and a minimum error of 0.014 meters.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328975","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6328975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328940","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324002/6328940/06328975.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to localization scheme of wireless sensor networks based on artificial neural networks and Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328975/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An approach to localization scheme of wireless sensor networks based on artificial neural networks and Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328975/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13061230","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to localization scheme of wireless sensor networks based on artificial neural networks and Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0358316C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056209S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6328975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6328984,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-Xin Liu","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xue-Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406536100"},{"name":"Sheldon X.-D.

The new method, called ETBR-GPU, first performs sampling-like reduction on the original circuit matrices where the frequency domain responses at different frequency points can be calculated in parallel on multicore CPU. After the reduction, the reduced circuit matrices, which are dense but well suitable for GPU's data parallel computing, are simulated on GPU. Such reduction based simulation technique is very amenable for parallelization on the hybrid multicore and GPU platforms, where coarse-grained task-level and fine-grained lightweight-thread level parallelism can be both exploited. The proposed method is very general, since it can analyze any linear networks with complicated structures and macromodels, and it does not assume some structure properties in order to build problem-specific preconditioners, as many iterative solvers do. Experiments show that the new method achieves about one or two orders of magnitude speedup when compared to the general LU-based simulation method on some recently published IBM power grid benchmark circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6328984/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6328984/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13061239","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Transient analysis of large linear dynamic networks on hybrid GPU-multicore platforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient analysis of large linear dynamic networks on hybrid GPU-multicore platforms","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0448225C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044576S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6328984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6328997,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Ferent","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Ferent","id":"37391479600"},{"name":"Alex Doboli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Doboli","id":"37272661500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0859-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0857-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0858-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6328997","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6328997","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Topology","Integrated circuit modeling","Bandwidth","Analog circuits","Couplings","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-voltage amplifiers","automated topological matching","signal path structures","symbolic expressions","analog circuit synthesis tools","fitting topology"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the comparison of two low-voltage amplifiers using a systematic, two step procedure: (i) automated topological matching highlighting common and different signal path structures and symbolic expressions and (ii) constraint extraction and analysis illustrating how dissimilarities between circuits impact relevant performance and showing design flexibility with respect to trade-offs.

The nanopillars were achieved with a continuous deep reactive ion etching technique and utilizing PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) and Chromium as masking layers. As opposed to the conventional Bosch process, the usage of the unswitched deep reactive ion etching technique resulted in nanopillars with smooth sidewalls with a measured surface roughness of less than 40nm. Moreover, undercut was nonexistent in the nanopillars. The proposed fabrication method achieves etch rates four times faster when compared to the state-of-the-art, leading to higher throughput and more vertical side walls. The fabrication of the nanopillars was carried out keeping the CMOS process in mind to ultimately obtain a CMOS-compatible process.

The systems are designed to be integrated with the CMOS based camera unit. Starting from our initial JPEG based watermarking design, through an MJPEG one, we will also report on the watermarking solution for the commonly used MPEG encoded video. The current reported system works in real time right after the capturing of video by the CMOS based image sensor. The watermark embedding is processed in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain which allows the integration of both watermarking and encoding of the video (or image) into a single system. The hardware based watermarking system described here, works efficiently without high penalty in system power consumption and hardware resources. Moreover, the watermarking rate (watermark generation and embedding) is also high enough to adapt with the frame rate of MPEG-4 video streams in realtime. This new hardware based watermarking system for CMOS based image sensor features minimum video quality degradation and it can withstand certain potential attacks i.e. cover-up attack, cropping, and segment removal from video sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of hardware based watermarking solutions for CMOS image sensors","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6329026","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324002/6328940/06329026.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6329026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of hardware based watermarking solutions for CMOS image sensors","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329026/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13061281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of hardware based watermarking solutions for CMOS image sensors","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0868307C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057182S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6329026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6329040,"authors":[{"name":"Sergej Werner","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sergej","lastName":"Werner","id":"38235730200"},{"name":"Danish Kalim","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Danish","lastName":"Kalim","id":"37399321800"},{"name":"Renato Negra","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Negra","id":"37275858200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0859-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0857-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0858-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6329040","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"abstract":"High efficiency with high power amplification is of great concern in modern wireless communication systems to increase battery life and reliability.

Moreover, being non-volatile, the proposed architecture exhibits a zero leakage compared to a Data-Retention Flip-Flop, which consumes ~3.2\u03bcW in sleep mode (leakage) for a 10K Flip-Flop design implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology.

Leveraging energy storage components whose voltage level varies with the state of charge, it becomes efficient to perform voltage monitoring. In this paper, we propose two types of analog-to-digital voltage monitoring interfaces. In both cases, their outputs directly fit asynchronous 4-phases protocol and Quasi Delay Insensitive (QDI) logic. On the one hand, in a passive voltage monitoring scheme, the platform waits for energy-events. Reacting to voltage threshold crossings, data-events are generated and sent to the asynchronous controller. On the other hand, in an active scheme, the platform waits for an asynchronous data-event before evaluating the voltage level. The analog structure is thus included into the asynchronous protocol and provides a controlled voltage monitoring. These innovative structures allow the voltage monitoring power consumption to be under 300 nA at 0.8 V and to be functional in a wide supply voltage range up to 1.8V.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6329055","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324002/6328940/06329055.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6329055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329055/","displayDocTitle":"Event-driven asynchronous voltage monitoring in energy harvesting platforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13061309","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329055/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-driven asynchronous voltage monitoring in energy harvesting platforms","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1158249C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048985S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6329055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6329058,"authors":[{"name":"Mazen Abi Hussein","affiliation":["LaMIPS, Laboratoire commun NXP-CRISMAT, UMR 6508 CNRS ENSICAEN ESIEE, UCBN Caen, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Mazen","lastName":"Abi Hussein","id":"38273976500"},{"name":"Vivek Ashok Bohara","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Cit\u00e9 Descartes, Noisy-Le-Grand, France"],"firstName":"Vivek Ashok","lastName":"Bohara","id":"37589863200"},{"name":"Olivier Venard","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Cit\u00e9 Descartes, Noisy-Le-Grand, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Venard","id":"37543246100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0859-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0857-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0858-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6329058","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Computational modeling","Predistortion","Delay","Indexes","Two dimensional displays","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomials","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional memory selective polynomial model","digital predistortion model","2D MSP model","DPD","generalized memory polynomial","GMP","class AB power amplifier","adjacent channel power ratio","ACPR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion","memory polynomial","generalized memory polynomial"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a Two-Dimensional Memory Selective Polynomial (2-D MSP) model for digital predistortion (DPD).

In this paper we propose an initial implementation for a hybrid wireless network-on-chip (WiNoC) interconnect architecture, named iWISE, for current chip multiprocessors (CMPs). iWISE combines wired interconnects with wireless links that use both frequency and time division multiplexing to offer a balanced, flexible, orthogonal wireless data transfer among cores. We provide a basic description of the iWISE architecture and describe a practical solution for the implementation of wireless interconnects based on an on-off keying (OOK) modulator using ultra-compact Double Gate (DG) CMOS devices. The proposed OOK modulator takes advantage of DG-CMOS devices especially in building compact modulation and tunable amplification circuitry. Real applications from the benchmark suite PARSEC as well as synthetic traffic show an improvement in performance as well as a savings in power.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6329063","publicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6324002/6328940/06329063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6329063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328940","startPage":"489","endPage":"492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient modulation for a wireless network-on-chip architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient modulation for a wireless network-on-chip architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329063/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13061317","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6329063/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient modulation for a wireless network-on-chip architecture","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1238163C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062921S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6324002","isNumber":"6328940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6324002","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6328940","articleId":"6329063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6329064,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijit Sil","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Sil","id":"37702554300"},{"name":"Srikanth Bakkamanthala","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"Bakkamanthala","id":"38489925200"},{"name":"Swetha karlapudi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Swetha","lastName":"karlapudi","id":"37589482700"},{"name":"Magdy Bayoumi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Bayoumi","id":"37273386500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0859-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0857-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0858-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6329064","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":668},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Noise","Arrays","Microprocessors","Circuit stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","circuit stability","low-power electronics","memory architecture","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-port subthreshold 7T SRAM cell","ultra-low power application","supply voltage","SRAM cell design","stability issue","stable 2-port 7T SRAM cell","dynamic read noise margin","bit-interleaved SRAM architecture","write operation","read operation","two level write decoder architecture","pseudoread problem","size 100 nm","size 90 nm","voltage 0.22 V","frequency 2 MHz"]}],"abstract":"As the supply voltage is reducing with feature size, SRAM cell design is going through severe stability issues.

Dealing with these lengths is a challenge, especially for large graphs. Stress models are often employed in this situation. However, the traditional full stress model is not scalable due to its reliance on an initial all-pairs shortest path calculation. A number of fast approximation algorithms have been proposed. While they work well for some graphs, the results are less satisfactory on graphs of intrinsically high dimension, because some nodes may be placed too close together, or even share the same position. We propose a solution, called the maxent-stress model, which applies the principle of maximum entropy to cope with the extra degrees of freedom. We describe a force-augmented stress majorization algorithm that solves the maxent-stress model. Numerical results show that the algorithm scales well, and provides acceptable layouts for large, nonrigid graphs. This also has potential applications to scalable algorithms for statistical multidimensional scaling (MDS) with variable distances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Maxent-Stress Model for Graph Layout","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2012.299","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6494559/06329372.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6494559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329372/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Maxent-Stress Model for Graph Layout","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6329372/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13414478","pubMedId":"23559507","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Maxent-Stress Model for Graph Layout","sourcePdf":"ttg2013060927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142563S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6494559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6494559","articleId":"6329372","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6329382,"authors":[{"name":"Erwin H.

The bandwidth density and bit-rate transparency offered by optical systems are uniquely suited to address these challenges facing memory interconnects. We, thus, investigate a hybrid packet- and circuit-switched optical interconnection network linking microprocessors with their associated main memory, which can simultaneously reduce memory access latency and improve energy efficiency performance. This novel hybrid approach allows low-bandwidth memory control data and small memory transactions to be efficiently transmitted as wavelength-striped optical packets, while long bursts of memory accesses are optically circuit switched. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate an optically connected memory system in which a microprocessor accesses multiple 80-Gb/s memory modules all-optically across a hybrid packet- and circuit- switched optical network. Error-free communication between the microprocessor and main memory is confirmed (bit-error rates less than 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n) with the optical network providing low-memory access latencies.

To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of the common existing road centerline algorithms, this letter presents a new method to extract the road centerline from high-resolution imagery based on shape features and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), in which potential road segments were obtained based on shape features and spectral feature, followed by MARS to extract road centerlines.

surveillance radar system. In the algorithm, after proper preprocessing and matrix combination, the combined matrix of radar echoes can be regarded as the superposition of three matrices, namely, a low-rank matrix of ground clutter, a sparse matrix of moving targets, and an entry-wise matrix of noise component. Then, the recently proposed relaxed version of principal component pursuit is used to realize ground clutter (low-rank matrix) and moving target (sparse matrix) separation under the influence of entry-wise noise. Both simulation and real data processing results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the results show the advantage of the proposed method in a nonhomogeneous environment when compared with a reduced-dimension space-time adaptive processing method.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2012.2216248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6361358/06329408.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2216248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361358","startPage":"617","endPage":"621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ground Moving Target Extraction in a Multichannel Wide-Area Surveillance SAR/GMTI System via the Relaxed PCP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ground Moving Target Extraction in a Multichannel Wide-Area Surveillance SAR/GMTI System via the Relaxed PCP","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329408/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146590","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6329408/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground Moving Target Extraction in a Multichannel Wide-Area Surveillance SAR/GMTI System via the Relaxed PCP","sourcePdf":"lgrs-yan-2216248-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075953S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6361358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6361358","articleId":"6329408","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":6329410,"authors":[{"name":"Qike Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Qike","lastName":"Wang","id":"38245709700"},{"name":"Kam-Hon Tse","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kam-Hon","lastName":"Tse","id":"37590038500"},{"name":"Lian-Kuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lian-Kuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280379700"},{"name":"Soung-Chang Liew","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Soung-Chang","lastName":"Liew","id":"37279300600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6329410","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329410","abstract":"We experimentally demonstrate a novel optical physical-layer network coding scheme over a time-division multiplexing passive optical network.

The question we ask in this paper is the following: is it possible to achieve a form of agreement also in presence of antagonistic interactions, modeled as negative weights on the communication graph? The answer to this question is affirmative: on signed networks all agents can converge to a consensus value which is the same for all agents except for the sign. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained to describe cases in which this is possible. These conditions have strong analogies with the theory of monotone systems.

The classical \u201chill climbing\u201d and \u201cincremental conductance\u201d MPPT algorithms are widely applied in many papers and applications. Both algorithms perturb the operating conditions of the PV array and detect the changes in generated power. Since the detected change in generated power also could be a result of changes in irradiance, both algorithms are prone to failure in case of large changes in irradiance. This paper starts to discuss the size of the perturbation of the operating conditions for both algorithms, based on the single-diode model. The result is used to select the updating frequency for the two algorithms, in order not to run away under certain dynamic conditions. Both algorithms are implemented in an inverter and tested over 16 days of simultaneous operation. Basic statistical procedures, the paired t-test, have been applied to the data with the conclusion that the two algorithms perform equally good.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the \u201cHill Climbing\u201d and the \u201cIncremental Conductance\u201d Maximum Power Point Trackers for Photovoltaic Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2012.2218816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/6340605/06329418.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2012.2218816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340605","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the \u201cHill Climbing\u201d and the \u201cIncremental Conductance\u201d Maximum Power Point Trackers for Photovoltaic Power Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6329418/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136484","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the \u201cHill Climbing\u201d and the \u201cIncremental Conductance\u201d Maximum Power Point Trackers for Photovoltaic Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tec-kjr-2218816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064272S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6340605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"6340605","articleId":"6329418","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6329421,"authors":[{"name":"Huihui Song","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6484138/6329421/6329421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huihui Song received the B.S. degree in technology and science of electronic information from the Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, in 2008 and the M.S. degree in communication and information system from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2011.

For this purpose, this method establishes correspondence between low-spatial-resolution but high-temporal-resolution (LSHT) data and high-spatial-resolution but low-temporal-resolution (HSLT) data through the superresolution of LSHT data and further fusion by using high-pass modulation. Specifically, this method is implemented in two stages. In the first stage, the spatial resolution of LSHT data on prior and prediction dates is improved simultaneously by means of sparse representation; in the second stage, the known HSLT and the superresolved LSHTs are fused via high-pass modulation to generate the HSHT data on the prediction date. Remarkably, this method forms a unified framework for blending remote sensing images with temporal reflectance changes, whether phenology change (e.g., seasonal change of vegetation) or land-cover-type change (e.g., conversion of farmland to built-up area) based on a two-layer spatiotemporal fusion strategy due to the large spatial resolution difference between HSLT and LSHT data. This method was tested on both a simulated data set and two actual data sets of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer acquisitions. It was also compared with other well-known spatiotemporal fusion algorithms on two types of data: images primarily with phenology changes and images primarily with land-cover-type changes. Experimental results demonstrated that our method performed better in capturing surface reflectance changes on both types of images.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2213095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6484138/06329421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2213095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6484138","startPage":"1883","endPage":"1896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion Through One-Pair Image Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion Through One-Pair Image Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13396650","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6329421/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion Through One-Pair Image Learning","sourcePdf":"tgrs-huang-2213095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123851S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6484138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6484138","articleId":"6329421","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6329429,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Cun Li","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6525345/6329429/6329429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan-Cun Li was born in Taitung, Taiwan, in 1982.

Fast FD is a mandatory step in order to make a suitable response to a fault in one of the semiconductor devices. The aim of this study is to present a fast yet robust method for fault diagnosis in nonisolated dc-dc converters. FD is based on time and current criteria which observe the slope of the inductor current over the time. It is realized by using a hybrid structure via coordinated operation of two FD subsystems that work in parallel. No additional sensors, which increase system cost and reduce reliability, are required for this detection method. For validation, computer simulations are first carried out. The proposed detection scheme is validated on a boost converter. Effects of input disturbances and the closed-loop control are also considered. In the experimental setup, a field programmable gate array digital target is used for the implementation of the proposed method, to perform a very fast switch FD. Results show that, with the presented method, FD is robust and can be done in a few microseconds.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2224078","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6512583/06329431.pdf","startPage":"4136","endPage":"4146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2224078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open- and Short-Circuit Switch Fault Diagnosis for Nonisolated DC\u2013DC Converters Using Field Programmable Gate Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Open- and Short-Circuit Switch Fault Diagnosis for Nonisolated DC\u2013DC Converters Using Field Programmable Gate Array","volume":"60","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13484416","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6329431/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open- and Short-Circuit Switch Fault Diagnosis for Nonisolated DC\u2013DC Converters Using Field Programmable Gate Array","sourcePdf":"tie-poure-2224078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06697S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6512583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6512583","articleId":"6329431","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":6329435,"authors":[{"name":"Zanxiang Nie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6409420/6329435/6329435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zanxiang Nie was born in Huizhou, China.

This high-dimensional nonlinear registration procedure results in a substantial increase in statistical power over more standard methods of intersubject averaging, and allows the automatic labeling of many anatomical features of the cortex.

These artifacts negatively affect the accuracy of registration by producing local optima, altering the gradient, shifting the global optimum, and making rigid registration asymmetric. In this paper, after an extensive literature review, we demonstrate the causes of the artifacts by comparing inclusion and avoidance of resampling analytically. We show the sum-of-squared-differences cost function formulated as an integral to be more accurate compared with its traditional sum form in a simple case of image registration. We then discuss aliasing that occurs in rotation, which is due to the fact that an image represented in the Cartesian grid is sampled with different rates in different directions, and propose the use of oscillatory isotropic interpolation kernels, which allow better recovery of true global optima by overcoming this type of aliasing. Through our experiments on brain, fingerprint, and white noise images, we illustrate the superior performance of the integral registration cost function in both the Cartesian and spherical coordinates, and also validate the introduced radial interpolation kernel by demonstrating the improvement in registration.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Image registration","Cost function","Kernel","Frequency domain analysis","Biomedical imaging","Low pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","image registration","image sampling","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artifact resampling","rigid image registration","continuous integral summation approximations","local optima","sum-of-squared-differences cost function","Cartesian grid","oscillatory isotropic interpolation kernels","white noise images","integral registration cost function","spherical coordinates","Cartesian coordinates","radial interpolation kernel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aliasing","image registration","image resampling","interpolation artifacts"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Brain","Dermatoglyphics","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2224356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6407512/06329438.pdf","startPage":"816","endPage":"827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6407512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2224356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Removing Interpolation and Resampling Artifacts in Rigid Image Registration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Removing Interpolation and Resampling Artifacts in Rigid Image Registration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329438/","volume":"22","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329438/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13219185","pubMedId":"23076044","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Removing Interpolation and Resampling Artifacts in Rigid Image Registration","sourcePdf":"tip-aganj-2224356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107498S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6407512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6407512","articleId":"6329438","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6329441,"authors":[{"name":"Jiann-Jong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6463474/6329441/6329441-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiann-Jong Chen (M\u201997) was born in Keelong, Taiwan, in 1966.

Traps exist even in the absence of shading, and degrade the performance of perturb and observe (PO) maximum power point trackers. A generalized PO (GPO) algorithm is proposed which eliminates this degradation. PO/GPO algorithms in the presence of random noise are shown to be modeled by multidimensional Markov chains. These models quantify the tendency for PO at low random noise levels to become stuck in traps following insolation changes, thereby decreasing tracking performance and reducing harvested power. By contrast, GPO tracks insolation changes unhindered by traps. All theoretical results are experimentally verified using a hardware PV converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329443/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13167901","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6329443/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis of a Generalized Perturb and Observe Algorithm Featuring Robust Operation in the Presence of Power Curve Traps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Analysis of a Generalized Perturb and Observe Algorithm Featuring Robust Operation in the Presence of Power Curve Traps","sourcePdf":"tpel-jones-2224378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113269S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6376188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6376188","articleId":"6329443","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6329445,"authors":[{"name":"Yongsoon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6329445/6329445-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongsoon Park (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include sensorless drives of electrical machines, and power conversion circuits."]},"firstName":"Yongsoon","lastName":"Park","id":"38184603000"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6329445/6329445-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Ki Sul (S\u201978\u2013M\u201980\u2013SM\u201998\u2013F\u201900) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1980, 1983, and 1986, respectively.","From 1986 to 1988, he was an Associate Researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison.

Fundamentally, the conversion efficiency from dc to ac power of an inverter is important. However, in the presence of partial shading, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) on PV modules is more important than the conversion efficiency. In this paper, a new control method for a three-level inverter is proposed. With the proposed method, each dc-link voltage of the three-level inverter can be asymmetrically regulated. When PV modules are split into two and each split module is connected to the respective dc-link capacitors of the inverter, the asymmetric control can be helpful because separate MPPTs are possible. The effectiveness of the proposed method was examined through experiments with a T-type three-level inverter, where each dc-link capacitor was supplied by a PV simulator emulating two separate PV modules under different shading conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6329445/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13167902","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Control of DC-Link Voltages for Separate MPPTs in Three-Level Inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Control of DC-Link Voltages for Separate MPPTs in Three-Level Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-park-2224139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071733S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6376188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6376188","articleId":"6329445","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6329453,"authors":[{"name":"Dorina Thanou","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Signal Processing Laboratory-LTS4, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6373759/6329453/6329453-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dorina Thanou (S\u201910) received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Patras, Greece, in 2008 and the M.Sc. degree in communication systems from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2010.","Since September 2010, she has been working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS4), EPFL, under the supervision of Prof. P.

We propose a novel quantization scheme that exploits the increasing correlation between the values exchanged by the sensors throughout the iterations of the consensus algorithm. A low complexity, uniform quantizer is implemented in each sensor, and refined quantization is achieved by progressively reducing the quantization intervals during the convergence of the consensus algorithm. We propose a recurrence relation for computing the quantization parameters that depend on the network topology and the communication rate. We further show that the recurrence relation can lead to a simple exponential model for the quantization step size over the iterations, whose parameters can be computed a priori. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the progressive quantization scheme that leads to the consensus solution even at low communication rate.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2223692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6373759/06329453.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2223692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373759","startPage":"194","endPage":"205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Average Consensus With Quantization Refinement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Average Consensus With Quantization Refinement","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6329453/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Average Consensus With Quantization Refinement","sourcePdf":"tsp-thanou-2223692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083787S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6373759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6373759","articleId":"6329453","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6329454,"authors":[{"name":"Jiann-Jong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6574241/6329454/6329454-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiann-Jong Chen was born in Keelong, Taiwan, in 1966.

We show that conventional de facto standard 6T and 8T static random access memory (SRAM) bit cells can embed ROM data without area overhead or performance degradation on the bit cells. Just by adding an extra wordline (WL) and connecting the WL to selected access transistor of the bit cell (based on whether a 0 or 1 is to be stored as ROM data in that location), the bit cell can work both in the SRAM mode and in the ROM mode. In the proposed ROM-embedded SRAM, during SRAM operations, ROM data is not available. To retrieve the ROM data, special write steps associated with proper via connections load ROM data into the SRAM array. The ROM data is read by conventional load instruction with unique virtual address space assigned to the data. This allows the ROM-embedded cache (R-cache) to bypass tag arrays and translation look-aside buffers, leading to fast ROM operations. We show example applications to illustrate how the R-cache can lead to low-cost logic testing and faster evaluation of mathematical functions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6574241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6574241/06329456.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2217514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2217514","startPage":"1583","endPage":"1595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area Efficient ROM-Embedded SRAM Cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329456/","displayDocTitle":"Area Efficient ROM-Embedded SRAM Cache","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329456/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"13684766","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area Efficient ROM-Embedded SRAM Cache","sourcePdf":"TVLSI-LEE-2217514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080516S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6574241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6574241","articleId":"6329456","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6329461,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

As technology scales further in sub 40 nm, process variations present another major design challenge, which makes the transient faults analysis more complicated. To address process variations, this paper presents a statistical soft error rate (SER) analysis method based on modified response surface modeling and artificial neural network modeling. Experimental examples show that the proposed method provides fast and accurate SER estimation. The results have shown that the process variation has significant impact on the SER and use of only a static SER analysis will generally underestimate the circuit SER.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Training","Analytical models","Logic design","Artificial neural networks","Circuit faults","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","neural nets","radiation effects","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","digital logic design","process variations","digital systems","single event transients","CMOS technology scaling","transient faults analysis","statistical soft error rate","artificial neural network modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","process design kit","process variations","response surface modeling","single event effects","soft error rate","statistical analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329469","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2012.2219070","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6365378/06329469.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2012.2219070","startPage":"2811","endPage":"2817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Analysis of Soft Error Rate in Digital Logic Design Including Process Variations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Analysis of Soft Error Rate in Digital Logic Design Including Process Variations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329469/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","volume":"59","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6329469/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13169726","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Analysis of Soft Error Rate in Digital Logic Design Including Process Variations","sourcePdf":"tns-yao-2219070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088595S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6365378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6365378","articleId":"6329469","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6329473,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Noori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Noori","id":"37703264400"},{"name":"Masoud Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Ardakani","id":"37272335000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6329473","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329473","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Upper bound","Signal to noise ratio","Encoding","Downlink","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","data communication","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","electronic data interchange","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal user pairing","asymmetric multiway relay channel","pairwise relaying","data exchange","data transmission","pairwise transmission","functional decode forward","decode-and- forward","FDF","DF","channel condition","pairing strategy maximization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-way relay channels","functional-decode-forward","decode-and-forward","pairing strategy","common rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.100812.121258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6361502/06329473.pdf","startPage":"1852","endPage":"1855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.100812.121258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal User Pairing for Asymmetric Multi-Way Relay Channels with Pairwise Relaying","abstract":"We study an asymmetric multi-way relay channel where users have different channel conditions. To enable data exchange between the users, an existing practical approach, where users transmit their data to the relay in pairs, is considered. For pairwise transmission, we consider two different scenarios at the relay, called functional-decode-forward (FDF) and decode-and-forward (DF). For both FDF and DF, we first show that due to unequal channel conditions, the achievable common rate of the pairwise strategy depends on the order in which the users are paired. This motivates us to find the pairing strategy maximizing the achievable rate. This rate is then compared with the capacity upper bound and the achievable rate of a random user pairing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329473/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2012","volume":"16","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"13146837","publicationDate":"November 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329473/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal User Pairing for Asymmetric Multi-Way Relay Channels with Pairwise Relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal User Pairing for Asymmetric Multi-Way Relay Channels with Pairwise Relaying","sourcePdf":"1852-cl1211-noori.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052445S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6361502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6361502","articleId":"6329473","onlineDate":"11 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6329474,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, South East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38515881200"},{"name":"Julian Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277386100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6329474","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":871},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive optics","Differential phase shift keying","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","error statistics","optical communication","optical modulation","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent free-space optical communication system","lognormal-Rician turbulence channels","Pad\u00e9 approximants","closed-form BER expressions","maximum ratio combining","binary differential phase-shift keying","selection combing receptions","asymptotic error rate analyses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent free-space optical communications","lognormal-Rician turbulence channels","Pad'e approximation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329474","abstract":"A coherent free-space optical communication system is analyzed for lognormal-Rician turbulence channels using Pad\u00e9 approximants.

Malaysia has a good surveillance system but there have been insufficient findings on suitable model to predict future outbreaks. While there are previous studies on dengue prediction models in Malaysia, unfortunately some of these models still have constraints in finding good parameter with high accuracy. The aim of this paper is to design a more promising model for predicting dengue outbreak by using a hybrid model based on genetic algorithm for the determination of weight in neural network model. Several model architectures are designed and the parameters are adjusted to achieve optimal prediction performance. Sample data that covers dengue and rainfall data of five districts in Selangor collected from State Health Department of Selangor (SHD) and Malaysian Meteorological Department is used as a case study to evaluate the proposed model. However, due to incomplete collection of real data, a sample data with similar behavior was created for the purpose of preliminary experiment. The result shows that the hybrid model produces the better prediction compared to standalone models.","doi":"10.1109/DMO.2012.6329793","startPage":"23","endPage":"27","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6322848/6329780/06329793.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 4th Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DMO.2012.6329793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6329780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid model using genetic algorithm and neural network for predicting dengue outbreak","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Data models","Forecasting","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","genetic algorithms","medical computing","neural nets","rain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid model","genetic algorithm","neural network model","dengue outbreak prediction","infectious disease","weight determination","optimal prediction performance","dengue data","rainfall data","State Health Department of Selangor","SHD","Malaysian Meteorological Department"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid model","genetic algorithm","neural network","prediction","dengue outbreak"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid model using genetic algorithm and neural network for predicting dengue outbreak","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329793/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2012","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13061712","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid model using genetic algorithm and neural network for predicting dengue outbreak","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"13400111111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069244S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6322848","isNumber":"6329780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6322848","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6329780","articleId":"6329793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6329802,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Imran","affiliation":["FSKTM, Universiti Tun Hussein onn Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Imran","id":"37528391600"},{"name":"Rathiah Hashim","affiliation":["FSKTM, Universiti Tun Hussein onn Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rathiah","lastName":"Hashim","id":"37399989600"},{"name":"Noor Elaiza Abd Khalid","affiliation":["FSKM, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Noor Elaiza Abd","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37400104100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2718-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2717-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6938"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6946"}],"articleNumber":"6329802","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Benchmark testing","Sociology","Statistics","Equations","Optimization","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","statistical distributions","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opposition based particle swarm optimization","student T mutation","OSTPSO","stochastic algorithm","optimization problem","premature convergence","convergence acceleration","early convergence","student T distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","student T distribution","modified PSO","PSO with student T distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329802","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic algorithm, used for the optimization problems, proposed by Kennedy [1] in 1995.

When information is collected from sparse sensors, the acquired data is limited in terms of radial and angular sampling of the imaged slice. To overcome this problem, we demonstrate an efficient solution based on the parallel implementation of the sinogram recovery algorithm (SRA) for limited views in its variant based on the calculation of the coordinates of the center of mass (CoMs) of the subject under test, rather than performing the complete sinogram restoration. By introducing a modification in the existing SRA, we achieve high parallelization of each stage, making it ideal for implementation in hardware accelerated systems, such as field programmable gate arrays. The potential to parallelize the SRA is first studied in MATLAB, by processing all data projections concurrently and verifying performance by matching the results from the parallel and sequential implementations. Furthermore, the algorithm is coded in very high speed integrated circuits hardware description language, which is implemented and tested on a Xilinx Virtex 6 board. We report speedups of between three and four orders of magnitude, whereas the errors in CoMs' coordinates are reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6409978/06329924.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2224654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2224654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6409978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel-Data Reconstruction for Limited Views Tomography Sensors by Sinusoidal Hough Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Sensors","Parallel processing","Tomography","Field programmable gate arrays","Transforms","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","Hough transforms","image coding","image matching","image reconstruction","image sampling","image sensors","mathematics computing","very high speed integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel-data reconstruction","limited view tomography sensor","sinusoidal Hough transform","industrial environment","imaging process tomography","information collection","imaged slice angular sampling","imaged slice radial sampling","sinogram recovery algorithm","SRA","center of mass","CoMs","sinogram restoration","hardware accelerated system","field programmable gate array","MATLAB processing","data projection","hardware description language","very high speed integrated circuit","Xilinx Virtex 6 board implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field programmable gate array (FPGA)","Hough transform","parallel algorithm","sinogram recovery","tomography","very high speed integrated circuits hardware description language (VHDL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Parallel-Data Reconstruction for Limited Views Tomography Sensors by Sinusoidal Hough Transform","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6329924/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219995","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel-Data Reconstruction for Limited Views Tomography Sensors by Sinusoidal Hough Transform","sourcePdf":"jsen-cantoralceballos-2224654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073884S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6409978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6409978","articleId":"6329924","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6329933,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Elad","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Elad","id":"37283273600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6329933","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2427},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Mathematical model","Information representation","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data models","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundant representation modeling","sparse representation modeling","signal processing","data models","mathematical constructions","data source","dimensionality reduction","IEEE-SPL EDICS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data models","dimensionality reduction","sparse and redundant representations","projection","pursuit"]}],"abstract":"Signal processing relies heavily on data models; these are mathematical constructions imposed on the data source that force a dimensionality reduction of some sort.

It is shown that Fe doping results in an inherent but relatively minor contribution to dispersion under pulse conditions. This simulation is in reasonable quantitative agreement with double pulse experiments. Simulations using deep-level intrinsic growth defects produced a similar result. By contrast, carbon can induce a strong CC which is dependent on doping density. The difference is attributed to whether the trap levels, whether intrinsic or extrinsic dopants, result in a resistive n-type buffer or a p-type floating buffer with bias-dependent depletion regions. This insight provides a key design concept for compensation schemes needed to ensure semi-insulating buffer doping for either RF or power applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6353354/06329946.pdf","startPage":"3327","endPage":"3333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2012.2216535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2012.2216535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353354","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer Design to Minimize Current Collapse in GaN/AlGaN HFETs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doping","Dispersion","Gallium nitride","Logic gates","Semiconductor process modeling","Aluminum gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffusion","doping","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer design","current collapse","GaN/AlGaN HFET","bulk trap-induced component","GaN/AlGaN heterojunction field-effect transistors","drift diffusion simulation","acceptor traps","pulse conditions","double pulse experiments","deep-level intrinsic growth defects","doping density","resistive n-type buffer","p-type floating buffer","bias-dependent depletion regions","design concept","compensation schemes","semiinsulating buffer doping","RF applications","power applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dispersion","dynamic $I$ \u2013$V$ analysis (DIVA)","HEMT","pulse IV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Buffer Design to Minimize Current Collapse in GaN/AlGaN HFETs","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6329946/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136085","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer Design to Minimize Current Collapse in GaN/AlGaN HFETs","sourcePdf":"ted-uren-2216535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068731S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6353354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"202","xplore-issue":"6353354","articleId":"6329946","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6329947,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Baskourelos","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Baskourelos","id":"38529169100"},{"name":"Theodoros Samaras","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Theodoros","lastName":"Samaras","id":"37266143000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"6329947","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Moment methods","Dipole antennas","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","finite difference time-domain analysis","iterative methods","method of moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative FDTD-MoM technique","coupling effects","base-station antennas","finite-difference time-domain","method of moments","base-station antenna","numerical model","commercially available array","numerical phantom","Rao-Wilton-Glisson triangular elements","RWG triangular elements","surface currents","total-field scattered-field formulation","iterative procedure","iterative approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Base-station antennas","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","iterative numerical technique","method of moments (MoM)","occupational exposure","safety limits"]}],"abstract":"In this study, we used an iterative numerical technique, which combines the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with the method of moments (MoM), to investigate the coupling effect between a base-station antenna operating at 900 MHz and a worker in front of it. The numerical model of the antenna was a realistic representation of a commercially available array of dipoles, whereas for the worker a numerical phantom at 5 mm resolution, created from medical imaging of an adult male, was used. Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) triangular elements were employed in the implementation of the MoM used to solve for the surface currents on the antenna structure. The total-field scattered-field formulation of FDTD was used in the computational domain, which contained the numerical phantom of the worker. An intermediate Huygens surface was introduced to establish an iterative procedure, which allowed us to calculate the influence of the human body on the radiating dipoles. It was found that using this iterative approach the whole body absorption near the antenna varied from the case when no coupling was considered.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2012.2220972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/6373893/06329947.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2012.2220972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373893","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative FDTD/MoM Technique for Assessing Coupling Effects in Front of Base-Station Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative FDTD/MoM Technique for Assessing Coupling Effects in Front of Base-Station Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13169690","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6329947/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative FDTD/MoM Technique for Assessing Coupling Effects in Front of Base-Station Antennas","sourcePdf":"temc-samaras-2220972-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103626S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6373893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6373893","articleId":"6329947","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6329948,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Autonomous System and Network Control, College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6572863/6329948/6329948-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Li (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201909) received the Dr. Eng. degree in mechatronics from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent systems, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan.

Different from previous works on bilateral teleoperation systems, this paper addresses dual-master trilateral control of a single holonomic-constrained robotic manipulator, where the communication delays are modeled as multiple Markov chains, and the motion/force controls are investigated under consideration of unsymmetric stochastic time-varying delays and system dynamical uncertainties. Using partial feedback linearization, the whole trilateral teleoperation system, which consists of both master and slave manipulator dynamics, is transformed into three subsystems. By integrating Markov jump systems to handle random delays, adaptive fuzzy control strategies are developed for the nonlinear teleoperators with modeling uncertainties and external disturbances by using the approximation property of the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). It is proven that the trilateral teleoperation system is stochastically stable in mean square under specific linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions, and all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. The proposed scheme is validated by extensive simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6572863/06329948.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2224116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2224116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6572863","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trilateral Teleoperation of Adaptive Fuzzy Force/Motion Control for Nonlinear Teleoperators With Communication Random Delays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Force","Robot kinematics","Markov processes","Uncertainty","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","delays","force control","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities","manipulator dynamics","Markov processes","mean square error methods","motion control","nonlinear control systems","telecontrol","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy force-motion control","nonlinear teleoperators","communication random delays","trilateral teleoperation systems","dual master single slave configuration","stochastic time-varying delays","bilateral teleoperation systems","single holonomic constrained robotic manipulator","multiple Markov chains","partial feedback linearization","slave manipulator dynamics","integrating Markov jump systems","adaptive fuzzy control strategies","approximation property","fuzzy logic systems","FLS","trilateral teleoperation system","mean square error methods","linear matrix inequality","LMI","closed-loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control","random delays","teleoperators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Trilateral Teleoperation of Adaptive Fuzzy Force/Motion Control for Nonlinear Teleoperators With Communication Random Delays","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6329948/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13692644","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trilateral Teleoperation of Adaptive Fuzzy Force/Motion Control for Nonlinear Teleoperators With Communication Random Delays","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-li-2224116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122174S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6572863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6572863","articleId":"6329948","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6329949,"authors":[{"name":"Marija M.

This trend is more obvious in the telecommunications industry, where companies become increasingly digitalized. Customer churn prediction is a main feature of in modern telecomcommunication CRM systems. This research conducts a real-world study on customer churn prediction and proposes the use of boosting to enhance a customer churn prediction model. Unlike most research that uses boosting as a method to boost the accuracy of a given basis learner, this paper tries to separate customers into two clusters based on the weight assigned by the boosting algorithm. As a result, a higher risk customer cluster has been identified. Logistic regression is used in this research as a basis learner, and a churn prediction model is built on each cluster, respectively. The result is compared with a single logistic regression model. Experimental evaluation reveals that boosting also provides a good separation of churn data; thus, boosting is suggested for churn prediction analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Boosting","Logistics","Training","Classification algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer relationship management","data handling","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis","telecommunication industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer churn prediction model","boosting algorithm","digital customer relationship management systems","telecommunications industry","telecommunication CRM systems","customer cluster","logistic regression model","churn data separation","churn prediction analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boosting","churn prediction","customer relationship management","digital marketing","logistic regression","telecommunication"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2224355","startPage":"1659","endPage":"1665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6809862/06329952.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2224355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Customer Churn Prediction Model in Telecom Industry Using Boosting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Customer Churn Prediction Model in Telecom Industry Using Boosting","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14267590","publicationDate":"May 2014","volume":"10","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329952/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Customer Churn Prediction Model in Telecom Industry Using Boosting","sourcePdf":"tii-lu-2224355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06164S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6809862","articleId":"6329952","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6329964,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6357363/6329964/6329964-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ke Lu received the B.S. degree in thermal power engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 1996 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer application technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

In this paper, a neural network (NN)-based online simultaneous policy update algorithm (SPUA) is developed to solve the HJI equation, in which knowledge of internal system dynamics is not required. First, we propose an online SPUA which can be viewed as a reinforcement learning technique for two players to learn their optimal actions in an unknown environment. The proposed online SPUA updates control and disturbance policies simultaneously; thus, only one iterative loop is needed. Second, the convergence of the online SPUA is established by proving that it is mathematically equivalent to Newton's method for finding a fixed point in a Banach space. Third, we develop an actor-critic structure for the implementation of the online SPUA, in which only one critic NN is needed for approximating the cost function, and a least-square method is given for estimating the NN weight parameters. Finally, simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2217349","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1895","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6357285/06329970.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2217349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based Online Simultaneous Policy Update Algorithm for Solving the HJI Equation in Nonlinear - Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Mathematical model","Approximation methods","Artificial neural networks","Convergence","Optimal control","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Banach spaces","H\u221e control","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","neurocontrollers","Newton method","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear differential equations","parameter estimation","partial differential equations","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based online simultaneous policy update algorithm","HJI equation","nonlinear H\u221e state feedback control problem","Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation","nonlinear partial differential equation","NN weight parameter estimation","reinforcement learning technique","iterative loop","online SPUA","Newton method","Banach space","actor-critic structure","cost function","least-square method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["$H_{\\infty}$ state feedback control","Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Isaacs equation","neural network","online","simultaneous policy update algorithm"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Online Simultaneous Policy Update Algorithm for Solving the HJI Equation in Nonlinear <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$H_{\\infty}$</tex></formula> Control","volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6329970/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136628","pubMedId":"24808144","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Online Simultaneous Policy Update Algorithm for Solving the HJI Equation in Nonlinear <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$H_{\\infty}$</tex></formula> Control","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wu-2217349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183287S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6357285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6357285","articleId":"6329970","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6329989,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Signal Processing and VLSI Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6392234/6329989/6329989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Wang received the B.S. degree from Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China, in 2006, and the M.Eng. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2009.

The most common approach to truncation includes physical reduction of the partial product matrix and a compensation for the reduced bits via different hardware compensation subcircuits. However, this results in fixed systems optimized for a given application at design time. A novel approach to truncation is proposed, where a full precision multiplier is implemented, but the active section of the partial product matrix is selected dynamically at run-time. This allows a power reduction tradeoff against signal degradation which can be modified at run time. Such an architecture brings together the power reduction benefits from truncated multipliers and the flexibility of reconfigurable and general purpose devices. Efficient implementation of such a multiplier is presented in a custom digital signal processor where the concept of software compensation is introduced and analyzed for different applications. Experimental results and power measurements are studied, including power measurements from both post-synthesis simulations and a fabricated IC implementation. This is the first system-level DSP core using a fine-grain truncated multiplier. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the programmable truncated MAC (PTMAC) in achieving power reduction, with minimum impact on functionality for a number of applications. Software compensation is also shown to be effective when deploying truncated multipliers in a system.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2189059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6339093/06329993.pdf","startPage":"2555","endPage":"2568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2189059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible Low Power DSP With a Programmable Truncated Multiplier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Low Power DSP With a Programmable Truncated Multiplier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329993/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13100478","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6329993/","volume":"59","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Low Power DSP With a Programmable Truncated Multiplier","sourcePdf":"tcsi-delaguiasolaz-2189059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189916S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6339093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6339093","articleId":"6329993","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6329994,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwu Tao","affiliation":["PowerManagement Research Laboratory (PMRL), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6359940/6329994/6329994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengwu Tao received the B.

Averaging the intermediate variables among one short preamble period improves the estimation accuracy under conditions where I/Q mismatch is large.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6339093/06329998.pdf","startPage":"2795","endPage":"2798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6329998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comments on \u201cEstimation of Carrier Frequency Offset With I/Q Mismatch Using Pseudo-Offset Injection in OFDM Systems\u201d","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","I/Q mismatch","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6329998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Comments on \u201cEstimation of Carrier Frequency Offset With I/Q Mismatch Using Pseudo-Offset Injection in OFDM Systems\u201d","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6329998/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comments on \u201cEstimation of Carrier Frequency Offset With I/Q Mismatch Using Pseudo-Offset Injection in OFDM Systems\u201d","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wang-2206493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037502S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6339093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"6339093","articleId":"6329998","onlineDate":"12 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
