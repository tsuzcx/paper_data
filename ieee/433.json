Under normal bias, the parasitic SCR is in its blocking state but, if subjected to a large voltage spike or if exposed to an ionizing environment, triggering may occur. This may result in device burn-out or loss of state. The problem has been extensively studied for space and weapons applications. Prevention of latch-up has been achieved in conservative design (~9 \u03bcm p-well depths) by the use of minority lifetime control methods such as gold doping and neutron irradiation and by modifying the base transport factor with buried layers. The push toward VLSI densities will enhance parasitic action sufficiently so that the problem will become of more universal concern. This paper will survey latch-up control methods presently employed for weapons and space applications on present (~9 \u03bcm p-well) CMOS and will indicate the extent of their applicability to VLSI designs.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4330205/04330274.pdf","startPage":"5065","endPage":"5068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latch-Up Control in CMOS Integrated Circuits","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1979.4330274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4330205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1979.4330274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4330274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4330274/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Latch-Up Control in CMOS Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latch-Up Control in CMOS Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"TNS-v26-n6-69.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041294S","chronDate":"Dec.  1979","isNumber":"4330205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4330274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4330275,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This is especially true for bulk CMOS integrated circuits in which parasitic vertical NPN and lateral PNP bipolars are connected in an SCR fashion. One method for preventing latch-up is lifetime control utilizing neutron irradiation. This work characterizes the long-term annealing of neutron irradiation induced changes in the parasitic bipolar gains of MOS/LSI integrated circuits. A theoretical model, which fits both isothermal and isochronal annealing data, is used to characterize the annealing. Using this model, a procedure has been established for neutron irradiation of LSI integrated circuits which will guarantee that latch-up will not occur during the normal lifetime of the circuits. A detailed discussion of the procedure employed for neutron irradiation of integrated circuits is given, and the results of this procedure applied to several thousand MSI and LSI circuits are described.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1979.4330275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4330205/04330275.pdf","startPage":"5069","endPage":"5073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1979.4330275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4330205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4330275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neutron Irradiation for Prevention of Latch-Up in MOS Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4330275/","displayDocTitle":"Neutron Irradiation for Prevention of Latch-Up in MOS Integrated Circuits","volume":"26","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neutron Irradiation for Prevention of Latch-Up in MOS Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"TNS-v26-n6-70.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036202S","chronDate":"Dec.  1979","isNumber":"4330205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4330275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4330524,"authors":[{"name":"Eiichi Tanaka","affiliation":["National Institute for Radiological Sciences, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiichi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37268154700"},{"name":"Norimasa Nohara","affiliation":["National Institute for Radiological Sciences, Japan"],"firstName":"Norimasa","lastName":"Nohara","id":"37713684700"},{"name":"Mikio Yamamoto","affiliation":["National Institute for Radiological Sciences, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikio","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37715784600"},{"name":"Takehiro Tomitani","affiliation":["National Institute for Radiological Sciences, Japan"],"firstName":"Takehiro","lastName":"Tomitani","id":"37267945500"},{"name":"Hideo Murayama","affiliation":["National Institute for Radiological Sciences, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Murayama","id":"37268465800"},{"name":"Kenji Ishimatsu","affiliation":["Hitachi Medical Corporation Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Ishimatsu","id":"37721091600"},{"name":"Katsumi Takami","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsumi","lastName":"Takami","id":"37306998600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4330524","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":28},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Positrons","Electrical capacitance tomography","Sampling methods","Sensor arrays","Image sampling","Motion detection","Event detection","Iterative methods","Biomedical imaging"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\"Positology\"-the search for suitable detector arrangements for a positron ECT with continuous rotation","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1979.4330524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4330502","endPage":"2731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4330502/04330524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1979.4330524","startPage":"2728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4330524","abstract":"This paper proposes a continuously rotating positron ECT system, in which the detectors are arranged on a circular ring with \"non-uniform\" spacing so as to provide much finer sampling interval in the projections than the conventional circular ring system.

This approach is discussed and some experimental results in its favor are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to the Emission Computerized Tomography Problem: Simultaneous Calculation of Attenuation and Activity Coefficients","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1979.4330535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4330502/04330535.pdf","startPage":"2775","endPage":"2779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1979.4330535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4330502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4330535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4330535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1979","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to the Emission Computerized Tomography Problem: Simultaneous Calculation of Attenuation and Activity Coefficients","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"April 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to the Emission Computerized Tomography Problem: Simultaneous Calculation of Attenuation and Activity Coefficients","sourcePdf":"TNS-v26-n8-33.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043152S","chronDate":"April  1979","isNumber":"4330502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"115","articleId":"4330535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4330638,"authors":[{"name":"Klaus Halbach","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Halbach","id":"37347797300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4330638","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"abstract":"General properties as well as specific configurations of a new family of strong Rare Earth Cobalt quadrupoles are discussed.

This paper extends the work to a wider range of currently used transistor types and amplifiers with applications ranging from low noise front-end to class C power output amplifiers. Two types of hEE degradation have been identified viz. \"permanent and room-rtemperature current dependent \"recoverable\". Both types of degradation have been found throughout the range of transistor types and it is shown that they can also be simulated by avalanching the emitter-base junctions. Class A amplifier performance of all power levels can be directly affected by either type of degradation and a detailed example is given in the more complex case of \"recoverable\" characteristics. Class C amplifiers are not directly affected by cumulative ionizing radiation doses of up to 1 Mrad (Si) or emitter-base avalanche although significant transistor hEE degradation can occur in both cases. One example of microwave performance degradation in a Class B/C amplifier is described to illustrate the only known exception to this rule.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bipolar transistors","Microwave amplifiers","Ionizing radiation","Degradation","Microwave transistors","Microwave devices","Space technology","Low-noise amplifiers","Radiation hardening","Space vehicles"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.1979.4330774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4330566/04330774.pdf","startPage":"4297","endPage":"4306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4330566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1979.4330774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sensitivity of Microwave Bipolar Transistors and Amplifiers to Ionizing Radiation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4330774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Sensitivity of Microwave Bipolar Transistors and Amplifiers to Ionizing Radiation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4330774/","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sensitivity of Microwave Bipolar Transistors and Amplifiers to Ionizing Radiation","sourcePdf":"TNS-v26-n9-208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036499S","chronDate":"June  1979","isNumber":"4330566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4330774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4330889,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Bin Lim","affiliation":["EMI Medical Inc., 4000 Commercial Drive, Northbrook, IL 60062"],"firstName":"Chun Bin","lastName":"Lim","id":"37089086917"},{"name":"Lee Tzuu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine Section,Medical Section, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Lee Tzuu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37714436200"},{"name":"Ronald J.

NaI(Tl) has good light output, and even though it is hygroscopic has found acceptance as a good scintillator. Recently BGO has been shown to satisfy the first two requirements for tomography, and has replaced NaI(Tl) as the detector of choice in tomography. However, its low light yield and poor coincidence timing make it unsuitable for fast scanners. Cesium fluoride (CsF) has been investigated by us as a possible scintillation detector for positron tomography, and shows great promise even though it is extremely hygroscopic and exhibits low scintillation efficiency as compared to NaI(Tl). Its very fast decay time, good detection efficiency, and fast coincidence timing make it an ideal detector for tomographs designed for fast dynamic studies. Moreover, it permits the incorporation of time of flight information with conventional tomography for improved signal to noise ratio in the image.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4330785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1980.4330891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4330785/04330891.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"575","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1980.4330891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cesium Fluoride: A New Detector for Positron Emission Tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1980","displayDocTitle":"Cesium Fluoride: A New Detector for Positron Emission Tomography","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4330891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cesium Fluoride: A New Detector for Positron Emission Tomography","sourcePdf":"TNS-v27-n1-106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098975S","chronDate":"Feb.  1980","isNumber":"4330785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"42","articleId":"4330891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4331022,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Substantial differences are observed in the relative concentration of strained Si-O-Si bridging bonds in the interfacial region and in the distribution of intermediate oxidation states of silicon at the abrupt Si/SiO2 chemical interface. Thin thermal SiO2 films (<80 \u00c5) grown on Si <100> substrates are irradiated with electrons having kinetic energies of 0 to 20 eV during in situ XPS measurements. Straightforward field-effect behavior is observed for electron kinetic energies below 6 eV. Both oxide/vacuum surface states and Si(+3) species at the Si/SiO2 interface are generated and allowed to relax during the course of the measurements. These results are correlated with the presence of a strained layer of SiO2 (~20 \u00c5) at the interface that we had previously reported.

A program has been undertaken to study the characteristics of electrical discharges induced on silverbacked Teflon samples irradiated by a monoenergetic beam of electrons under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. Measurements of breakdown threshold voltages, particle emission and material damage have been made for Teflon samples (75 and 125\u03bcm thick) with selected edges exposed to the electron beam. Measurements indicate a strong dependence of threshold voltage upon the choice of sample edge that is exposed. The Teflon samples exhibit a difference of ~10kV in breakdown threshold voltage depending on the sample orientation. Optical birefringence indicative of long range alignment of the bulk material has been observed along axes which correspond to the axes that define the orientation for maximum and minimum threshold voltages. This result can be significant to spacecraft designers because optical prescreening of Teflon samples may allow optimal choice of material orientation upon the spacecraft to minimize the deleterious effect of dielectric discharges.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4331039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1980.4331103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4331039/04331103.pdf","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1769","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1980.4331103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of Edge Breakdowns on Teflon Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1980","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of Edge Breakdowns on Teflon Samples","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4331103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of Edge Breakdowns on Teflon Samples","sourcePdf":"TNS-v27-n6-64.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024895S","chronDate":"Dec.  1980","isNumber":"4331039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4331103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4331105,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results described here show that the model accurately predicts discharge coupling for simple geometries, but that additional physical processes must be considered for the model to be able to predict the response of reentrant geometries.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4331105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Verification of an ECEMP Spacecraft Discharge Coupling Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Verification of an ECEMP Spacecraft Discharge Coupling Model","sourcePdf":"TNS-v27-n6-66.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047004S","chronDate":"Dec.  1980","isNumber":"4331039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4331105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4331114,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In order to obtain quantitative information such as absolute volumes and regional radionuclide concentrations using SPECT systems it is necessary to determine the system characteristics which contribute to the intrinsic measurement process and limit its precision. This manuscript describes some of the more important physical factors which can affect the measurement process of scintillation camera based SPECT systems and provides information concerning the type of quantitative measurements that can currently be obtained with these devices. Using our rotating camera based SPECT system the root mean square (rms) noise level in attenuation corrected images of a uniform cylindrical source was measured and found to agree with theoretically predicted vaiues obtained with the following equation: %rms = 100 (1.8)3/2 \u03c0 Reff Rs1/2 Abody Cavg / 21/2Ntotal1/2(FF)1/2 where Reff is the \"effective\" radius of the source, RS is the actual source radius, Abody is the attenuation factor for surrounding non-source body material, Cavg is the average attenuation correction factor for the center of the source, Ntotal is the total number of events, and FF is the algorithm filter factor and equals the integral of the square of the spatial frequency filter function. Using a semi-automatic region of interest (ROI) program and the multi-slice capability of our SPECT system, the volumes of plastic spherical sources placed inside a larger cylindrical source were measured.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1981.4331143","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4331124/04331143.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1981.4331143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4331124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Factors Affecting Quantitative Measurements Using Camera-Based Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (Spect)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4331143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Physical Factors Affecting Quantitative Measurements Using Camera-Based Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (Spect)","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Factors Affecting Quantitative Measurements Using Camera-Based Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (Spect)","sourcePdf":"TNS-v28-n1-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051881S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"4331124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"160","articleId":"4331143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4331144,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen E.

The NaI(T1) crystals were 8 mm \u00d7 30 mm \u00d7 50 mm deep, sealed in 10 mm wide stainless steel cans. The BGO crystals are 9.5 mm wide \u00d7 32 mm \u00d7 32 mm deep and as they are not hygroscopic do not require sealed cans. With a shielding gap of 3 cm (section thickness 1.7 cm FWHM) the sensitivity of the BGO system is 55,000 events per sec for 1 \u03bcCi per cm3 in a 20 cm cylinder of water, which is 2.3 times higher than the NaI(T1) system. For a 200 \u03bcCi/cm line source on the ring axis in a 20 cm diameter water cylinder, the BGO system records 86% of the scatter fraction and 66% of the accidental fraction of the NaI(T1) system. The lower light yield and poorer time resolution of BGO requires a wider coincidence timing window than NaI(T1); however, the ability to use full-energy pulse height selection with a 2.3-fold improvement in sensitivity results in an overall reduction in the fraction of accidental events recorded. The in-plane resolution of the BGO system is 9-10 mm FWHM within the central 30 cm diameter field, and the radial elongation at the edge of the field in the NaI(T1) system has been nearly eliminated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4331124/04331144.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1981.4331144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1981.4331144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4331124","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4331144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imaging Properties of a Positron Tomograph with 280 Bgo Crystals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positrons","Crystals","Assembly","Aluminum","Paints","Laboratories","Solid scintillation detectors","Crystalline materials","Photoelectricity","Spraying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4331144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Imaging Properties of a Positron Tomograph with 280 Bgo Crystals","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imaging Properties of a Positron Tomograph with 280 Bgo Crystals","sourcePdf":"TNS-v28-n1-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050104S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"4331124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"76","articleId":"4331144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":4331146,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Ideally, the stored number represents the magnitude of the sampled function at one instant of time. Practically, the stored number is the result of some weighted averaging of the sampled function during a finite time interval. As this acquisition time interval becomes a significant fraction of the sample period, the averaging process degrades the sample-system frequency response. The procedure is reviewed whereby one calculates the frequency response for the class of systems that are linear and time-varying or constant during the acquisition interval. The transfer function is calculated for a sampler that first acts as an RC integrator during the acquisition time, then transfers the accumulated charge to some holding circuit (for A-D conversion), and finally begins to acquire the next sample. Tradeoffs between overshoot and rise time in the design of the system transfer function are shown along with an example of how one can arrive at the desired transfer function by convolution of the samples with a proper waveform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4332269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1983","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 1983","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Response of Finite Aperture Sample-and-Hold Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Response of Finite Aperture Sample-and-Hold Systems","sourcePdf":"TNS-v30-n1-66.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022664S","chronDate":"Feb.  1983","isNumber":"4332203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4332269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4332270,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas E.

It is concluded that if the detectors are close-packed, there is a decreasing incentive in using detectors less than 1 cm in width in a high sensitivity camera designed for head scans.

Results show that agreement in the experimental and theoretical surface to average doses support the use of thermo-luminescent dosimeters (manganese activated calcium fluoride) in specifying the surface dose delivered to thin gate insulators of MOS devices. Annealing measurements indicate the existence of at least two energy levels, or activation energies, for recovery of soft oxide MOS devices after irradiation by electrons, protons, and gammas. Damage sensitivities of MOS devices were found to be independent of combinations and sequences of radiation type or energies. Comparison of various gamma sources indicated a small dependence of damage sensitivity on the Cobalt facility, but a more significant dependence in the case of the Cesium source. These results were attributed to differences in the spectral content of the several sources.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4332654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4332654/04332665.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1983.4332665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1983.4332665","startPage":"1880","endPage":"1884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation Effects on MOS Devices: Dosimetry, Annealing, Irradiation Sequence, and Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4332665/","displayDocTitle":"Radiation Effects on MOS Devices: Dosimetry, Annealing, Irradiation Sequence, and Sources","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"June 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation Effects on MOS Devices: Dosimetry, Annealing, Irradiation Sequence, and Sources","sourcePdf":"TNS-v30-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0374S","chronDate":"June  1983","isNumber":"4332654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4332665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4332667,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Activating this mode of operation leads to a drop in source-to-drain voltage and to a large drain current. Snap-back is not a four-layer (SCR, latch-up) phenomenon, but, like latch-up, can be initiated by current injection into the p-well, by avalanching junctions or by exposure to ionizing radiation. The sustaining voltage can be significantly below the drain-substrate avalanche voltage thereby limiting the maximum operating voltage. In this paper we present a qualitative model for snapback--local conductivity modulation occurring in the intrinsic base region of the parasitic bipolar transistor leading to regenerative feedback.

The results indicated that complex recovery properties controlled the damage sensitivities of the tested parts.

The complex nature of these dependencies make interpretation of LSI device performance in space (exposure to entire electron and proton spectra) difficult, if not impossible, without respective ground tests and analyses. Complete recovery of n-channel shifts was observed, in some cases within hours after irradiation, with equilibrium values of threshold voltages greater than their pre-irradiation values.

Typical failure levels are in the 10-100 Krad(Si) range. Failure was found to be a strong function of irradiation bias and annealing time after irradiation. In addition, total dose \"windows\" below 100 Krad(Si) were observed. The radiation failure mechanism is predominantly inversion of p type silicon either at the bottom of the recessed field oxide, causing buried layer to buried layer channeling, or on the oxide sidewall causing collector to emitter leakage. In addition, a failure mode due to increased sidewall current was observed in a nonisolated form of integrated injection logic. Hardening approaches have been identified and investigated at several manufacturers. Device failure levels were found to vary by several orders of magnitude depending on process lot and layout revision.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4333066/04333111.pdf","startPage":"4216","endPage":"4223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1983.4333111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1983.4333111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4333066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4333111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total Dose Effects in Recessed Oxide Digital Bipolar Microcircuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Silicon","Radiation hardening","Transistors","Ice","Weapons","Cranes","Annealing","Logic devices","Manufacturing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Total Dose Effects in Recessed Oxide Digital Bipolar Microcircuits","volume":"30","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total Dose Effects in Recessed Oxide Digital Bipolar Microcircuits","sourcePdf":"TNS-v30-n6-45.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024733S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"4333066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"48","articleId":"4333111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4333132,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These predictions were compared with threshold-voltage shifts obtained following 60Co irradiations actually performed at these dose rates, and the agreement is excellent. We observed a wide range of annealing rates for commercial and military 4007 inverters--some Al-gate inverters exhibited very little annealing following irradiation, while an Si-gate inverter completely annealed back to its preirradiation threshold voltage in ~5 \u00d7 105 s. The radiation responses of 4007's from a specific manufacturer with different packaging (i.e., plastic or ceramic) and/or electrical characterization (i.e., high-reliability or JAN) were found to vary significantly. Maintaining bias following irradiation was determined to be important in characterizing the anneal of both Al-and Si-gate inverters. Finally, dose-enhancement effects on the threshold-voltage shift were observed for 60Co inpool irradiations where the source and sample were separated by 20 in. of water.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333132/","volume":"30","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Predicting CMOS Inverter Response in Nuclear and Space Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting CMOS Inverter Response in Nuclear and Space Environments","sourcePdf":"TNS-v30-n6-66.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04986S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"4333066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"79","articleId":"4333132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4333138,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Results indicated that qualitatively the same charge recombination effects occurred in hard oxide devices for doses of 105 rads (SiO2) as in soft oxide parts for doses of 1 to 4 krads (SiO2). Consequently, damage equivalency or non-equivalency depended on radiation type and energy. However, recovery effects, both during and after irradiation, controlled relative damage sensitivity and its dependency on total dose, dose rate, supply bias, gate bias, radiation type, and energy. Correction factors can be derived from these data or from similar tests of other hard oxide types, so as to properly evaluate the combined effects of the total space environment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4333066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4333066/04333138.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1983.4333138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1983.4333138","startPage":"4363","endPage":"4367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Damage Equivalence of Electrons, Protons, Alphas and Gamma Rays in Rad-Hard MOS Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333138/","displayDocTitle":"The Damage Equivalence of Electrons, Protons, Alphas and Gamma Rays in Rad-Hard MOS Devices","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Damage Equivalence of Electrons, Protons, Alphas and Gamma Rays in Rad-Hard MOS Devices","sourcePdf":"TNS-v30-n6-72.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035309S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"4333066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4333138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4333141,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The four layer n-p-n-p structures formed from the parasitic pnp and npn transistors comprise a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) which, if properly biased, may be triggered \"ON\" by electrical transients, ionizing radiation or a single heavy ion. This latchup phenomenon might cause loss of functionality or device burnout. For space applications cosmic ray heavy ions are a significant threat and the latchup of a CMOS circuit is a major system concern because of its catastrophic nature. This paper presents the results of testing nineteen different device types from six manufacturers to investigate their latchup sensitivity with argon and krypton beams. The parasitic npnp paths have been generally identified, and a qualitative rationale for latchup susceptibility and a latchup cross section is given for each device type. The correlation between bit-flip sensitivity and latchup susceptibility is also presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1983.4333163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4333066","startPage":"4514","endPage":"4519","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4333066/04333163.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latchup in CMOS Devices from Heavy Ions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Latchup in CMOS Devices from Heavy Ions","publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latchup in CMOS Devices from Heavy Ions","sourcePdf":"TNS-v30-n6-97.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049501S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"4333066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4333163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4333167,"authors":[{"name":"John A.

The modeling resulted in the addition of feedback resistors in the 16K, while the 2K remained tentatively unaltered. Subsequent experiments, using the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories' 88-inch cyclotron to accelerate krypton and oxygen ions, established an upset threshold for the 2K and the 16K without resistance added, as well as a hardening threshold for the 16K with feedback resistance added. Results for the 16K showed it to be hardenable to a higher level than previously published data for other unhardened 16K RAMs. The data agreed fairly well with the modeling results; however, a close look suggests that modification of the simulation methodology is required to accurately predict the resistance necessary to harden the RAM cell.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333184/","volume":"30","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Analytical Models and Experimental Results for Single Event Upset in CMOS SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Analytical Models and Experimental Results for Single Event Upset in CMOS SRAMs","sourcePdf":"TNS-v30-n6-118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06666S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"4333066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"22","articleId":"4333184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4333291,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We are interested in using these devices for high energy physics detectors.","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4333192/04333374.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4333192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1984.4333374","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1984.4333374","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4333374","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Digital TV","Electron tubes","Current measurement","Physics","Particle measurements","Wire","Time measurement","Video recording","Digital recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1984","displayDocTitle":"New Developments in Flash ADC's","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 1984","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Developments in Flash ADC's","sourcePdf":"TNS-v31-n1-182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030643S","chronDate":"Feb.  1984","isNumber":"4333192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4333374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4333458,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Layered structures representative of an n-channel MOSFET drain in a p-well are modeled. TWo major results have been obtained. First, the well structure inherently provides better charge collection at the well-substrate compared to the drain-well junction. Ihis provides single event protection for the drain node. Second, large charge density tracks generated by very high energy particles can forward bias the drain-well junction resulting in bipolar action from the inherent parasitic n-p-n transistor of the well structure. This bipolar current is opposite to the photocurrent, suggesting a different SEU protection mechanism. However, it opens the possibility of upset of the \"on\" n-channel and, most critically, provides a mechanism for triggering latch-up in CMOS circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1984.4333474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4333440/04333474.pdf","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1984.4333474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4333440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Simulation of Single Event Indujced Bipolar Current in CMOS Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4333474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333474/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Simulation of Single Event Indujced Bipolar Current in CMOS Structures","volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Simulation of Single Event Indujced Bipolar Current in CMOS Structures","sourcePdf":"TNS-v31-n6-34.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031612S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"4333440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"23","articleId":"4333474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4333476,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Previous studies have found that for relatively thick oxides (greater than 20 nm) the flatband voltage changes with radiation dose as the square of the oxide thickness suggesting that the holes created by the ionizing radiation in the oxide are uniformly created and trapped. For the thinner oxides examined in the present work, significantly smaller shifts than predicted by the oxide thickness squared dependence were observed indicating that many of the generated holes are escaping the thin oxide.

The dose rate effect was that a lower dose rate produced less net damage than an eqivalent total dose applied at a higher rate. The HM1-6514 showed essentially no dose rate effect and no annealing of damage, and the MWS 5114 exhibited a moderate effect with some annealing.

The purpose of this study was to determine the total-dose and doserate dependence of threshold voltage shifts, both during and immediately after irradiation and over extended periods of time thereafter. Post-rad bias conditions were the same as during bombardment. The results suggest that previous measurements [1, 2], which indicated that post irradiation changes of voltage shifts depended on type of radiation source and on energy of particles, were essentially due to the unique combinations of total dose and dose rate applied in those experiments. It now appears, that all of the damage effects observed in the previous experiments for the various sources and energies, during and after irradiation, could be simulated by selected equivalent doses and dose rates with any radiation source or particle energy. The importance of this conclusion is that a key relationship of Co60 damage effects to those from any other radiation source could be experimentally determined in terms of total dose and dose rate alone. Consequently, a valid simulation of specific charged particle and energy effects of the space radiation environment may be accomplished on the ground with appropriately designed Co60 tests.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1984.4333527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4333440/04333527.pdf","startPage":"1444","endPage":"1447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1984.4333527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4333440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total-Dose and Dose-Rate Dependence of Proton Damage in MOS Devices during and after Irradiation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4333527/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Total-Dose and Dose-Rate Dependence of Proton Damage in MOS Devices during and after Irradiation","volume":"31","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-Dose and Dose-Rate Dependence of Proton Damage in MOS Devices during and after Irradiation","sourcePdf":"TNS-v31-n6-87.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032667S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"4333440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"16","articleId":"4333527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4333529,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The technique involves (1) fabricating MOS capacitors on control wafers that can be \"pulled\" at different stages during the fabrication process, and (2) defining \"hardness\" in terms of the amount of radiation-induced charge. We demonstrate the use of this technique in monitoring radiation hardness before and after key process steps, as well as in determining the cumulative effects of many process steps on hardness. It is shown that the optimum temperature for gate oxidation in dry O2 is 1000\u00b0C for both Al- and Si-gate technologies. In addition, In-Source evaporated Al is a preferred process step over sputtered Al deposition for an Al-gate technology. By choosing process steps that optimize hardness, the hardness of parts fabricated using a Si-gate CMOS process can be increased by over an order of magnitude. Finally, we report a different electric field dependence for the buildup of interface states in Alversus Si-gate technologies.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4334049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334025/04334049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4334049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334025","startPage":"3953","endPage":"3960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing and Controlling the Radiation Hardness of a Si-Gate CMOS Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing and Controlling the Radiation Hardness of a Si-Gate CMOS Process","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing and Controlling the Radiation Hardness of a Si-Gate CMOS Process","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n6-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03845S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4334025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"69","articleId":"4334049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4334053,"authors":[{"name":"Fred W.

The individual components of radiation induced charge, oxide-trapped charge and interface-state charge, are separated using a subthreshold current technique. Processing splits and post-irradiation biased anneals are used to vary the ratio of oxide-trapped charge to interface-state charge. It is shown that the effective channel mobility depends to first order on the interface-state charge density. Static power supply current is correlated with the n-channel leakage at zero gate voltage while output drive currents are a function of both threshold voltage and channel mobility. Changes in propagation delay of signals through integrated circuits can be understood when both mobility and threshold voltage are considered as a function of the bias dependent charge buildup. A new transistor switching time figure of merit, t/C, which measures the drain to source drive over a full logic level voltage swing at the drain node, is introduced. This index is then shown to correlate with propagation delay in an IC. Finally, performance changes in an IC are modeled using only the measured buildup of oxide-trapped and interface-state charges from transistors as a function of radiation.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4334053","startPage":"3975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334025/04334053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4334053","endPage":"3981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation of Radiation Effects in Transistors and Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Correlation of Radiation Effects in Transistors and Integrated Circuits","volume":"32","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation of Radiation Effects in Transistors and Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n6-28.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05102S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4334025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"128","articleId":"4334053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4334057,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The concept of a resistive-like ion track shunt bridging two like conductivity regions is introduced and a first-order-model developed for the charge transported along the ion track shunt. This model is shown to be consistent with charge collection measurements on multi-junction CMOS-like structures. It is found that the charge collection at a given p-n junction is influenced and can even be changed in sign by voltages present at a second p-n junction when the ion track penetrates both junctions. This has important consequences for the design of radiation hard integrated circuits and such ion track shunt effects become more important as device dimensions are scaled to smaller values.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4334078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334025/04334078.pdf","startPage":"4115","endPage":"4121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4334078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ion Track Shunt Effects in Multi-Junction Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334078/","displayDocTitle":"Ion Track Shunt Effects in Multi-Junction Structures","volume":"32","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ion Track Shunt Effects in Multi-Junction Structures","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n6-53.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035235S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4334025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"58","articleId":"4334078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4334079,"authors":[{"name":"Richard L.

Cells were simulated using a GaAs MESFET/JFET model incorporated into SPICE. Two device locations have been determined to be vulnerable to single event hits: the gate-to-drain junction and the source-to-drain channel region. Upset caused by source-to-drain charge injection in C-EJFET cells is similar to upsets in CMOS static RAMs. Gate-to-drain charge injection not a problem in CMOS RAMs, is an additional upset mechanism in GaAs RAMs. The critical charge for such hits is lower than the source-to-drain critical charge for upset. Determination of which mechanism dominates upset requires further examination. Resistor-coupled complementary designs were studied as a possible hardening approach. The dependence of critical charge on simulated pulse decay time has also been studied. The critical charge for the unprotected GaAs SRAM upset is comparable to that of Si SRAMs of equal line widths. Finally, soft error rates have been estimated for two GaAs SRAM designs.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334025/04334088.pdf","startPage":"4170","endPage":"4175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Single Events in GaAs SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4334088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4334088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Single Events in GaAs SRAMs","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Single Events in GaAs SRAMs","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n6-63.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035326S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4334025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4334088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4334089,"authors":[{"name":"James C.

Long-term annealing data for single events are used in conjunction with previous macroscopic short-term annealing results to predict the early-time impact of individual damaged regions.

Some of the specific products developed by the hardness assurance community are American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for electrical tests and radiation dosimetry, guideline documents for device and system hardness assurance, and military handbooks, test standards, and hardness-assured-device specifications. This paper presents a summary of how these radiation hardness assurance developments were achieved; provides an overview of the guidelines, standards, specifications, and handbooks which have been developed; describes the existing, relevant committees and their purposes; outlines the program status; and discusses plans for the hardness assurance program. The most significant accomplishment for the hardness assurance community is the recent adoption of a scheme for military-standard (MIL-STD) specifications for radiation-hardness-assured electronic devices. Under this scheme, the General Specifications, MIL-M-38510 (microcircuits) and MIL-S-19500 (discretes), have been modified to include options for procurement of devices with assured responses to total ionizing dose and to neutron fluence. Soon to be published are detailed specifications for over 400 radiation-hardness-assured semiconductor devices.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4334100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334025/04334100.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4334100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"4229","endPage":"4236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation Hardness Assurance for Electronic Parts: Accomplishments and Plans","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Radiation Hardness Assurance for Electronic Parts: Accomplishments and Plans","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334100/","volume":"32","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation Hardness Assurance for Electronic Parts: Accomplishments and Plans","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n6-75.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039994S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4334025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4334100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4334105,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Comparison of electrons to Co-60 showed that for equal absorbed doses, the damage produced was equivalent for all bias conditions. Under zero gate bias conditions, 2 to 22 MeV protons also produced damage in the test devices that was equivalent to Co-60. However, under bias conditions for high drain-source currents, the damage for protons below 22 MeV was always less than Co-60 (the lower the proton energy, the less the damage). The 0.5 MeV proton data showed poor correlation with Co-60 results. No dose-rate dependence was observed in the data.

These studies provide important data and valuable insights into the radiation responses of this least complex type of MOS transistor to the different ions employed. For the heavy-ion irradiations under positive gate bias, charge recombination in the oxide was so pronounced that the threshold voltage shifts per unit dose were only a few percent of those measured for the proton exposures. The data also indicate that the heavier ions do considerable radiation damage in both the oxide and the channel that is markedly different than that observed for Co-60 or energetic proton irradiations. These differences in addition to being of fundamental importance raise the question of the suitability of employing heavy ions in certain kinds of device testing.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4334131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334025/04334131.pdf","startPage":"4399","endPage":"4404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4334131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proton and Heavy-Ion Radiation Damage Studies in MOS Transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Proton and Heavy-Ion Radiation Damage Studies in MOS Transistors","volume":"32","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proton and Heavy-Ion Radiation Damage Studies in MOS Transistors","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n6-106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049801S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4334025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"29","articleId":"4334131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4334137,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A commercially processed LSI SOI memory, a 4K \u00d7 1 SRAM on SIMOX, was tested for SEU, and transient ionizing radiation effects as a function of bias conditions and dose rate. The SEU error rate was found to be between 1.5 and 2.5 \u00d7 10-8 errors/bit-day for the 10% worst-case orbit model. The output voltage logic upset level was greater than 1.6 \u00d7 1010 rad(Si)/sec for Vcc supply voltage variations of -10% and +20% with Vsub at -10 V. For the discrete devices and memory, the measured transient photocurrents were larger than the calculated volumetric photocurrent generated in the active device region. This increased transient response is postulated to be due to the gain of the parasitic phototransistor of the dielectrically isolated MOS device.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Radiation Effects in SOI Memories","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4334137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334025/04334137.pdf","startPage":"4431","endPage":"4437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4334137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334025","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Transient Radiation Effects in SOI Memories","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Radiation Effects in SOI Memories","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n6-112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03392S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4334025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"60","articleId":"4334137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4334521,"authors":[{"name":"Donald L.

In contrast to results obtained by previous workers, we find that for metal gate devices there can be a significant \"prompt\" component of interface-state buildup. This prompt component is accompanied by a slow buildup of interface-states, which is still increasing at 500 sec., and is similar to what has been observed previously. For polysilicon gate capacitors there is a time dependent component of interface-state generation that is considerably more rapid than for metal gate devices. The time dependent component of interface-state generation for polysilicon gate capacitors begins within 10 msec after a pulse of radiation and is more than 50 percent complete by 1 sec. The rapid buildup of interface-states for polysilicon gate devices, and the prompt component for metal gate devices, will affect the electrical response of MOS devices in a weapon environment. The existence of more than one component of interface-state buildup indicates that more than one mechanism may be responsible for interface-state generation.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4334575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334557/04334575.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4334575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334557","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation-Induced Interface-State Generation in MOS Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-Induced Interface-State Generation in MOS Devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-Induced Interface-State Generation in MOS Devices","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n6-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059998S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4334557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"45","articleId":"4334575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4334578,"authors":[{"name":"Michael L.

It was found that compressive stress on the SiO2/Si interfacial region reduces both positive charge build-up and interface-trap generation. The positive charge build-up exhibits a smaller stress effect, as compared with the interface-trap generation. The magnitude of stress effect depends only on the compressive strength, and not on the silicide material, if the annealing conditions are the same. In addition, as the gate-oxide thickness decreases, the stress effect on positive charge build-up increases, while the interface-trap generation remains nearly constant. These results can be explained on the basis of the bond reformation process, i. e., in a region where compressive stress exists, the broken bonds are reformed with high probability. Futhermore, radiation response of MOS transistors with different gate-oxide stress values have been evaluated, and compared with those observed in MOS capacitors. Similar stress effects were also obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4334580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334557/04334580.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4334580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334557","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanical Stress Dependence of Radiation Effects in MOS Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mechanical Stress Dependence of Radiation Effects in MOS Structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334580/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical Stress Dependence of Radiation Effects in MOS Structures","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n6-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048877S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4334557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4334580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4334581,"authors":[{"name":"Kikuo Watanabe","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kikuo","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37578682300"},{"name":"Masataka Kato","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Kato","id":"37344810800"},{"name":"Takahiro Okabe","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Okabe","id":"37334324100"},{"name":"Minoru Nagata","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Kokubunji, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Nagata","id":"37325737200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4334581","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation effects","Dielectric films","Interface states","Annealing","Ionizing radiation","Oxidation","Passivation","Dielectric thin films","Dielectric materials","Semiconductor films"]}],"abstract":"Double layer dielectric films are examined for Si surface passivation in a radiation hardened Si device.

A concept of the hole production enhancement factor is introduced as an refinement of the commonly used absorbed dose enhancement factor.

A 10-keV x-ray source was used to irradiate MOS capacitors through a gold/aluminum bilaminate. As expected, the device response when the gold side of the bilaminate faces the device is enhanced strongly with respect to its response when the aluminum side of the bilaminate faces the device. The degree to which the enhanced radiation affects the device response, as determined by the buildup of oxidetrapped charge, depends on the thickness of the gate insulator and the thickness of the capacitor gate in ways similar to those expected from previous work. In addition, striking dependences of the enhanced device response on the energy of the incident radiation, and on the magnitude and direction of the electric field across the gate insulator during the irradiation were observed. These results may provide new insights into the details of the interaction of low-energy radiation with MOS devices.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334557/04334586.pdf","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Response of MOS Devices to Dose-Enhanced Low-Energy Radiation","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4334586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4334586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","displayDocTitle":"The Response of MOS Devices to Dose-Enhanced Low-Energy Radiation","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Response of MOS Devices to Dose-Enhanced Low-Energy Radiation","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n6-29.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050928S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4334557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4334586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4334592,"authors":[{"name":"Edward A.

It is demonstrated that failure dose can be a complicated function of dose rate, and that a peak in the failure-dose versus dose-rate curve generally results when there is a change in failure mode. If only one failure mode exists, then the failure-dose versus doserate curve is monotonic. Implications of proposed changes in MIL-STD-883C, Method 1019.2 are examined in light of their impact on hardness assurance. Our findings support the proposed changes of (1) keeping the time between irradiation and test less than 1 hour and (2) of a more restricted range of dose rate, i.e., 100 to 300 rad(Si)/ s. In addition, it is recommended that zero volt bias be maintained on CMOS devices between irradiation and test. Finally, techniques are presented for relating total-dose hardness as measured in the laboratory to total-dose hardness in real-world space and weapon environments.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4334603","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334557/04334603.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4334603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total-Dose Radiation and Annealing Studies: Implications for Hardness Assurance Testing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Annealing","Laboratories","Circuit testing","CMOS technology","Integrated circuit measurements","Time measurement","Performance evaluation","Space technology","Electric variables measurement","Extraterrestrial measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Total-Dose Radiation and Annealing Studies: Implications for Hardness Assurance Testing","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334603/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-Dose Radiation and Annealing Studies: Implications for Hardness Assurance Testing","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n6-46.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050952S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4334557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"82","articleId":"4334603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4334615,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The imprinted pattern can be restored in the memory by simply exposing the device with the complementary pattern in it to a single pulse with a dose rate in excess of the upset threshold. CMOS/SOS memories of 5T and 6T storage cell design and CMOS/BULK samples were tested for this effect. The Boeing LINAC was used to provide 10 MeV electron pulses of 20 ns width. Results showed that the magnitude of the \"Transient Imprint Memory Effect\" depended on the accumulated dose delivered by radiation pulses.

These cells have been evaluated for critical charges due to gate-to-drain and drain-to-source charge collection. Low gate-to-drain critical charges limit conventional GaAs SRAM soft error rates to approximately 1E-6 errors/bit-day. SEU hardening approaches including decoupling resistors, diodes, and FETs have been investigated. Results predict GaAs RAM cell critical charges can be increased to over 0.1pC. Soft error rates in such hardened memories may approach 1E-7 errors/bit-day without significantly reducing memory speed. Tradeoffs between hardening level, performance and fabrication complexity are discussed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334557/04334647.pdf","startPage":"1590","endPage":"1596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4334647","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4334647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparisons of Single Event Vulnerability of GaAs SRAMS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Comparisons of Single Event Vulnerability of GaAs SRAMS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334647/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","volume":"33","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparisons of Single Event Vulnerability of GaAs SRAMS","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n6-90.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057705S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4334557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4334647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4334648,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Single damage events and damage distributions were measured for an image sensor bombarded with 99- and 147-MeV protons. Increases in dark current density by more than two orders of magnitude were observed for individual damaged cells at relatively low fluences. Results are in good agreement with fundamental proton interaction concepts and with statistical expectations. Interesting phenomena are revealed in a study of room-temperature annealing, including damage production long after irradiation. Comparison of the effects of energetic proton bombardment with those produced by 14-MeV neutron irradiation is made, and similarities and differences are noted. Implications of this work for small-geometry integrated circuits are considered, and the relevance of this investigation to gaining increased understanding of proton damage mechanisms is discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334557/04334648.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4334648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4334648","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permanent Damage Produced by Single Proton Interactions in Silicon Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334648/","displayDocTitle":"Permanent Damage Produced by Single Proton Interactions in Silicon Devices","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permanent Damage Produced by Single Proton Interactions in Silicon Devices","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n6-91.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04495S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4334557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4334648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4334649,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The temperature effect on both cross section and critical linear energy transfer (LET) is explained. The latchup cross section is related to a characteristic length, which is based on the lateral transistor parameters. In this way, the large increase in cross section with temperature is explained. The LET threshold is dependent on the depletion width of the n-substrate p-well junction, which is relatively independent of temperature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOS devices","Inverters","Temperature sensors","CMOS integrated circuits","Energy exchange","Temperature dependence","Threshold voltage","Doping","Charge carrier processes","Electron emission"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334671","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4334671","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334557/04334671.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4334671","startPage":"1714","endPage":"1717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of Single Event Latchup in Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theory of Single Event Latchup in Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Integrated Circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of Single Event Latchup in Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n6-114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021844S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4334557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4334671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4334679,"authors":[{"name":"Richard L.

The dosimeter also returns accurate, high-time-resolution dose measurements. Short-term measurements of dose from three sources, inner radiation belt protons, outer radiation belt electrons and solar flares, are presented for periods in 1984 and 1985. Empirical models of dose rate are constructed for the 840 km altitude of the DMSP orbit and compared to predictions of the NASA models. The NASA model values for proton dose in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) are approximately 50% higher than the DMSP average values. The NASA outer zone electron model prediction values are too high by an average factor of 6, and are not reliable for short-term predictions. Included in the analysis are two of the largest solar proton events of 1984 and 1985 that occurred on 16 February, 1984, and on 26 April, 1984. The February event was relatively short-lived and produced a hard energy spectrum. The April event was much softer but gave a total dose behind .55 gm/cm2 of aluminum shielding in excess of 25 rad(Si) for the first three days of the event.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1987.4334701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4334694/04334701.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1987.4334701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334694","startPage":"676","endPage":"683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Low-Altitude Dose Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Low-Altitude Dose Measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334701/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Low-Altitude Dose Measurements","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n3-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048002S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"4334694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"60","articleId":"4334701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4334823,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper provides a theoretically sound, yet practical to implement, basis for setting wheeling rates. These wheeling rates are based on marginal costs (determined by losses and effects of line flow and voltage magnitude constraints) adjusted up or down as necessary to account for embedded capital costs (i.e. revenue reconciliation).

Techniques for synchronizing sampling along with a method for obtaining positive sequence phasors from samples are reviewed. Although it is possible to use these direct measurements in conventional state estimation algorithms, considerable advantage accrues if the state estimation is reformulated in terms of direct measurements of phasor voltages and currents. The resulting estimation algorithm involves an admittance like matrix with the sparsity of the admittance matrix. The new matrix is real rather than complex even for small X/R ratios for the lines.

Digital (sampled-data) PI stabilizers as well as analog (continuous-time) PI stabilizers are examined in this paper. Two approaches, viz., the root-locus method and the suboptimal regulator method, are presented for determining the optimal stabilizer gains of the proposed PI stabilizer. The dynamic responses following a step disturbance by digital simulation are obtained by means of three types of stabilizers: the conventional power system stabilizer, the optimal stabilizer and the PI stabilizer. Simulation results show that the proposed PI stabilizer yields better system dynamic performance than the others in the sense of having greater damping in response to a step disturbance. A characteristic feature of the proposed PI stabilizer is that it is very simple for practical implementation, especially in the digital case, as commercial PI controllers have been widely employed by the industry for years.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334898","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4334885/04334898.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Proportional-Integral Power System Stabilizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334898/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Proportional-Integral Power System Stabilizer","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Proportional-Integral Power System Stabilizer","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v1-n2-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048274S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"4334885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"65","articleId":"4334898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4334906,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This method utilizes a thyristor-controlled phase-shifter to modulate the generator active power by injecting a quadrature phase voltage in the system. The rotor speed deviation from the synchronous speed is used as the control signal. An eigenvalue analysis and the complex torque coefficient methods are used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a static phase-shifter for damping SSR. The analytical results are verified by a detailed digital computer study on the first IEEE benchmark for SSR studies, using the BPA's Electro-Magnetic Transients Program (EMTP). The simulation results indicate that injection of 2.4% of the system phase voltage in 4 steps of 0.6%, can suppress all torsional modes of the First IEEE benchmark model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power systems","Voltage","Resonance","Power capacitors","Power system analysis computing","Phase modulation","Power generation","Rotors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4334885/04334906.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping Subsynchronous Oscillations in Power Systems Using a Static Phase-Shifter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Damping Subsynchronous Oscillations in Power Systems Using a Static Phase-Shifter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334906/","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping Subsynchronous Oscillations in Power Systems Using a Static Phase-Shifter","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v1-n2-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03263S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"4334885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4334906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":4334918,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The basic feature of the method is the minimization of the adverse reactive power interactions between the controls and voltage sensitive loads, which tend to reduce the effectiveness of the modulation process. A method for stability analysis, based on linearization techniques and eigenvalue sensitivities, is developed and applied to a typical ac/dc system with non-linearly voltage dependent load. The dynamic performance of the system, both with dc power modulation and power system stabilizer, is evaluated for various operating conditions, different load characteristics and different excitation systems. Finally, a dynamic simulation program is developed and used to obtain the exact transient response of the ac/dc system in the time domain. The simulation results presented in the paper verify the responses predicted from the linear eigenvalue sensitivity analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334918","startPage":"128","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4334885/04334918.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis of a Modulated AC/DC System Using the Eigenvalue Sensitivity Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Power system dynamics","Power system simulation","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Optimal control","Minimization methods","Reactive power control","Voltage control","Linearization techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis of a Modulated AC/DC System Using the Eigenvalue Sensitivity Approach","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis of a Modulated AC/DC System Using the Eigenvalue Sensitivity Approach","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v1-n2-33.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027395S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"4334885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4334918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4334937,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce F.

The knowledge required to perform the task is identified. To alleviate a voltage problem, empirical rules are used to generate appropriate control actions when slight voltage violations occur. Controls such as shunt capacitors, transformer tap changers and generator voltages are utilized. Theoretical justification of the empirical rules is presented. When it is judged that the voltage problem is so severe that empirical judgements may not be reliable, the developed expert system can help in formulating the problem so that an available application software package can be effectively utilized. In this paper, production rules are proposed to perform the above functions. Numerical examples are also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4334943/04334981.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334943","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Expert System Assisting Decision-Making of Reactive Power/Voltage Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Expert systems","Decision making","Reactive power control","Voltage control","Power system planning","Power system security","Power system analysis computing","Power system restoration","Power system interconnection","Application software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1986","displayDocTitle":"An Expert System Assisting Decision-Making of Reactive Power/Voltage Control","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Expert System Assisting Decision-Making of Reactive Power/Voltage Control","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v1-n3-38.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052602S","chronDate":"Aug.  1986","isNumber":"4334943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"125","articleId":"4334981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4334992,"authors":[{"name":"Marija Ilic-Spong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Marija","lastName":"Ilic-Spong","id":"38270573700"},{"name":"Arun Phadke","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Phadke","id":"37281782000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"4334992","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":449},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Power system transients","Power system planning","Current distribution","Power system analysis computing","Load flow","Steady-state","Voltage control","Control systems","Equations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4334992","abstract":"During recent years, problems associated with reactive power flow and bus voltages have acquired greater importance. The transmission capacity may sometimes be limited by reactive power considerations. In a few instances collapse of transmission network has been attributed to abnormal reactive power flow patterns. Some recent papers have addressed the question of improving the contingency study techniques for the reactive power flow problem. A commonly used method for contingency analysis is based upon the use of distribution factors. The distribution factor method of contingency analysis is very fast in its execution time, and for this reason is widely used in real time applications as well as planning studies. This technique is known to be particularly suited to the study of real power redistribution following an outage. It is not as accurate in dealing with problems of reactive power flow redistribution and accompanying effects on bus voltages. The inaccuracies are particularly significant when voltage controlled buses are present in the power system. The distribution factors are based on approximating active power injections by current injections under the assumption that voltage magnitudes throughout the system are kept constant. This is an unacceptable assumption for reactive power. This paper develops a new formulation of distribution factors which is suitable for the analysis of the reactive power problem. The new formulation is based on the S-E (complex power - complex bus voltage) representation of a power network instead of the usual I-E (complex current - complex bus voltage) formulation.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334992","startPage":"266","endPage":"274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1986.4334992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4334943","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4334943/04334992.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redistribution of Reactive Power Flow in Contingency Studies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4334992/","displayDocTitle":"Redistribution of Reactive Power Flow in Contingency Studies","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redistribution of Reactive Power Flow in Contingency Studies","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v1-n3-49.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037702S","chronDate":"Aug.  1986","isNumber":"4334943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4334992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4335006,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposed centralized control strategy resuls in structural action on demand/generation and is based on fast and decentralized detection and estimation of the power imbalance in the areas of an interconnected power system. Low order dynamic observers are proposed to estimate the magnitude of the imbalance using locally available measurements of frequency and tie-line power flows. Guidelines for the design of the proposed observer are presented and illustrated on the practically important example of an interconnected power system model.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1987.4335077","startPage":"78","endPage":"84","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4335059/04335077.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1987.4335077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Mismatch Detection and Estimation for Emergency Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system interconnection","Power system control","Power system modeling","Power system dynamics","Power systems","Power generation","Power system measurements","Frequency estimation","Control systems","Character generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Power Mismatch Detection and Estimation for Emergency Control","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Mismatch Detection and Estimation for Emergency Control","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v2-n1-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043122S","chronDate":"Feb.  1987","isNumber":"4335059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4335077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4335084,"authors":[{"name":"William V.

The model is based on a State Space formulation specially tailored for this application. A detailed correlation study is performed to identify the most relevant weather variables. Different models are used for Summer and Winter, since different weather variables are found to be relevant in both seasons. Adaptivity is attained through careful usage of Kalman filtering and Bayesian techniques. An appropriate methodology is developed to identify and correct anomalous load data and to model nonconforming loads. A new technique is introduced for \"filling in\" weather forecasts. The model has been sucessfully implemented using state-of-the-art data-base and man-machine techniques. Implementation results are reported. This model benefits from the experience gained using a variety of tools and represents important enhancements over existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1987.4335174","startPage":"592","endPage":"598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4335158/04335174.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1987.4335174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Weather-Sensitive Short Term Load Forecast","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Weather forecasting","Power system modeling","State-space methods","Kalman filters","Filtering","Bayesian methods","Load modeling","Filling","Man machine systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Weather-Sensitive Short Term Load Forecast","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Weather-Sensitive Short Term Load Forecast","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v2-n3-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033891S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"4335158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4335174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4335178,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur I.

The method uses a Lagrangian decomposition and successive approximation technique for solving the unit commitment problem where the generation, reserve and fuel constraints are adjoined onto the cost function using Lagrange multipliers. All important operating constraints have been incorporated including minimum up and down times, standby operation, ramping limits, time-dependent start-up cost, spinning and supplemental reserve.

This paper presents an alternative approach for power system stabilization based upon the tuning of the existing generator controllers, both governors and A.V.R.'s. The sensitivities of the eigenvalues to the controller parameters are evaluated and an optimization technique is developed to maximize the dynamic stability. Application of the parameter optimization method on a realistic model of the Hellenic Interconnected System has proved an efficient way to stabilize a number of unstable oscillatory modes by relatively small parameter variations. The results are tested with a nonlinear simulation program and the achieved stabilization, as shown by the rotor angle swings, is found to be significant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power System Stabilization via Parameter Optimization - Application to the Hellenic Interconnected System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Stabilization via Parameter Optimization - Application to the Hellenic Interconnected System","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v2-n3-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037615S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"4335158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"47","articleId":"4335180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4335199,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This is one of the functions being implemented as part of the Athens Automation and Control Experiment on the Athens Utilities Board (AUB) in Athens, Tennessee. A concern with automated capacitor switching is the increase in harmonic and transient voltages due to different capacitor configurations on the distribution system. A study was performed to evaluate the impact of the automated capacitor switching on the AUB distribution system. The study has identified problem areas, methods for determining the problem areas, and possible solutions. The substation capacitor banks were found to be the dominant factor in both the transient and harmonic repsonses of the distribution system. The harmonic response of the system is dominated by the parallel inductance/capacitance of the circuit comprised of the substation capacitor and equivalent source reactance at the substation. The transient analyses indicated that when the substation capacitor is energized, magnified transient voltages can occur at switched-in feeder capacitors. An evaluation of the effect of automated capacitor switching is necessary to properly design the automated capacitor switching schemes and the required arrester protection for any harmonic and/or transient overvoltage contingency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4335158/04335199.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.1987.4335199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.1987.4335199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335158","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4335199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient and Harmonic Voltages Associated with Automated Capacitor Switching on Distribution Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substations","Automation","Switched capacitor circuits","Transient analysis","Switching circuits","Automatic voltage control","Control systems","Reactive power","Automatic control","Performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Transient and Harmonic Voltages Associated with Automated Capacitor Switching on Distribution Systems","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient and Harmonic Voltages Associated with Automated Capacitor Switching on Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"TPWRS-v2-n3-41.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028408S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"4335158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4335199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4335210,"authors":[{"name":"Martin T.

A new control concept for Static VAr Compensators based on using modal speeds as feedback signals, is presented. The concept enables a static VAr compensator to damp all the oscillatory modes as well as controlling the system voltage. A comparison is made between the cases where either modal speeds or generator speed deviations are used as the stabilizing signals of static VAr compensators. The present study shows that coordination of static compensators and power system stabilizers can significantly increase power system dampings as compared with cases where either static VAr compensators or power system stabilizers are used to damp system oscillations. This study is performed on System-1 of the second IEEE benchmark for SSR studies, using an eigenvalue method.

Thus, there is no provision for system degradation with time. Operation of many systems causes stress which results in system degradation and hence an increase in the level of the hazard function with time. PM is assumed to relieve stress temporarily and hence slow the rate of system degradation. However, this type of activity does not reverse degradation; so the hazard function is monotone. A hazard function is developed in this paper consistent with this concept of PM effect. The special case for which PM reduces the operational stress to that of a new system is considered in greater detail (eg, a new system begins operation with the full benefit of a PM activity; each subsequent PM completely restores the benefits). It is shown for this case that the hazard function under PM is approximately a 2-parameter Weibull with shape parameter 2 for systems with strictly increasing hazard without PM. Cost optimization of the PM intervention interval is obtained by determining the average cost-rate of system operation. When the hazard function without PM is unknown, optimization may be achieved through an iterative process. This avoids the necessity of estimating system failure characteristics without PM; such testing can be destructive or use expensive equipment.","doi":"10.1109/TR.1986.4335355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/4335320/04335355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1986.4335355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335320","startPage":"78","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Optimization of Periodic Preventive Maintenance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4335355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cost Optimization of Periodic Preventive Maintenance","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"April 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost Optimization of Periodic Preventive Maintenance","sourcePdf":"TR-v35-n1-35.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029357S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"4335320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"134","articleId":"4335355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4335390,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The problem treated is that of true frequency modulation of an oscillator, a process which, except for a few special cases, generates waveforms and spectra different from those produced by sequentially switching between the outputs of two continuously running oscillators. The final expression for the power spectrum is simple and written in closed form. The power spectrum of PCM/FM is dependent on the bit rate fB, usually defined as the reciprocal of T, and the deviation ratio D, defined as the difference between the two possible values of the instantaneous frequency divided by the bit rate. For small values of D(D<.5) the spectrum of PCM/FM has a shape resembling a high-Q resonance curve with a 3-db bandwidth given by \u00bd\u03c0 fBD2. As D increases, fB being fixed, the resonance curve becomes a poorer approximation, and with D in the vicinity of 0.7 the spectral density is nearly flat across a frequency band equal to the bit rate and drops abruptly on either side of this frequency band. It is interesting to note that a value of D near 0.7 has been found to yield minimum probability of error for given received power and receiver noise temperature. As D increases from 0.7 to 1.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Phase change materials","Frequency modulation","Frequency shift keying","Bit rate","Pulse modulation","Oscillators","Resonance","Random sequences","Power generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4335590","doi":"10.1109/TSET.1964.4335590","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/4335581/4335582/04335590.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSET.1964.4335590","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Autocorrelation Function and Power Spectrum of PCM/FM with Random Binary Modulating Waveforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Autocorrelation Function and Power Spectrum of PCM/FM with Random Binary Modulating Waveforms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1964","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"March 1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Autocorrelation Function and Power Spectrum of PCM/FM with Random Binary Modulating Waveforms","sourcePdf":"TSET1-v10-n1-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058731S","chronDate":"March  1964","isNumber":"4335582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"32","articleId":"4335590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4335601,"authors":[{"name":"A.

S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D. C., for the detection of earth satellites forms a fence across the southern part of the United States. Four receiving sites are alternated with three transmitting sites which illuminate satellites with radio energy as they traverse the fence. The angle of arrival of the reflected energy is measured at each receiving station by a compound radio interferometer. These signals yield a multiplicity of channels which are normally recorded on paper, read and resolved by using slide rules and/or mathematical tables. Operationally the resolution is done by a computer. With the increasing satellite population the number of fence crossings has increased considerably. Automation in the detection process is needed to facilitate identification and sorting of satellites from each other if a large backlog of data is to be avoided. The purpose of this report is to describe an electronic system which automatically combines several noisy ambiguous radio interferometer phase channels into one unambiguous quiet channel. This technique results in that given a multi-baseline radio interferometer system, normally having high angular resolution capability accompanied with the usual interferometer ambiguity problem associated with deciphering the multiple phase signal outputs it can be instrumented directly into a single unambiguous signal output which has an accuracy and resolution proportional to the longest baseline in the interferometer and whose noise content is inversely proportional to this baseline.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/4335581/4335596/04335604.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSET.1964.4335604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSET.1964.4335604","startPage":"116","endPage":"123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Interferometer Phase-Channel Combiner Mod.

Inspired by recent advancements in image inpainting techniques, we propose an image compression framework towards visual quality rather than pixel-wise fidelity. In this framework, an original image is analyzed at the encoder side so that portions of the image are intentionally and automatically skipped. Instead, some information is extracted from these skipped regions and delivered to the decoder as assistant information in the compressed fashion. The delivered assistant information plays a key role in the proposed framework because it guides image inpainting to accurately restore these regions at the decoder side. Moreover, to fully take advantage of the assistant information, a compression-oriented edge-based inpainting algorithm is proposed for image restoration, integrating pixel-wise structure propagation and patch-wise texture synthesis. We also construct a practical system to verify the effectiveness of the compression approach in which edge map serves as assistant information and the edge extraction and region removal approaches are developed accordingly. Evaluations have been made in comparison with baseline JPEG and standard MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 intra-picture coding. Experimental results show that our system achieves up to 44% and 33% bits-savings, respectively, at similar visual quality levels. Our proposed framework is a promising exploration towards future image and video compression.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4318237/04335633.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318237","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Compression With Edge-Based Inpainting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4335633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image Compression With Edge-Based Inpainting","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624830","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4335633/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Compression With Edge-Based Inpainting","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt10-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098489S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4318237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4318237","articleId":"4335633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":4335637,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Ching Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Ching","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292902200"},{"name":"Jhing-Fa Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhing-Fa","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280532500"},{"name":"Jar-Ferr Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jar-Ferr","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280193800"},{"name":"Jang-Ting Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jang-Ting","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716532200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4335637","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1051},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Algorithm design and analysis","Automatic voltage control","PSNR","Video coding","Degradation","Computer architecture","Filtering","CMOS technology","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","feature extraction","filtering theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast mode decision algorithm","VLSI design","H.264/AVC intra-prediction","spatial domain filtering technique","dominant edge strength","signal-to-noise ratio","PSNR","finite-state machine","memory allocation","pseudoblock computation","edge filtering","dominant edge strength extraction","CMOS single-poly-six-metal technology","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced video coding (AVC)","dominant edge extraction","H264","intra-mode decision","intra-prediction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a fast mode decision algorithm and design its VLSI architecture for H.264 intra-prediction.

In the case of the HM 6508-RH RAMs, measured values of critical charge of 1 pC and 2 pC at 5V and 7V, respectively, indicate that the devices can be expected to 4show bit-error rates in space of approximately 1 \u00d7 10-4 per chip per day at 5V bias and 1 \u00d7 10-5 per chip per day at 7V bias.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Error Susceptibility of CMOS RAMS: Dependence upon Power Supply Voltage","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1981.4335665","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4335641/04335665.pdf","startPage":"4013","endPage":"4016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1981.4335665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4335665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Soft Error Susceptibility of CMOS RAMS: Dependence upon Power Supply Voltage","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Error Susceptibility of CMOS RAMS: Dependence upon Power Supply Voltage","sourcePdf":"TNS-v28-n6-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026494S","chronDate":"Dec.  1981","isNumber":"4335641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4335665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4335683,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Calculations determined how the damage energy is partitioned into free defects and cascades by fast collisions.

Channeling experiments were then performed on <111> single crystal silicon implanted with 1.0 MeV 20Ne, 0.5 MeV 4He and 75 keV 1H. Energies and fluences of the ions were matched such that over the first 0.3\u03bcm the damage energy deposited and the rate of energy deposition were the same for all species. The experimental data were analyzed assuming that equivalent primary damage states will evolve into statistically equivalent final damage states at high fluences.

An alternating bias (between \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states) applied to the gate during irradiation need not give threshold voltage shifts intermediate between those for the two DC bias conditions.

The technique employs one photomultiplier per two BGO crystals in a scheme of alternating single PMT/crystal and shared PMT/crystal combinations to form a pseudo-continuous ring. Problems of crosstalk between detectors, nonuniform sensitivities and variable resolution are shown to be minimized once discriminator thresholds are clearly above the energy of the bismuth x-rays induced in the BGO crystals by the 511 keV gammas from the positron annihilations. A stationary circular system employing 4.5 mm wide BGO detectors can provide transverse sampling equal to 1/2 the center to center crystal distance or 2.5 mm sampling. The measured intrinsic resolution of a bench top version of this system is 5 to 6 mm FWHH for a 30cm diameter field of view for a 100 cm system diameter. The 2.5 mm sampling with reconstruction filter of appropriate frequency response should provide a high resolution image on the order of 7 to 8 mm FWHM with good signal to noise characteristics which is free of significant aliasing artifacts.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1982.4335885","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4335780/04335885.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1982.4335885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"452","endPage":"456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of a Technique for Providing a Pseudo-Continuous Detector Ring for Positron Tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4335885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of a Technique for Providing a Pseudo-Continuous Detector Ring for Positron Tomography","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335885/","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of a Technique for Providing a Pseudo-Continuous Detector Ring for Positron Tomography","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n1-105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031839S","chronDate":"Feb.  1982","isNumber":"4335780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4335885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4335887,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In order to overcome this deficiency, most multi-slice tomographs use the nearest neighbor coincidence lines and approximate the position of the slice by summing the two sets of lines. This still leaves a fair number of coincidence lines which are discarded. TOFPET, with its ability to localize the positions of the annihilation, overcomes this limitation with a new technique of utilizing all the inter-slice coincidence lines. Each coincidence event is localized in three dimensions and then placed in one of the imaae slices for tomographic reconstruction. With a proper design of the positron camera, this can result in a sensitivity increase of 60% over cameras of similar design but utilizing only the nearest neighbor inter-slice coincidences. We show how this new technique is implemented in the TOFPET camera being constructed at our institution.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1982.4335891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1982.4335891","startPage":"479","endPage":"483","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4335780/04335891.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Improvement of TOFPET by the Utilization of the Inter-Slice Coincidences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Improvement of TOFPET by the Utilization of the Inter-Slice Coincidences","publicationDate":"Feb. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335891/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Improvement of TOFPET by the Utilization of the Inter-Slice Coincidences","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n1-111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058214S","chronDate":"Feb.  1982","isNumber":"4335780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4335891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4335896,"authors":[{"name":"John W.

Correction procedures can be evaluated by comparing corrected images with images absent of scatter and attenuation. The simulation enables control of components which govern the emission and transport of radiation through the source and attenuating medium. The basic calculation involves sampling the probability density functions (pdf) which govern the photon transport process. First, the origin of a photon is selected by sampling. Variance reduction is applied so that a detection is \"forced\" and weighted by the probability of an initial direction within the acceptance angle of the collimator multiplied by the probability that the photon is not attenuated. Second, the photon history is continued by sampling for a direction. The photon is forced to interact within the attenuating medium and an appropriate weight is calculated. Variance reduction is again applied with a weight determined by the product of the probability of interaction within the attenuating medium, the probability of scatter, the probability of scattering into the acceptance angle of the collimator, and the probability that the photon reaches the detector. Finally, a new direction and energy is selected. If the new energy is below the baseline energy, the history is terminated; otherwise, the second step is repeated. Presently, the collimator's geometric efficiency is considered without septal penetration.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Monte Carlo methods","Single photon emission computed tomography","Electromagnetic scattering","Particle scattering","Sampling methods","Optical collimators","History","Image analysis","Computational modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.1982.4335896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4335780/04335896.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4335780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1982.4335896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of SPECT including Scatter and Attenuation Using Sophisticated Monte Carlo Modeling Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4335896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of SPECT including Scatter and Attenuation Using Sophisticated Monte Carlo Modeling Methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4335896/","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of SPECT including Scatter and Attenuation Using Sophisticated Monte Carlo Modeling Methods","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n1-116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029807S","chronDate":"Feb.  1982","isNumber":"4335780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"115","articleId":"4335896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4335900,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Focusing on energy efficiency, a noncooperative game is proposed in which users in the network are allowed to choose their transmit powers to maximize their own utilities, and the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that, due to the frequency selective multipath, the noncooperative solution is achieved at different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, depending on the channel realization and the type of Rake receiver employed. A large-system analysis is performed to derive explicit expressions for the achieved utilities.

The systems are considered in multipath fading channels, the IEEE 802.15.3a channel standard, with four channel models: CM1, CM2, CM3, and CM4. These channel models are characterized by cluster arrival rate, ray arrival rate within clusters, and cluster and ray decay factors. First, an average signal-to-noise ratio with imperfect synchronizations and intersymbol interference is derived. Then a closed-form bit error rate performance formulation that provides insightful understanding of the system performance in various synchronization conditions is obtained under Rayleigh fading assumption. This analytical performance formulation serves as an upper bound on the bit error rate performance of UWB systems. Finally, simulation results under various channel and synchronization conditions are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","OFDM","Intersymbol interference","Frequency synchronization","Bit error rate","Ultra wideband technology","Timing","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","synchronisation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading channel","synchronization conditions","signal-to-noise ratio","ultra-wideband channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiband OFDM UWB system","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-error rate","carrier-frequency offset","frequency synchronization","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","MB-OFDM","multipath fading channel","timing synchronization","ultra-wideband (UWB)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336103","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4336090/04336103.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906650","startPage":"521","endPage":"534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multiband OFDM UWB Systems With Imperfect Synchronization and Intersymbol Interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multiband OFDM UWB Systems With Imperfect Synchronization and Intersymbol Interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336103/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4336103/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748091","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Multiband OFDM UWB Systems With Imperfect Synchronization and Intersymbol Interference","sourcePdf":"01jstsp03-lai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052773S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4336090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4336090","articleId":"4336103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4336104,"authors":[{"name":"Preeti Nagvanshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Preeti","lastName":"Nagvanshi","id":"37662200500"},{"name":"Elias Masry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Masry","id":"37294022900"},{"name":"Laurence B.

The proposed approach relies on the fact that transmitting an ultra-short pulse through a multipath UWB channel leads to a received UWB signal that can be approximated by a linear combination of a few atoms from a pre-defined dictionary, yielding thus a sparse representation of the received UWB signal. The key in the proposed approach is in the design of a dictionary of parameterized waveforms (atoms) that closely matches the information-carrying pulseshape leading thus to higher energy compaction and sparse representation, and, therefore higher probability for CS reconstruction. Two approaches for UWB channel estimation are developed under a data-aided framework. In the first approach, the CS reconstruction capabilities are exploited to recover the composite pulse-multipath channel from a reduced set of random projections. This reconstructed signal is subsequently used as a referent template in a correlator-based detector. In the second approach, from a set of random projections of the received pilot signal, the Matching Pursuit algorithm is used to identify the strongest atoms in the projected signal that, in turn, are related to the strongest propagation paths that composite the multipath UWB channel. A Rake like receiver uses those atoms as templates for the bank of correlators in the detection stage. The bit error rate performances of the proposed approaches are analyzed and compared to that of traditional correlator-based detector. Extensive simulations show that for different propagation scenarios and UWB communication channels, detectors based on CS channel estimation outperform traditional correlator using just 1/3 of the sampling rate leading thus to a reduced use of analog-to-digital resources in the channel estimation stage.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4336090/04336106.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Wideband Compressed Sensing: Channel Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Compressed sensing","Channel estimation","Detectors","Dictionaries","Signal processing","Matching pursuit algorithms","Correlators","Linear approximation","Compaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlators","error statistics","multipath channels","radio receivers","signal detection","signal reconstruction","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-wideband compressed sensing","UWB channel estimation","pulse multipath UWB channel","parameterized waveforms","data-aided framework","random projections","signal reconstruction","correlator-based detector","Matching Pursuit algorithm","Rake like receiver","bit error rate","sampling rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","compressive sensing","detection","ultra-wideband"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Wideband Compressed Sensing: Channel Estimation","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4336106/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748093","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Wideband Compressed Sensing: Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"01jstsp03-paredes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066397S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4336090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"4336090","articleId":"4336106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4336109,"authors":[{"name":"Vasanthan Raghavan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4336090/4336109/4336109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vasanthan Raghavan (S'01-M'06) received the B.

Motivated by recent measurement results on UWB channels, we propose a model for sparse multipath channels. A key implication of sparsity is that the independent degrees of freedom in the channel scale sublinearly with the signal space dimension (product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the number of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a training and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal short-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates sparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time and frequency. We study the impact of multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the wideband/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality conditions. Recent results by Zheng et al. have underscored the large gap in spectral efficiency between coherent and noncoherent extremes and the importance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results, our results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: (1) the coherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby significantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; (2) sparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent - for a given but large bandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements for first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling duration; and (3) the requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is eliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4336090/04336109.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of Sparse Multipath Channels in the Ultra-Wideband Regime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336109/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of Sparse Multipath Channels in the Ultra-Wideband Regime","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748096","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4336109/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of Sparse Multipath Channels in the Ultra-Wideband Regime","sourcePdf":"01jstsp03-raghavan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102921S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4336090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4336090","articleId":"4336109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4336110,"authors":[{"name":"Hongsan Sheng","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications Limited Liability Company, King of Prussia, PA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4336090/4336110/4336110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongsan Sheng (M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1992 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, in 2005, all in electrical engineering.","He is a Staff Engineer in Air Interface and RF Systems with InterDigital Communications, LLC., King of Prussia, PA.

The performance of a UWB system employing a Rake receiver and maximum ratio combining is analyzed taking into account estimation errors as predicted by the CRB.

Our analytical results well match computer simulations and can readily be applied to evaluate and improve the performance of UWB systems over realistic channel and interference models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","volume":"1","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9748099","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4336112/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio Analysis for Direct-Sequence Ultra-Wideband Systems in Generalized Saleh\u2013Valenzuela Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio Analysis for Direct-Sequence Ultra-Wideband Systems in Generalized Saleh\u2013Valenzuela Channels","sourcePdf":"01jstsp03-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092012S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4336090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4336090","articleId":"4336112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4336115,"authors":[{"name":"Will Barker","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/4336114/4336115/4336115-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Will Barker received the Degree in mechatronics (Hons.) from the University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K., in 1997.

While many of the processes used by nature to achieve fault tolerance cannot easily be applied to silicon-based systems, in this paper we show that mechanisms loosely inspired by the operation of multicellular organisms can be transported to electronic systems to provide self-repair capabilities. Features such as dynamic routing, reconfiguration, and on-chip reprogramming can be invaluable for the realization of adaptive hardware systems and for the design of highly complex systems based on the kind of unreliable components that are likely to be introduced in the not-too-distant future. In this paper, we describe the implementation of fault tolerant features that address error detection and recovery through dynamic routing, reconfiguration, and on-chip reprogramming in a novel application specific integrated circuit. We take inspiration from three biological models: \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">phylogenesis, ontogenesis,</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">epigenesis</i>\n (hence the POE in POEtic).

On the one hand, we provide an overview of previous ant-based approaches to the classification task and compare them with state-of-the-art classification techniques, such as C4.5, RIPPER, and support vector machines in a benchmark study. On the other hand, a new ant-based classification technique is proposed, named AntMiner+. The key differences between the proposed AntMiner+ and previous AntMiner versions are the usage of the better performing MAX-MIN ant system, a clearly defined and augmented environment for the ants to walk through, with the inclusion of the class variable to handle multiclass problems, and the ability to include interval rules in the rule list. Furthermore, the commonly encountered problem in ACO of setting system parameters is dealt with in an automated, dynamic manner. Our benchmarking experiments show an AntMiner+ accuracy that is superior to that obtained by the other AntMiner versions, and competitive or better than the results achieved by the compared classification techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2006.890229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4336114/04336122.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2006.890229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336114","startPage":"651","endPage":"665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification With Ant Colony Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Classification With Ant Colony Optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633626","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4336122/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification With Ant Colony Optimization","sourcePdf":"11tevc05-martens.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118734S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4336114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"285","xplore-issue":"4336114","articleId":"4336122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4336123,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Mattiussi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, Institute of Systems Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/4336114/4336123/4336123-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Claudio Mattiussi is a Research Scientist with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, where he conducts work on evolutionary computation, neural networks, and machine learning.

The representation is aimed at the evolutionary synthesis and reverse engineering of circuits and networks such as analog electronic circuits, neural networks, and genetic regulatory networks. AGE permits the simultaneous evolution of the topology and sizing of the networks. The establishment of the links between the devices that form the network is based on an implicit definition of the interaction between different parts of the genome. This reduces the amount of information that must be carried by the genome, relatively to a direct encoding of the links. The application of AGE is illustrated with examples of analog electronic circuit and neural network synthesis. The performance of the representation and the quality of the results obtained with AGE are compared with those produced by genetic programming.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2006.886801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4336114/04336123.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2006.886801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336114","startPage":"596","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Genetic Encoding for the Evolution of Circuits and Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analog Genetic Encoding for the Evolution of Circuits and Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633627","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4336123/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Genetic Encoding for the Evolution of Circuits and Networks","sourcePdf":"11tevc05-mattiussi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083308S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4336114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4336114","articleId":"4336123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4336129,"authors":[{"name":"Yuping Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/4336114/4336129/4336129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuping Wang received the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree in computational mathematics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, in 1993.","He is a Full Professor at Xidian University.

An application of Latin squares leads to a new and effective crossover operator. This crossover operator can generate a set of uniformly scattered offspring around their parents, has the ability to search locally, and can explore the search space efficiently. To compute a globally optimal solution, the level set of the objective function is successively evolved by crossover and mutation operators so that it gradually approaches the globally optimal solution set. As a result, the level set can be efficiently improved. Based on these skills, a new EA is developed to solve a global optimization problem by successively evolving the level set of the objective function such that it becomes smaller and smaller until all of its points are optimal solutions. Furthermore, we can prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a global optimizer with probability one. Numerical simulations are conducted for 20 standard test functions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of eight EAs that have been published recently and the Monte Carlo implementation of the mean-value-level-set method. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2006.886802","startPage":"579","endPage":"595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2006.886802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336114","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4336114/04336129.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolutionary Algorithm for Global Optimization Based on Level-Set Evolution and Latin Squares","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336129/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Algorithm for Global Optimization Based on Level-Set Evolution and Latin Squares","volume":"11","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4336129/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9633629","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evolutionary Algorithm for Global Optimization Based on Level-Set Evolution and Latin Squares","sourcePdf":"11tevc05-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127639S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4336114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4336114","articleId":"4336129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4336132,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Lin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan","National Nano Device Laboratories, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279193600"},{"name":"Sheng-Fuh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Fuh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37539730600"},{"name":"Guo-Wei Huang","affiliation":["National Nano Device Laboratories, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guo-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37274327500"},{"name":"Yuh-Sheng Jean","affiliation":["Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuh-Sheng","lastName":"Jean","id":"37357731500"},{"name":"Ta-Hsun Yeh","affiliation":["Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ta-Hsun","lastName":"Yeh","id":"38183026700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4336132","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1069},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Low-noise amplifiers","Topology","Gain control","Energy consumption","FETs","Power measurement","Gain measurement","Noise measurement","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","interference","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["size 0.13 mum","noise figure 4.2 dB","frequency 15 GHz","gain 10.8 dB","gain 23.3 dB","voltage 0.2 V to 1.2 V","current 4 mA","voltage 1.3 V","Ku-band CMOS","interference rejection","low-noise amplifier","current-reused stacked common-gate topology","wide gain control range","low dc power consumption","common-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors","interstage parallel tank"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","common-gate amplifier","interference- rejection (IR)","low-noise amplifier (LNA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336132","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2007.905631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2007.905631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4336131/04336132.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ku-Band Interference-Rejection CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier Using Current-Reused Stacked Common-Gate Topology","abstract":"A Ku-band CMOS low-noise amplifier (LNA) with high interference-rejection (IR), wide gain control range, and low dc power consumption is presented.

The corresponding figures of merit at 100 kHz and 1 MHz offset are 190.3 and 192.6 dBc/Hz/mW, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2007.905636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4336131/04336144.pdf","startPage":"730","endPage":"732","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2007.905636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5 GHz, 192.6 dBc/Hz/mW FOM, LC\u2013VCO System With Amplitude Control Loop and LDO Voltage Regulator in 0.18 -m CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A 5 GHz, 192.6 dBc/Hz/mW FOM, LC\u2013VCO System With Amplitude Control Loop and LDO Voltage Regulator in 0.18 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu$</tex></formula>m CMOS","volume":"17","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4336144/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633615","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5 GHz, 192.6 dBc/Hz/mW FOM, LC\u2013VCO System With Amplitude Control Loop and LDO Voltage Regulator in 0.18 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu$</tex></formula>m CMOS","sourcePdf":"17lmwc10-lin3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053199S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4336131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4336131","articleId":"4336144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4336148,"authors":[{"name":"Yuna Shim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yuna","lastName":"Shim","id":"37714779700"},{"name":"Chang-Wan Kim","affiliation":["Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea","Department of Electronic Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang-Wan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279784600"},{"name":"Jeongseon Lee","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongseon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37578638300"},{"name":"Sang-Gug Lee","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Gug","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281132200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4336148","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2216},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336148","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Frequency","Topology","CMOS technology","Ultra wideband technology","Broadband amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Impedance matching","Noise figure","Circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","ultra wideband technology","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full band UWB common-gate LNA","cascode","ultra wideband low noise amplifier topology","noise figure","CMOS","gain","frequency 3.1 GHz to 10.5 GHz","size 0.18 mum","gain 10 dB","gain 16 dB","gain 3.8 dB to 4 dB","current 5.3 mA","voltage 1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-gate","low noise amplifier (LNA)","ultra wideband (UWB)"]}],"abstract":"A two-stage, common-gate in cascade with cascode, ultra wideband low noise amplifier (LNA) topology is proposed for 3.1 to 10.5 GHz full band application.

Features representing different visual cues were combined in a supervised learning framework. We compared the performance of Gaussian, -nearest neighbor, and support vector machine classifiers together with the sequential forward feature selection algorithm. On diagnosis, using a five-fold cross-validation estimate, an accuracy of 96.7% was obtained.

To retain the excellent energy efficiency while reducing performance loss, we propose to investigate near subthreshold techniques on chip multiprocessors (CMP). We show that logic and memory cells have different optimal supply and threshold voltages, therefore we propose to allow the cores and memory to operate in different voltage regions. With the memory operating at a different voltage, we then explore the design space in which several slower cores clustered together share a faster LI cache. We show that an architecture such as this is optimal for energy efficiency. In particular, SPLASH2 benchmarks show a 53% energy reduction over the conventional CMP approach (70% energy reduction over a single core machine). In addition we explore the design trade-offs that occur if we have a separate instruction and data cache. We show that some applications prefer the data cache to be clustered while the instruction cache is kept private to the core allowing further energy savings of a 77% reduction over a single core machine.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2007.4336210","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4336183/4336184/04336210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2007.4336210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336184","startPage":"175","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy Efficient Parallel Architecture Using Near Threshold Operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Efficient Parallel Architecture Using Near Threshold Operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336210/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9877057","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4336210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy Efficient Parallel Architecture Using Near Threshold Operation","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"29440175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06675S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4336183","isNumber":"4336184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4336183","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4336184","articleId":"4336210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4336211,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Inoue","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37292993100"},{"name":"Takao Moriyama","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Japan"],"firstName":"Takao","lastName":"Moriyama","id":"37402945200"},{"name":"Hideaki Komatsu","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideaki","lastName":"Komatsu","id":"37267393300"},{"name":"Toshio Nakatani","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37266760500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2944-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2944-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"4336211","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":620},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Scalability","Yarn","Libraries","Acceleration","Parallel processing","Pipelines","Computational complexity","Laboratories","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel processing","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel sorting algorithm","aligned-access sort","shared-memory multiprocessors","SIMD instructions","PowerPC 970MP","Cell Broadband Engine","GPUTeraSort"]}],"abstract":"Many sorting algorithms have been studied in the past, but there are only a few algorithms that can effectively exploit both SIMD instructions and thread-level parallelism.

All these cores inherently share the DRAM bandwidth. The on-chip cache resources are limited and in many situations, cannot hold the working set of the threads running on all these cores. This situation makes DRAM bandwidth a critical shared resource. Existing DRAM bandwidth management schemes provide support for enforcing bandwidth shares but have problems like starvation, complexity, and unpredictable DRAM access latency. In this paper, we propose a DRAM bandwidth management scheme with two key features. First, the scheme avoids unexpected long latencies or starvation of memory requests. It also allows OS to select the right combination of performance and strength of bandwidth share enforcement. Second, it provides a feedback-driven policy that adoptively tunes the bandwidth shares to achieve desired average latencies for memory accesses. This feature is useful under high contention and can be used to provide performance level support for critical applications or to support service level agreements for enterprise computing data centers.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2007.4336216","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4336183/4336184/04336216.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2007.4336216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Management of DRAM Bandwidth in Multicore Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effective Management of DRAM Bandwidth in Multicore Processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336216/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9877063","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4336216/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Management of DRAM Bandwidth in Multicore Processors","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"29440245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101351S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4336183","isNumber":"4336184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4336183","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4336184","articleId":"4336216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4336219,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewook Shin","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jaewook","lastName":"Shin","id":"37417887800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2944-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2944-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"4336219","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":185},"abstract":"Single instruction multiple data (SIMD) functional units are ubiquitous in modern microprocessors. Effective use of these SIMD functional units is essential in achieving the highest possible performance. Automatic generation of SIMD instructions in the presence of control flow is challenging, however, not only because SIMD code is hard to generate in the presence of arbitrarily complex control flow, but also because the SIMD code executing the instructions in all control paths may slow compared to the scalar original, which may bypass a large portion of the code. One promising technique introduced recently involves inserting branches-on-superword-condition-codes (BOSCCs) to bypass vector instructions. In this paper, we describe two techniques that improve on the previous approach. First, BOSCCs are generated in a nested fashion so that even BOSCCs themselves can be bypassed by other BOSCCs. Second, we generate all vec_any_* instructions to bypass even some predicate-defining instructions. We implemented these techniques in a vectorizing compiler. On 14 kernels, the compiler achieves distinct speedups, including 1.99X over the previous technique that generates single- level BOSCCs and vec_any_ne only.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Automatic generation control","Microprocessors","Automatic control","Kernel","Parallel architectures","Mathematics","Computer science","Laboratories","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","software performance evaluation","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control flow","vectorized code","single instruction multiple data","microprocessors","branches-on-superword-condition-codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336219","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2007.4336219","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4336183/4336184/04336219.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2007.4336219","startPage":"280","endPage":"291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336184","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2007)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing Control Flow into Vectorized Code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Introducing Control Flow into Vectorized Code","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336219/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4336219/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9877066","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing Control Flow into Vectorized Code","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"29440280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085846S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4336183","isNumber":"4336184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4336183","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4336184","articleId":"4336219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4336221,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Vera","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Vera","id":"37709554400"},{"name":"Francisco J.

In order to evaluate their behavior, several methodologies and metrics have been proposed. A methodology defines when the measurements of a given workload execution are taken. A metric combines those measurements to obtain a final evaluation result. However, since current evaluation methodologies do not provide representative measurements for these metrics, the analysis and evaluation of novel ideas could be either unfair or misleading. Given the potential impact of multithreaded architectures on current and future processor designs, it is crucial to develop an accurate evaluation methodology for them. This paper presents FAME, a new evaluation methodology aimed to fairly measure the performance of multithreaded processors. FAME re-executes all traces in a multithreaded workload until all of them are fairly represented in the final measurements taken from the workload. We compare FAME with previously used methodologies for both architectural research simulators and real processors. Our results show that FAME provides more accurate measurements than other methodologies, becoming an ideal evaluation methodology to analyze proposals for multithreaded architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4336221/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9877068","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FAME: FAirly MEasuring Multithreaded Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAME: FAirly MEasuring Multithreaded Architectures","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"29440305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05961S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4336183","isNumber":"4336184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4336183","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4336184","articleId":"4336221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4336222,"authors":[{"name":"John H.

However, due to the prohibitive simulation time of commercial workloads, it is extremely difficult to use them in computer architecture research. In this paper, we study the efficacy of using statistical sampling-based simulation methodology for two classes of commercial workloads: a Java server benchmark SPECjbb2000 and an online transaction processing (OLTP) benchmark DBT-2. Our results show that, although SPECjbb2000 shows distinct garbage collection phases, there are no large-scale phases in the OLTP benchmark. We take advantage of this stationary behavior in the steady phase and propose a statistical sampling-based simulation technique DynaSim with two dynamic stopping rules. In this approach, the simulation terminates once the target accuracy has been met. We apply DynaSim to simulate commercial workloads and show that, with the simulation of only a few million total instructions, the error can be within 3 percent, at a confidence level of 99 percent. DynaSim compares favorably with random sampling and representative sampling in terms of the total number of instructions simulated (time cost) and with representative sampling in terms of the number of checkpoints (storage cost). DynaSim increases the usability of a sampling-based simulation approach for commercial workloads and will encourage the use of commercial workloads in computer architecture research.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.70748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.70748","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1533","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4336291/04336300.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Statistical Sampling for Fast and Efficient Simulation of Commercial Workloads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Applying Statistical Sampling for Fast and Efficient Simulation of Commercial Workloads","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","volume":"56","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4336300/","accessionNumber":"9726514","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336300/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Statistical Sampling for Fast and Efficient Simulation of Commercial Workloads","sourcePdf":"t1520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093148S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4336291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4336291","articleId":"4336300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4336303,"authors":[{"name":"Ge Nong","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Nong","id":"37298440000"},{"name":"Sen Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics, College at Oneonta, State University of New York, Oneonta, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291014500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"4336303","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336303","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Sorting","Transforms","Complexity theory","Image coding","Mobile communication","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression","matrix algebra","sorting","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sort transform","Burrows-Wheeler transform","memory-efficient inverse ST algorithms","auxiliary vectors","time complexity","space complexity","doubling technique","data compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Burrows-Wheeler transform","inverse sort transform","limit-order contexts","algorithm design","data compression."]}],"abstract":"As an important variant of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), the Sort Transform (ST) can speed up the transformation by sorting only a portion of the matrix.

The second uses two additional compact \"alternate vectors\" to further eliminate the need to restore all of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-order contexts and achieve \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n) space complexity. Moreover, the third uses a \"doubling technique\" to further reduce the time complexity to \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n). The hallmark of these three algorithms is that they can invert the ST in a manner similar to inverting BWT in that they all make use of precalculated auxiliary mapping vectors and require no hash tables. These unifying algorithms can also better explain the connection between the BWT and the ST: Not only can their forward components be performed by the same algorithm framework, but their respective inverse components can also be efficiently conducted by the unifying algorithm framework proposed in the present work.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4336291/04336303.pdf","startPage":"1564","endPage":"1574","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.70762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.70762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for the Inverse Sort Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for the Inverse Sort Transform","htmlLink":"/document/4336303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9726517","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Algorithms for the Inverse Sort Transform","sourcePdf":"t1564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059753S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"4336291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4336303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4336332,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These structures have been thinned stepwise to 25 to 60 \u00c5 using a relatively benign wet-chemical depth-profiling procedure. An analytical method based on oxide/substrate intensity ratios is used to deduce the product of the atomic number density (D) and the electron mean free path (\u03bb) as a function of depth for these structures. Samples showing a wide variety of hole trapping efficiencies were examined. Si+3 species are formed in the region of the Si/SiO2 interface and are observed during the course of their relaxation and annihilation. These formation results are correlated with the presence of strained Si-O-Si bonds at the interfaces. Radiation hard and soft structures show different strained bond distributions in the interfacial region. The direct observation of bond cleavage and bond strain gradients in these samples is used to extend silica devitrification models to explain the generation of fixed oxide charge and interface states. This bond strain gradient (BSG) model is shown to be consistent with a variety of experimental EPR and electrical observations of hole- and electron-trap generation by ionizing radiation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4336371/04336387.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1982.4336387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1982.4336387","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation-Induced Defects in SiO2 as Determined with XPS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336387/","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-Induced Defects in SiO2 as Determined with XPS","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-Induced Defects in SiO2 as Determined with XPS","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056595S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"4336371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"187","articleId":"4336387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4336388,"authors":[{"name":"R.

When the probability distribution of radiation stress to failure is approximately lognormal, and a test shows that with confidence, C, the survival probability is at least PT at the test level of stress RT, then with the same confidence the survival probability is at least PS at a lower specification level of stress RS where, Ps = F[ F-(PT) + ln(RT/RS/+ln(MAX)] The standard deviation, 4336454ln(MAX), is the estimated maximum s.d. in the logarithms of stress to failure; the function, F(X), is the standard normal cumulative probability distribution function; and the function, F(P), is the antifunction of F(X) - that is, F(P) standard deviations above the mean of a normal distribution includes fraction P of the distribution. A discussion is given of how this formula also applies to those tests which are more properly acceptance/rejection tests rather than tests which establish a confidence that parts will survive a given radiation level with a given probability. The suggested overtesting technique is compared to other standard testing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1982.4336454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4336371/04336454.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1982.4336454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1821","endPage":"1826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardness Assurance and Overtesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Hardness Assurance and Overtesting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336454/","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardness Assurance and Overtesting","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n6-83.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034382S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"4336371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4336454","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4336479,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It has been experimentally observed that drift conduction usually plays a dominant role when the ion track penetrates a junction. The first charge collection analysis concentrated on the diffusion conduction process. A recent analysis emphasizes drift conduction and describes the \"funnel\" which produces drift collection from the substrate. The funneling phenomenon has been modelled using two-dimensional computer simulations. It is extremely desirable to develop analytical solutions tp better understand the problem and to provide the basis for modelling the effect in circuit and system analysis computer codes such as SYSCAP. This paper develops an approximate analytic solution expressed as I(t) = Io [exp(-\u03b1t) - exp (-\u00dft)] (1) where Io is approximately the maximum current, 1/\u03b2 is the collection time constant of the junction, and 1/\u00df is the time constant for initially establishing the ion track. The junction time constant is shown to be K\u03b5o/q\u03bcND, and it increases slowly with funnel length when a funnel is present. The analysis shows that the excess carriers move almost exclusively by ambipolar diffusion for very early times, and that the fields present in semiconductor devices, including p-n junction fields, collapse. Ambipolar diffusion proceeds until the excess carrier concentration is reduced to approximately the background doping density at which time the junction field is restored and the carriers move by drift.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","volume":"29","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Collection of Charge on Junction Nodes from Ion Tracks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collection of Charge on Junction Nodes from Ion Tracks","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n6-119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022698S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"4336371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"466","articleId":"4336490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4336491,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper we present a simple method of calculating cosmic ray upset rates. We compare the results of this method to results of an exact calculation and apply both methods to the prediction of upset rates as device feature sizes are scaled to submicron dimensions. The exact calculations are presented for several environmental predictions. We then discuss upset critical charge as a function of feature size. We consider upset rates versus scale parameter as a function of device size and critical charge. We conclude that upset rates do not increase catastrophically as devices scale down, but that the problem will be serious for all technologies. We also conclude that devices with small feature sizes will be susceptible to upsets by proton induced reactions, so that they will have serious problems in the proton radiation belt.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of Cosmic-Ray Induced Soft Upsets and Scaling in VLSI Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of Cosmic-Ray Induced Soft Upsets and Scaling in VLSI Devices","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n6-124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029628S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"4336371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"108","articleId":"4336495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4336500,"authors":[{"name":"D.

To apply these techniques, the transient annealing response of several MOS capacitors with hardened gate oxides is measured following short pulsed LINAC irradiation. These responses were found to deviate at late times (0>105 s) from a generally observed linear-with-ln(t) behavior. If device response is assumed to be linear with ln(t) for all times of interest, a smaller radiation response is predicted than is actually measured following low-dose-rate 60Co irradiations at 145 and 0.2 rad(SiO2)/s. To improve on the prediction of device response using linear (with dose) system theory, a numerical integration was performed of the measured transient annealing curve in the ionizing radiation environment. Although this approach provides an excellent fit to the data for the 145-rad(SiO2)/s 60Co irradiation, it yields relatively poor agreement for the 0.2-rad(SiO2)/s 60Co irradiation. 60Co irradiations at 0.2 rad(SiO2)/s indicate an enhanced response from that predicted based on 60Co measurements at 145 rad(SiO2)/s. This dependence of MOS capacitor response on dose rate has been observed for several different gate oxides. Testing at higher dose rates may therefore suggest devices are acceptable that will in fact fail in a low dose-rate environment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4336371/04336504.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1982.4336504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1982.4336504","startPage":"2101","endPage":"2106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations in the Use of Linear System Theory for the Prediction of Hardened-MOS Device Response in Space Satellite Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336504/","displayDocTitle":"Limitations in the Use of Linear System Theory for the Prediction of Hardened-MOS Device Response in Space Satellite Environments","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations in the Use of Linear System Theory for the Prediction of Hardened-MOS Device Response in Space Satellite Environments","sourcePdf":"TNS-v29-n6-133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073769S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"4336371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4336504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4336705,"authors":[{"name":"J.

When coupled to a 5\u00d75\u00d73 mm3 BGO crystal, its spectroscopic performance is found to be superior to that of a PMT coupled to the same crystal, owing largely to its higher quantum efficiency. At room temperature, the APD achieves better energy resolution than any other (unity gain) solid state photodetector currently available; at -15 \u00b0C, its spectroscopic performance is comnparable to that of large area p-i-n photodiodes at -150 \u00b0C.

The technique of inverse Monte Carlo is used to find an inverse solution to the photon transport equation (an integral equation for photon flux from a specified source) for a parameterized source and specific boundary conditions. The system of linear equations so formed is solved to yield the source activity distribution for a set of acquired projections. For the studies presented here, the equations are solved using the EM (Maximum Likelihood) algorithm although other solution algorithms, such as Least Squares, could be employed. While the present results specifically consider the reconstruction of camera-based Single Photon Emission Computed Tomographic (SPECT) images, the technique is equally valid for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) if a Monte Carlo model of such a system is used. As a preliminary evaluation, experimentally acquired SPECT phantom studies for imaging Tc-99m (140 keV) are presented which demonstrate the quantitative compensation for scatter and attenuation for a two dimensional (single slice) reconstruction. The algorithm may be expanded in a straight forward manner to full three dimensional reconstruction including compensation for out of plane scatter.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4336940","startPage":"779","endPage":"785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4336772/04336940.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4336940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse Monte Carlo: A Unified Reconstruction Algorithm for SPECT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Reconstruction algorithms","Integral equations","Electromagnetic scattering","Particle scattering","Single photon emission computed tomography","Image reconstruction","Attenuation","Positron emission tomography","Computed tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Inverse Monte Carlo: A Unified Reconstruction Algorithm for SPECT","volume":"32","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse Monte Carlo: A Unified Reconstruction Algorithm for SPECT","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n1-168.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050075S","chronDate":"Feb.  1985","isNumber":"4336772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"159","articleId":"4336940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4336946,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This increases resolution and eliminates aliasing noise. With discrete detector movement there is a fairly long minimum scan duration. Continuous precession (wobble) allows shorter scans but increases in on-line memory needed. We modified the Positome III at the Montreal Neurological Institute to allow it to precess continuously, and interpolate the coincidence data in real time into uniformly sampled parallel projections. We are now able to perform 12 mm resolution scans of any frame rate greater than 2 seconds using 30% of the memory previously needed. Furthermore, we have reduced the reconstruction time by one third.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Detectors","Sensor arrays","Image reconstruction","Object detection","Photonic crystals","Sampling methods","Motion detection","Image sampling","Data acquisition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.1985.4336946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4336772/04336946.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4336772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1985.4336946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Data Rebinning in PET to Obtain Uniformly Sampled Projections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4336946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Data Rebinning in PET to Obtain Uniformly Sampled Projections","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4336946/","volume":"32","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Data Rebinning in PET to Obtain Uniformly Sampled Projections","sourcePdf":"TNS-v32-n1-174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033457S","chronDate":"Feb.  1985","isNumber":"4336772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4336946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4336948,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We have found that the non-linear MLE algorithm can be used with pixel sizes which are smaller than the sampling distance, without interpolation, obtaining excellent resolution and no noticeable increase in noise. We have studied the role of symmetry in reducing the amount of matrix element storage requirements for full size applications of the algorithm and have used that concept to carry out two reconstructions of the Derenzo phantom with data from the ECAT-III instrument. The results show excellent signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, particularly for data with low total counts, excellent sharpness, but low contrast at high frequencies when using the Shepp-Vardi model for probability matrices.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4337145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337028/04337145.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4337145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Practical Implementation of the MLE Algorithm for Positron Emission Tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards a Practical Implementation of the MLE Algorithm for Positron Emission Tomography","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1986","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a Practical Implementation of the MLE Algorithm for Positron Emission Tomography","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n1-117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051106S","chronDate":"Feb.  1986","isNumber":"4337028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4337145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4337163,"authors":[{"name":"Joel S.

We have measured 5.2 mm transverse and 6.0 mm axial spatial resolution, with an array of thirty 5-cm PMTs (10-columns by 3 rows). The pulses are shortened and integrated for 240 nsec, which results in a countrate capability of up to 1 Mcps without significant loss of spatial resolution. Although the one-dimensional detector upon which this one is based used analog processing to determine the position of an event, we now use digital processing because of the potential advantages it offers. We can implement variable integration which allows one to choose the optimal setting for high countrate capability and best spatial resolution. Resolution did not improve with longer integration times to the degree expected; however, at 240-nsec integration time resolution was only 0.6 mm worse than the best resolution achieved with longer integration time. This shorter integration time considerably extends our countrate capability and may obviate the need for variable integration for all but the highest countrates. The ability to perform position arithmetics more complicated than a simple centroid calculation might also help localizing the event in two dimensions. Digital processing allows us to use different biases for the transverse and axial centroid calculations, and to vary the bias as a function of position, which helps to extend the useful area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Evemt Localization in a Continuous Scintillation Detector Using Digital Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evemt Localization in a Continuous Scintillation Detector Using Digital Processing","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n1-135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059932S","chronDate":"Feb.  1986","isNumber":"4337028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4337163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4337164,"authors":[{"name":"H.

These data rates allow the acquisition of adequate transmission data in a reasonable amount of time. Good timing resolution minimizes accidental coincidences and permits data rates greater than 100,000 image-forming events per second for high-speed dynamic emission tomography.

This design replaces the conventional detector ring with multiple staggered layers of detector rings. The thickness of the layers is increasing exponentially. The SEMS design can improve the spatial resolution, allowing the detector ring to be smaller and obviate the need for detector wobbling. The improvement is particularly significant in high resolution PETs and PETs designed for small objects such as the brain, animals, limbs and infants. Image resolution approaching the theoretical limit of positron-range can be achieved for the entire field of view (FOV), rather than just at the center of the FOV in the conventional design. The reduction in detector ring size increases the sensitivity and lower the cost of both the gantry and detection system. The elimimation of detector motion simplifies the gantry mechanics and cost. In addition, the image artifact resulting from the frequency beating of the heart cycle and detector wobbling cycle are also eliminated. The high resolution, high sensitivity, compactness and low cost make this design suitable for researches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337028/04337172.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1986.4337172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1986.4337172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing a Stratified Detection System for PET Cameras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Cameras","Detectors","Costs","Spatial resolution","Animals","Pediatrics","Image resolution","Motion detection","Frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Designing a Stratified Detection System for PET Cameras","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing a Stratified Detection System for PET Cameras","sourcePdf":"TNS-v33-n1-144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028304S","chronDate":"Feb.  1986","isNumber":"4337028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4337172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4337174,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Due to the small signals from the detectors (< .03 pC/MeV), a preamplifier with ultra-low noise performance in the 5 to 20 MHz range is essential to achieve the timing resolution required by the PET application. Out of many available technologies, a new third generation MOSFET wqas selected and implemented as input transistor in an original charge sensitive (CSP) design. Performance among the best reported to date are obtained. The new design was implemented as a dual-channel preamplifier in high density hybrid (thick film) technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337283/04337308.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1987.4337308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1987.4337308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Low Noise Charge Sensitive Preamplifier for Scintillation Detection with Avalanche Photodiodes in PET Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Preamplifiers","Solid scintillation detectors","Avalanche photodiodes","Positron emission tomography","Signal resolution","Scintillation counters","Signal detection","Timing","MOSFET circuits","Thick films"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Low Noise Charge Sensitive Preamplifier for Scintillation Detection with Avalanche Photodiodes in PET Applications","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Low Noise Charge Sensitive Preamplifier for Scintillation Detection with Avalanche Photodiodes in PET Applications","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n1-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05674S","chronDate":"Feb.  1987","isNumber":"4337283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"21","articleId":"4337308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4337309,"authors":[{"name":"Neal H.

The timing delays and pulse height windows for all 600 detectors and the coincidence timing windows are computer adjustable. An orbiting positron source is used for transmission measurements and a look-up table is used to reject scattered and random coincidences that do not pass through the source.

The systems consist of gamma cameras equipped with collimators which view an object to be imaged with an increased sampling density in the vicinity of the center of a field-of-view. The detection systems produce weighted projection data. Evaluation was made with respect to noise characteristics in images resulting from such systems. Simulation studies showed that dual and quadruple camera systems equipped with a combination of fan beam collimators result in noise reduction of about 37% at the center of image and uniform noise over an image area, compared with systems equipped with parallel hole collimators.

Long term ionization effects on the value of the displacement damage factors were taken into account. In calculating the energy dependence of the nonionizing energy deposition, Rutherford, nuclear elastic, and nuclear inelastic interactions, and Lindhard energy partition were considered. The main conclusions of the work are as follows: 1) The ratio of the displacement damage factors for a given charged particle to the 1 MeV equivalent neutron damage factor, as a function of energy, falls on a common curve which is independent of collector current. 2) Deuterons of a given energy are about twice as damaging as protons and helium ions are about eighteen times as damaging as protons.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation of Particle-Induced Displacement Damage in Silicon","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1987.4337442","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337426/04337442.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1987.4337442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Correlation of Particle-Induced Displacement Damage in Silicon","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation of Particle-Induced Displacement Damage in Silicon","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073312S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"141","articleId":"4337442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337443,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These six process lines represent six different U. S. semiconductor companies. In their radiation response, these processes range from very hard to very soft. In the softer processes, the radiation-induced leakage currents are due to the turning on of a leakage path either under the thick field-oxide or along the transistor edge (bird's beak) region. In the hardest process, the field-oxide did not turn on, and the leakage was entirely due to subthreshold current in the gate region. These different mechanisms have qualitatively different time dependences, which we describe and discuss. We also discuss the implications of our results for hardness assurance testing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337450/","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Post-Irradiation Effects in Field-Oxide Isolation Structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-Irradiation Effects in Field-Oxide Isolation Structures","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083771S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"87","articleId":"4337450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4337452,"authors":[{"name":"Richard J.

The first moment of the resulting charge distribution is calculated to yield the midgap voltage shift as a function of irradiation time. The initial midgap voltage shift per dose and the maximum midgap voltage shift are derived. The field dependence of these quantities is shown to be a consequence of the field dependence of the hole/electron capture cross sections and geminate recombination escape probability The results of this formulation show that the E-1/2 decrease in the midgap shift per dose with field described in the literature is due to the decrease of the hole capture cross section with increasing applied field. The theory is validated by comparison with experimental results obtained on 225 A thermal oxide on p-type silicon test capacitors irradiated under bias at room temperature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applied Field and Total Dose Dependence of Trapped Charge Buildup in MOS Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applied Field and Total Dose Dependence of Trapped Charge Buildup in MOS Devices","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035997S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"68","articleId":"4337452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337455,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

Key findings of this study were the following: 1) hard errors are caused by a combination of energy deposited by the ion and from electrical conduction through the plasma channel formed by the ion strike, 2) there is an inverse linear relationship between ion energy deposition and the bias voltage required for composite device failure and 3) the angular dependence of the failure threshold voltage closely follows an inverse cosine relationship. Empirical equations are presented that allow the critical failure thresholds to be calculated from the ion LET for both silicon dioxide and metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor (MNOS) composite devices.

Decoupling resistors in the LRAM are used only to protect against the short n-channel transient; longer persisting pulses are reduced in magnitude by a voltage divider, a basically new concept for SEU protection. In such a design, smaller resistors provide SEU tolerance, allowing higher performance, hardened memories. As basis for the LRAM idea, techniques were developed to measure time constants for ion induced voltage transients in conventional static random access memories, SRAM. Time constants of 0.8 and 6.3 nsec were measured for transients following strikes at the n- and p-channel drains, respectively--primary areas of SEU sensitivity. These data are the first transient time measurements on full memory chips and the large difference is fundamental to the LRAM concept. Test structures of the new design exhibit equivalent SEU tolerance with resistors 5-to-10 times smaller than currently used in SRAM. Our advanced transport-plus-circuit numerical simulations of the SEU process predicted this result and account for the LRAM experiments, as well as a variety of experiments on conventional SRAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337466/","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An SEU Tolerant Memory Cell Derived from Fundamental Studies of SEU Mechanisms in SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SEU Tolerant Memory Cell Derived from Fundamental Studies of SEU Mechanisms in SRAM","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-40.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074682S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"45","articleId":"4337466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337468,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Failure was defined \"parametrically,\" such that an IC fails if one of its parameters, e.g., static power supply current or timing, exceeds a preset specification following irradiation. These studies demonstrate that the dominant failure mechanisms of SRAMs in space radiation environments are often quite different than those observed at considerably higher laboratory dose rates specified by DoD test guidelines, i.e., 100 to 300 rad(Si)/s. In addition, the total-dose hardness of SRAMs varied significantly between laboratory and space dose rates. Several approaches are discussed for predicting total-dose hardness of ICs in space from laboratory measurements. Results are also presented for transistors irradiated over the same range of dose rate (200 to 0.02 rad(Si)/s) and at all biases, i.e., N-on/off and P-on/off. These transistor measurements are used to characterize the physical mechanisms that govern the radiation response of the more complex SRAMs. In a surprising result, a dose-rate dependence for the buildup of radiation-induced interface states was observed. At dose rates from 200 to 0.02 rad(Si)/s, the number of interface states at a given total dose increased as the dose rate decreased.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Space technology","CMOS technology","Laboratories","Interface states","Radiation hardening","Integrated circuit technology","Current supplies","Power supplies","Timing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337496","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1987.4337496","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337426/04337496.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1987.4337496","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total-Dose Failure Mechanisms of Integrated Circuits in Laboratory and Space Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Total-Dose Failure Mechanisms of Integrated Circuits in Laboratory and Space Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-Dose Failure Mechanisms of Integrated Circuits in Laboratory and Space Environments","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-70.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040163S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"61","articleId":"4337496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337497,"authors":[{"name":"William C.

The timing sampler consists of 64 inverter-pair stages with sampling latches anid decoder circuitry. The sampler is used to measure inverter-pair propagation delays, which are nominally 2.5 nanoseconds, with a resolutioni of 100 picoseconds. A simple model was developed to explain the radiation-induced inverter-pair delay shifts in terms of radiation-induced MOSFET-threshold voltage shifts and effective nodal capacitances. The magnitude of the shift in pair delay with radiation was estimated at the point where the n-MOSFET threshold voltage became zero. For a 0.7-volt threshold shift, the pairdelay increased from its preradiation value by 360 picoseconds for a rising step iniput and decreased by 190 picoseconds for a falling step input.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation delay","Timing","Extraterrestrial measurements","Semiconductor device measurement","Circuit testing","Delay estimation","Radiation effects","Satellites","Sampling methods","Latches"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.1987.4337501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337426/04337501.pdf","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1987.4337501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Delay Measurements from a Timing Sampler Intended for Use in Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Delay Measurements from a Timing Sampler Intended for Use in Space","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337501/","volume":"34","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Delay Measurements from a Timing Sampler Intended for Use in Space","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-75.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048463S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4337501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4337502,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The importance of surface recombination is demonstrated along with the absence of bias dependence. Bulk damage is shown to be important for high energy electron irradiation because of wide-base pnp transistors. This causes substantial differences in device failure between electron and cobalt-60 environments that need to be taken into account for test standards and data bases that include commercial bipolar integrated circuits.

We find that comparisons of voltage shifts produced by bulk trapped charge and interface states in MOS transistors irradiated using two different low energy x-ray sources (an ARACOR 10 keV W source and an 8 keV Cu source) agree to within better than 30 percent. This quality of agreement is similar in magnitude to that between MOS devices irradiated by different Co-60 sources. In contrast, the measurements indicate that interlaboratory comparisons of ratios of shifts produced by x-ray and Co-60 sources can lead to differences in ratios as large as a factor of ~1.7. Improved electron-hole recombination data for oxides is presented. This recombination correction, in conjunction with a correction for interface dose enhancement, is used to predict the ratios of shifts produced by x-ray and Co-60 sources. However, the results show that corrections for electron-hole recombination and interface dose enhancement do not, by themselves, adequately predict the field dependent behavior of these transistors.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337426/04337511.pdf","startPage":"1535","endPage":"1539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evaluation of Low-Energy X-Ray and Cobalt-60 Irradiations of MOS Transistors","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1987.4337511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1987.4337511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation of Low-Energy X-Ray and Cobalt-60 Irradiations of MOS Transistors","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation of Low-Energy X-Ray and Cobalt-60 Irradiations of MOS Transistors","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-85.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060562S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"100","articleId":"4337511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337526,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A prime focus is the relationship between proton displacement and ionization effects and the separate consideration of neutron-induced displacement and gamma-ionization effects in TREE characterization. Recent definitive work on proton and neutron displacement damage in silicon in terms of nonionizing energy loss has laid the groundwork for comparison of proton effects with the TREE data base. We initiate this comparison with a summary of device radiation susceptibilities in neutron and gamma environments. Proton interactions in silicon devices are then presented in terms of dose deposition and nonionizing energy loss. This leads to a neutron-proton damage equivalence factor and enables the development of simple correspondence. The device susceptibility charts are then combined so both displacement damage and ionization-damage can be schematically examined relative to proton dose. These susceptibility charts demonstrate the dominance of ionization effects for damage in a proton environment for modern silicon microcircuit technologies. This approach is presented as a convenient means of interpreting effects for both proton exposures and TREE simulators. It is concluded that TREE characterization can be used as a good first-order estimate of proton damage effects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4337426/04337526.pdf","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1987.4337526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1987.4337526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Neutron, Proton and Gamma Ray Effects in Semiconductor Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neutrons","Gamma ray effects","Semiconductor devices","Ionization","Silicon","Testing","Energy loss","Proton effects","Radiation effects","Degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Neutron, Proton and Gamma Ray Effects in Semiconductor Devices","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Neutron, Proton and Gamma Ray Effects in Semiconductor Devices","sourcePdf":"TNS-v34-n6-100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049588S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4337426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4337526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337529,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Verghese","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Verghese","id":"37380730300"},{"name":"Jimmie J.

A method is then developed for simulating the minimum-error demodulation with a digital computer for the case of additive white Gaussian noise. By a Monte Carlo technique, minimum-error probabilities are computed for Gaussian data for n = 2 and n = 1, and for 3-bit and 6-bit words. The results are applicable regardless of the waveforms used to represent the binary digits (or bits). These results indicate that for word-error probabilities less than about 0.1, no very significant power gains accrue from the use of statistical dependence in the data unless the correlation coefficients between data samples are large (i.e., 0.98 or greater) for a large number of transmitted samples. However, the results also indicate that the effect of using the statistical dependence in the data is to reduce errors in the high order (most significant) bits of the code.

Only the situation of an unmodulated sinusoid embedded in additive white Gaussian noise has been considered. The threshold signal-to-noise power ratio in the two-sided loop noise bandwidth of a phase-lock receiver of arbitrary transfer function was found to be 1.34 db. At threshold the rms loop error is 1.0 radian. The special situation of a high gain second-order receiver was also treated. In order to compare the analytical results with possible future measurements, the high S/N bandwidth was chosen as a reference point. Referred to this high S/N bandwidth, the threshold signal-to-noise power ratio of -0.2 db and a corresponding rms loop error of 1.16 radians were derived. The applicability of Booton's linearization procedure to nonlinear systems with statistical inputs has been experimentally verified in control system applications similar in nature to the phase-lock loop with excellent results. It is therefore anticipated that the application to phase-lock loop analysis should yield a mathematical model which describes the system more closely than strictly linear approximations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/4335581/4337587/04337591.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSET.1963.4337591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSET.1963.4337591","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytic Approximation of Phase-Lock Receiver Threshold","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1963","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337591/","displayDocTitle":"An Analytic Approximation of Phase-Lock Receiver Threshold","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"March 1963","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytic Approximation of Phase-Lock Receiver Threshold","sourcePdf":"TSET1-v9-n1-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023325S","chronDate":"March  1963","isNumber":"4337587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4337591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337593,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Although theoretical investigation has indicated some carrier power reduction can be obtained over standard FM, it has been difficult to estimate the operating capabilities of the system. In addition, little has been published concerning the best parameter values for the construction of a typical feedback receiver. This paper is devoted to a study of the feedback FM receiver which maximizes power savings over standard FM for a given desired output SNR. System parameters such as transmitter modulation index, loop gain IF bandwidth, and baseband filter bandwidth are specified corresponding to this optimum design. Particular attention is given to the output SNR in the range from 15 db to 50 db where most practical analog systems usually operate. The paper deals only with the feedback loop containing two stages of filtering; design procedure is also given when added constraints are imposed in terms of loop transient response. The possibility of using phase-lock loops as the discriminator within the FM feedback loop is also investigated. Some experimental results are quoted which tend to verify the design techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Space Electronics and Telemetry","pdfPath":"/iel5/4335581/4337587/04337593.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSET.1963.4337593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSET.1963.4337593","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter Power Reduction with Frequency Tracking FM Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1963","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337593/","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter Power Reduction with Frequency Tracking FM Receivers","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"March 1963","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter Power Reduction with Frequency Tracking FM Receivers","sourcePdf":"TSET1-v9-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033611S","chronDate":"March  1963","isNumber":"4337587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","articleId":"4337593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337601,"authors":[{"name":"Randall M.

Phase-locked loops can convert each received signal of a diversity system to an essentially constant frequency and phase for coherent combination prior to demodulation. When the individual signals are fading with some amount of independence, the properly combined signal has less severe amplitude fluctuations than either signal alone and a diversity improvement results. While practical systems of this type have proved very effective, they have a disadvantage in that each of the phase-locked loops are controlled by the individually fading signals. This paper describes a multiple-input servosystem in which a primary phase-locked loop is controlled by the combined signal while auxiliary loops within the primary loop assure phase coherence. In this way, the full diversity improvement is realized in both locking and in demodulation and the probability of losing lock is correspondingly decreased. The probability of a single-input phase-locked loop losing lock is established and then extended to the case of a slowly fading signal with Rayleigh envelope characteristics. The statistics of two such signals optimally combined are used to arrive at a comparative estimate of the improvement possible. A practical diversity-locked combiner is analyzed and design criteria are established.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1963","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337616/","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1963","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Diversity-Locked Loop a Coherent Combiner","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Diversity-Locked Loop a Coherent Combiner","sourcePdf":"TSET1-v9-n3-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076787S","chronDate":"Sept.  1963","isNumber":"4337608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4337616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4337625,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, such relationships yielding the exact decoder output error rates are developed for Hamming SED codes of lengths n = 2m - 1, m = 1, 2, 3,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, and for Hamming SEC/DED codes of length n = 2m, m = 1, 2, 3,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. In addition, for the DED codes, a similar family of formulas are derived for the probability that a received information binit is contained in a word containing an error pattern that can be detected but not corrected. A criterion of merit for the coded versus uncoded systems is postulated. A similar criterion is developed based upon word error rates. It is demonstrated that the latter results, in general, in highly erroneous conclusions regarding the comparative worth of coded systems. Graphs are presented illustrating the numerical results based on these formulas for codes ranging in length from 7/8 binits up to and including 511/512 binits, for uncoded channel error rates of 0.5 to 10-10. Similar graphs of code merit, based upon modulation systems for which detection is a linear operation (PSK-MF, for example), are constructed. From these, ranges of channel (uncoded) error probability over which particular code lengths result in the best performance that can be obtained from that type of code are extracted and tabulated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1963","publicationDate":"Dec. 1963","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Hamming Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Hamming Codes","sourcePdf":"TSET1-v9-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036108S","chronDate":"Dec.  1963","isNumber":"4337620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4335581","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4337625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4337663,"authors":[{"name":"Mark T.

The proposed envelope detector adopts the quadrature demodulation and the look-up table (LUT) method to compute the magnitude of the complex baseband components of received echo signals. Because the direct use of the LUT method for a square root function is not feasible due to a large memory size, this paper presents a new LUT strategy dramatically reducing its size by using binary logarithmic number system (BLNS). Due to the nature of BLNS, the proposed design does not require an individual LOG-compression functional block. In the implementation using a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a total of 166.56 Kbytes memories were used for computing the magnitude of 16-bit in-phase and quadrature components instead of 4 Gbytes in the case of the direct use of the LUT method. The experimental results show that the proposed envelope detector is capable of generating LOG- compressed envelope data at every clock cycle after 32 clock cycle latency, and its maximum error is less than 0.5 (i.e., within the rounding error), compared with the arithmetic results of square root function and LOG compression.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2007.463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4337722/04337739.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2007.463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337722","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Envelope Detector for High-Frame Rate, High-Frequency Ultrasound Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Envelope Detector for High-Frame Rate, High-Frequency Ultrasound Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9628083","pubMedId":"17941385","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4337739/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Envelope Detector for High-Frame Rate, High-Frequency Ultrasound Imaging","sourcePdf":"t0791792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162834S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4337722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4337722","articleId":"4337739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337741,"authors":[{"name":"Niels Oddershede","affiliation":["Fast Ultrasound Imaging Orsted DTU, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4337722/4337741/4337741-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Niels Oddershede was born in Thisted, Denmark, in 1979.

Data are beamformed at different directions through a point, where the velocity is estimated. The flow direction is estimated by a search for the direction where the normalized cross-correlation peaks and the velocity magnitude along this direction are found. In this paper, different effects that influence the focusing in this method are investigated. These include the effect of phase errors in the emitted spherical waves, motion effects, and the effect of various interpolation methods in beam- forming. A model based on amplitude drop and phase error for spherical waves created using the virtual source concept is derived. This model can be used to determine the opening angle of a virtual source. Simulations for different virtual source placements are made, and it is recommended that the virtual sources be placed behind the aperture when shallow structures are imaged, and when deeper-lying structures are imaged the virtual sources be placed in front of the aperture. Synthetic aperture methods involve summation of data from numerous emissions. Motion between these emissions results in incoherence and affects resolution, contrast, and the signal-to-noise ratio. The effects of motion on the synthetic aperture vector velocity estimation method are investigated, and it is shown that for both axial and lateral motion, the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio can be seriously affected. A compensation method using the previous vector velocity estimate, when new data are beamformed, is implemented and tested. It is shown from a number of flow phantom experiments that a significant improvement with respect to bias and standard deviation of the velocity estimates can be obtained by using this compensation. Increased performance is gained at the expense of computation time. Different interpolation methods can be used for beam- forming the data. In this paper, the velocity estimation performance using various more complex interpolation schemes are compared to that using linear interpolation. No significant difference in the performance of the method is seen when other interpolation methods are used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects Influencing Focusing in Synthetic Aperture Vector Flow Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2007.465","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4337722/04337741.pdf","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2007.465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","displayDocTitle":"Effects Influencing Focusing in Synthetic Aperture Vector Flow Imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4337741/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9628085","pubMedId":"17941387","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects Influencing Focusing in Synthetic Aperture Vector Flow Imaging","sourcePdf":"t0791811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160258S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4337722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4337722","articleId":"4337741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337745,"authors":[{"name":"Hyeoungwoo Kim","affiliation":["Automation and Robotics Research Institute, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4337722/4337745/4337745-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyeoungwoo Kim is a postdoctoral fellow at Automation and Robotics Research Institute, University of Texas at Arlington.

Second, a transducer structure, cymbal, was optimized and fabricated to match the mechanical impedance of vibration source to that of the piezoelectric transducer. The cymbal transducer was found to exhibit ~40 times higher effective strain coefficient than the piezoelectric ceramics. Third, the electrical impedance matching for the energy harvesting circuit was considered to allow the transfer of generated power to a storage media. It was found that, by using the 10-layer ceramics instead of the single layer, the output current can be increased by 10 times, and the output load can be reduced by 40 times. Furthermore, by using the multilayer ceramics the output power was found to increase by 100%. A direct current (DC)-DC buck converter was fabricated to transfer the accumulated electrical energy in a capacitor to a lower output load. The converter was optimized such that it required less than 5 mW for operation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2007.469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4337722/04337745.pdf","endPage":"1859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consideration of Impedance Matching Techniques for Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2007.469","startPage":"1851","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Consideration of Impedance Matching Techniques for Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337745/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9628087","pubMedId":"17941391","publicationDate":"September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4337745/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consideration of Impedance Matching Techniques for Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"t0791851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047277S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4337722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4337722","articleId":"4337745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":4337749,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy A.

The element electrodes were created using photolithography, and connections to the electrodes were made using ultrasonic wire bonding. The array was focused in the elevation direction by geometrically shaping the composite material using a cylindrical die with a 6-mm radius of curvature. The resulting transducer produced pulses with a -6 dB two-way bandwidth of 50% and a peak-to-peak pressure of 503 kPa when excited with a plusmn30 V monocycle pulse. The measured one-way ( -6 dB) directivity for a single array element was 24 degrees and the -3 dB one-way elevation beamwidth was measured to be 130 mum. The radiation pattern for a focused 64-element subaperture was measured by mechanically translating the aperture above a needle hydrophone. A -3 dB one-way beamwidth of 97 mum was found at a depth of 6 mm.

Unlike most existing denoising algorithms, using the SURE makes it needless to hypothesize a statistical model for the noiseless image. A key point of our approach is that, although the (nonlinear) processing is performed in a transformed domain-typically, an undecimated discrete wavelet transform, but we also address nonorthonormal transforms-this minimization is performed in the image domain. Indeed, we demonstrate that, when the transform is a ldquotightrdquo frame (an undecimated wavelet transform using orthonormal filters), separate subband minimization yields substantially worse results. In order for our approach to be viable, we add another principle, that the denoising process can be expressed as a linear combination of elementary denoising processes-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">linear expansion of thresholds </i>\n(LET).

Some specific issues have already been addressed as testified by the wide literature on the so-called blind source separation (BSS) problem. In this context, as clearly emphasized by previous work, it is fundamental that the sources to be retrieved present some quantitatively measurable diversity. Recently, sparsity and morphological diversity have emerged as a novel and effective source of diversity for BSS. Here, we give some new and essential insights into the use of sparsity in source separation, and we outline the essential role of morphological diversity as being a source of diversity or contrast between the sources. This paper introduces a new BSS method coined generalized morphological component analysis (GMCA) that takes advantages of both morphological diversity and sparsity, using recent sparse overcomplete or redundant signal representations. GMCA is a fast and efficient BSS method. We present arguments and a discussion supporting the convergence of the GMCA algorithm. Numerical results in multivariate image and signal processing are given illustrating the good performance of GMCA and its robustness to noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9630218","htmlLink":"/document/4337755/","pubMedId":"17990743","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity and Morphological Diversity in Blind Source Separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity and Morphological Diversity in Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"16tip11-bobin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108396S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4337753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4337753","articleId":"4337755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4337756,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00c9r\u00d4me Bobin","affiliation":["DAPNIA/SEDI-SAP, Service dAstrophysique, CEA Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4337753/4337756/4337756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bobin graduated from the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) de Cachan, France, in 2005, and received the M.Sc. degree in signal and image processing from ENS Cachan and the Universit\u00e9 Paris XI, Orsay, France.

In particular, given the values of a photometric variable (or of a set thereof), which is to be used for classifying the image pixels, the active contours are designed to converge to the shape that results in maximal discrepancy between the empirical distributions of the photometric variable inside and outside of the contours. The above discrepancy is measured by means of the Bhattacharyya distance that proves to be an extremely useful tool for solving the problem at hand. The proposed methodology can be viewed as a generalization of the segmentation methods, in which active contours maximize the difference between a finite number of empirical moments of the ldquoinsiderdquo and ldquooutsiderdquo distributions. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed methodology is very versatile and flexible in the sense that it allows one to easily accommodate a diversity of the image features based on which the segmentation should be performed. As an additional contribution, a method for automatically adjusting the smoothness properties of the empirical distributions is proposed. Such a procedure is crucial in situations when the number of data samples (supporting a certain segmentation class) varies considerably in the course of the evolution of the active contour. In this case, the smoothness properties of the empirical distributions have to be properly adjusted to avoid either over- or underestimation artifacts. Finally, a number of relevant segmentation results are demonstrated and some further research directions are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9630226","pubMedId":"17990755","volume":"16","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4337766/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image Segmentation Using Active Contours Driven by the Bhattacharyya Gradient Flow","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Segmentation Using Active Contours Driven by the Bhattacharyya Gradient Flow","sourcePdf":"16tip11-michailovich.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133859S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4337753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"4337753","articleId":"4337766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4337769,"authors":[{"name":"Deqing Sun","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4337753/4337769/4337769-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Deqing Sun (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

Postprocessing can reduce these distortions and alleviate the conflict between bit rate reduction and quality preservation. Viewing postprocessing as an inverse problem, we propose to solve it by the maximum a posteriori criterion. The distortion caused by coding is modeled as additive, spatially correlated Gaussian noise, while the original image is modeled as a high order Markov random field based on the fields of experts framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method, in most cases, achieves higher PSNR gain than other methods and the processed images possess good visual quality. In addition, we examine the noise model used and its parameter setting. The noise model assumes that the DCT coefficients and their quantization errors are independent.

Different from traditional maximum likelihood (ML) methods, in which classification is based on probabilities from independent individual class models as is the case for general hidden Markov model (HMM) methods, proposed method utilizes information from all classes to minimize classification error. The proposed approach uses a HMM for shape curvature as its 2-D shape descriptor. We introduce a weighted likelihood discriminant function and present a minimum classification error strategy based on generalized probabilistic descent method. We show comparative results obtained with our approach and classic ML classification with various HMM topologies alongside Fourier descriptor and Zernike moments-based support vector machine classification for a variety of shapes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4337753/04337770.pdf","startPage":"2707","endPage":"2719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.908076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.908076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Model-Based Weighted Likelihood Discriminant for 2-D Shape Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Shape","Topology","Surveillance","Feature extraction","Speech analysis","Support vector machine classification","Image analysis","Pattern analysis","Pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","image classification","maximum likelihood estimation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Zernike moments","support vector machine classification","Fourier descriptor","generalized probabilistic descent method","weighted likelihood discriminant function","2D shape descriptor","shape curvature","traditional maximum likelihood method","minimum error shape classification","hidden Markov model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov models (HMMs)","image shape analysis","pattern classification"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Discriminant Analysis","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Markov Chains","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Model-Based Weighted Likelihood Discriminant for 2-D Shape Classification","volume":"16","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4337770/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9630229","pubMedId":"17990748","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Model-Based Weighted Likelihood Discriminant for 2-D Shape Classification","sourcePdf":"16tip11-thakoor.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095615S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4337753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4337753","articleId":"4337770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337771,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Novelty consists of the network architecture and of dispensing with the standard assumption of epipolar geometry. Quite distinct from the existing algorithms which, typically, involve area- and/or feature-matching, the network is first initialized to the right image, and then deformed until it is transformed into the left image, or vice versa, this deformation itself being the measure of disparity. Illustrative examples include two classes of stereo pairs: synthetic and natural (including random-dot stereograms and wire frames) and distorted. The latter has one of the following special characteristics: one image is blurred, one image is of a different size, there are salient features like discontinuous depth values at boundaries and surface wrinkles, and there exist occluded and half-occluded regions. While these examples serve, in general, to demonstrate that the technique performs better than many existing algorithms, the above-mentioned stereo pairs (in particular, the last two) bring out some of its limitations, thereby serving as possible motivation for further work.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.906772","startPage":"2822","endPage":"2829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.906772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337753","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4337753/04337771.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Application of a Modified Self-Organizing Neural Network to Estimate Stereo Disparity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337771/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Application of a Modified Self-Organizing Neural Network to Estimate Stereo Disparity","volume":"16","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4337771/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9630230","pubMedId":"17990758","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Application of a Modified Self-Organizing Neural Network to Estimate Stereo Disparity","sourcePdf":"16tip11-venkatesh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119941S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4337753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4337753","articleId":"4337771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4337774,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["Institute of AeroSpace Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4337753/4337774/4337774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Yang received the B.S. degree in automation engineering and the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from the Shandong University of Technology, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

Each facet on the prism is integrated with a planar 1- or 2-D capacitive-micromachined ultrasonic-transducer imager array for viewing in a specific direction. Each facet is connected by a flexible dielectric membrane, which is monolithically fabricated with the transducers. The dielectric membranes also support the thin-film electrical interconnects between the arrays on different facets. The substrate is folded into a hexagonal prism after completion of the transducer microfabrication process. With this architecture, a one flip-chip bonded or monolithically integrated front-end electronic circuit will be able to manage all the imagers on the 3-D array. The number of bonding wires for a connection to external electronics can therefore be reduced. Imager prisms, which are ranging from 1 to 4 mm in diameter and 2 to 4 mm in length, and positioned to view in seven directions, have been prototyped. Preliminary testing shows that the imager transducers behaved consistently before and after the assembly process. Applications of this 3-D imager array include capsule ultrasound endoscope, intravascular ultrasound, and other internal imaging needs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4337780/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9633409","volume":"16","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Monolithic Three-Dimensional Ultrasonic Transducer Array for Medical Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Monolithic Three-Dimensional Ultrasonic Transducer Array for Medical Imaging","sourcePdf":"16jmems05-chen2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055413S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4337775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4337775","articleId":"4337780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337781,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4337775/4337781/4337781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Chen received the M.S. degree from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2003.

A long hard-baking process is proposed to realize the durable PR mask capable of withstanding a long etching process. In order to remove precipitated particles generated during the etching process, a new recipe of buffered oxide etching with addition of 20% HCl is also reported. A smooth surface microchannel with a depth of more than 110 mum is achieved after 2 h of etching. Meanwhile, a simple, fast, but reliable bonding process based on UV-curable glue has been developed which takes only 10 min to accomplish the efficient sealing of glass chips. The result shows that a high bonding yield (~ 100%) can be easily achieved without the requirement of clean room facilities and programmed high-temperature furnaces.

This micropump is implemented by taking advantage of both the electrolysis actuation and the surface tension effect. The surface tension effect is controlled via the periodic generation of electrolytic bubbles and the roughness gradient design of microchannel surface, which results in the specified variation of liquid contact angle along the microchannel. Our proposed micropump could resolve the disadvantages that exist in the early reported micropumps, such as the complicated time-sequence power control, the need of long nozzle-diffuser structure, and the choking/sticking phenomena of electrolytic bubbles in a microchannel. Due to the features of large actuation force, low-power consumption, and room temperature operation, our micropump is suitable for the development of low-power consumption and compact micropumps for various applications. Experimental results show that the liquid displacement and the pumping rate could be easily and accurately controlled by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of the applied voltage. With the applied voltage of 15 V at 4.5 Hz, a maximum pumping rate of 114 nl/min is achieved for one of our micropump designs with a microchannel of 100 x 20 mum.

The device consists of an actuator and a load sensor with a specimen in between. Two types of actuators, in-plane thermal and comb drive actuators, are used to pull the specimens in displacement control and force control modes, respectively. The load sensor works based on differential capacitive sensing, from which the sensor displacement is recorded. By determining sensor stiffness from mechanical resonance measurements, the load on the specimen is obtained. Load sensors with different stiffness were fabricated. The best resolutions were achieved with load sensors that are designed for testing nanotubes, reaching 0.05 fF in capacitance, 1 nm in displacement, and 12 nN in load. For the first time, this MEMS-based material testing scheme offers the possibility of continuous observation of the specimen deformation and fracture with subnanometer resolution, while simultaneously measuring the applied load electronically with nano-Newton resolution.

In this paper, we demonstrate an electrolytic-bubble-based approach to directly measure flow rate in microfluidic arteries. By simultaneously generating two gas bubbles electrochemically along a channel, we can measure the pressure difference (and thus flow rate) in real time. A prototype chip that measures flow rate was fabricated on silicon. The sensor was characterized for a functional microfluidic system with inlet pressure ranging from 108 to 135 kPa. The flow-meter performance was compared with computational fluid dynamics simulations and was also calibrated against other direct experiments. The impedance-based flow-rate measurements are easily achieved on a chip with a simple electronic circuit. The described approach can be integrated into any fluid circuit, particularly microfluidic channels that are too small to use off-shelf flow meters.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4337775/04337810.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1094","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2007.906078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2007.906078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrolytic-Bubble-Based Flow Sensor for Microfluidic Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Microfluidics","Fluid flow measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Arteries","Pressure measurement","Prototypes","Silicon","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Computational fluid dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bubbles","computational fluid dynamics","electrolytic devices","flow measurement","flow sensors","flowmeters","lab-on-a-chip","microchannel flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrolytic bubble","flow sensor","microfluidic systems","flow property control","microfluidic lab-chips","microfluidic arteries","gas bubbles","flow rate measurement","flowmeter","computational fluid dynamics","simple electronic circuit","fluid circuit","microfluidic channels","pressure 108 kPa to 135 kPa"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bubbles","impedance measurement","microelectromechanical devices","microsensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Electrolytic-Bubble-Based Flow Sensor for Microfluidic Systems","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4337810/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633432","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrolytic-Bubble-Based Flow Sensor for Microfluidic Systems","sourcePdf":"16jmems05-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131813S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4337775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4337775","articleId":"4337810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4337812,"authors":[{"name":"Liming Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4337775/4337812/4337812-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liming Yu was born in Zhejiang Province, China, in 1976.

A unique characteristic of our chip is that the walls of the microfluidic channels also constitute the device's electrodes. This property confers the opportunity to use the electrodes' shape to generate not only the electric field gradient required for dielectrophoretic force but also a fluid velocity gradient. This interesting combination gives rise to a new solution for the dielectrophoretic separation of two particle populations. The proposed sequential field-flow separation method consists of four steps. First, the microchannel is filled with the mixture of the two populations of particle. Second, the particle populations are trapped in different locations of the microfluidic channels. The population, which exhibits positive dielectrophoresis (DEP), is trapped in the area where the distance between the electrodes is the minimum, while the other population that exhibits negative DEP is trapped in locations of maximum distance between electrodes. In the next step, increasing the flow in the microchannels will result in an increased hydrodynamic force that sweeps the cell population trapped by positive DEP out of the chip. In the last step, the electric field is removed, and the second population is swept out and collected at the outlet. For theoretical and experimental exemplification of the separation method, a population of viable and nonviable yeast cells was considered.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2007.901136","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4337775/04337812.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2007.901136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Field-Flow Cell Separation Method in a Dielectrophoretic Chip With 3-D Electrodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337812/","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Field-Flow Cell Separation Method in a Dielectrophoretic Chip With 3-D Electrodes","volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633434","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4337812/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Field-Flow Cell Separation Method in a Dielectrophoretic Chip With 3-D Electrodes","sourcePdf":"16jmems05-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089944S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4337775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4337775","articleId":"4337812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4337827,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Appleby","affiliation":["QinetiQ Limited, Malvern, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4337826/4337827/4337827-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roger Appleby (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in chemistry from Leicester University, U.K., in 1974 and the Ph.D. degree (dissertation title: \u201cVibrational spectroscopy under pressure\u201d) in 1977.

Equipments operating in the submillimeter band can measure distance and also spectral information and have been used to address new opportunities in security. Solid state spectral information is available in the submillimeter region making it possible to identify materials, whereas in millimeter region bulk optical properties determine the image contrast. The optical properties in the region from 30 GHz to 3 THz are discussed for some typical inorganic and organic solids. In the millimeter-wave region of the spectrum, obscurants such as poor weather, dust, and smoke can be penetrated and useful imagery generated for surveillance. In the 30 GHz-3 THz region dielectrics such as plastic and cloth are also transparent and the detection of contraband hidden under clothing is possible. A passive millimeter-wave imaging concept based on a folded Schmidt camera has been developed and applied to poor weather navigation and security. The optical design uses a rotating mirror and is folded using polarization techniques. The design is very well corrected over a wide field of view making it ideal for surveillance and security.

Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT, Japan) started the Terahertz Project in April 2006. Its fundamental purpose in the next five years is to enable a nationwide technical infrastructure to be created for diverse applications of terahertz technology. The technical infrastructure includes the development of semiconductor devices such as terahertz quantum cascade lasers, terahertz-range quantum well photodetectors, and high-precision tunable continuous wave sources. It also includes pulsed terahertz measurement systems, modeling and measurement of atmospheric propagation, and the establishment of a framework to construct a materials database in the terahertz range including standardization of the measurement protocol. These are common technical infrastructure even in any terahertz systems. In this article, we report the current status of developments in these fields such as terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz-QCLs) (with peak power of 30 mW, 3.1 THz), terahertz-range quantum well photodetectors (THz-QWPs) (tuned at 3 THz) an ultrawideband terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system (with measurement range of from 0.1 to 15 THz), an example of a database for materials of fine art, and results obtained from measuring atmospheric propagation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.898844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337826","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4337826/04337842.pdf","endPage":"1623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"At the Dawn of a New Era in Terahertz Technology","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.898844","startPage":"1611","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4337842","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"At the Dawn of a New Era in Terahertz Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337842/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9633444","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"95","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"At the Dawn of a New Era in Terahertz Technology","sourcePdf":"95jproc08-hosako.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101317S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","isNumber":"4337826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"152","articleId":"4337842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4337845,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Bo Liu","affiliation":["Center for Terahertz Research, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4337826/4337845/4337845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hai-Bo Liu (Member, IEEE) was born in Guilin, China, in 1975.

As we expected, the soft and thick skin could absorb the impact on the landing of the body, and the resulting damage was minor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/100/4337752/04337966.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MRA.2007.901318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2007.901318","startPage":"43","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field and service appkications - Dinosaur robotics for entertainment applications - Design, Configurations, Controt, and Exhibition at the World Exposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4337966/","displayDocTitle":"Field and service appkications - Dinosaur robotics for entertainment applications - Design, Configurations, Controt, and Exhibition at the World Exposition","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4337966/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9642340","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field and service appkications - Dinosaur robotics for entertainment applications - Design, Configurations, Controt, and Exhibition at the World Exposition","sourcePdf":"142007-Hirohisa-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027884S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"100","isNumber":"4337752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"100","xplore-issue":"4337752","articleId":"4337966","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4337999,"authors":[{"name":"Peggy Decroix","affiliation":["Signal and Image Center, Royal Military Academy, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Peggy","lastName":"Decroix","id":"37660535300"},{"name":"Xavier Neyt","affiliation":["Signal and Image Center, Royal Military Academy, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Neyt","id":"37352476200"},{"name":"Marc Acheroy","affiliation":["Signal and Image Center, Royal Military Academy, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Acheroy","id":"37282004100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-7207-621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"4337999","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion measurement","Motion compensation","Position measurement","Aircraft","Global Positioning System","Low pass filters","Motion estimation","Filtering algorithms","Measurement errors","Pulse measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","motion compensation","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion measurement accuracy","airborne SAR motion compensation","airborne SAR data processing","accurate motion compensation"]}],"abstract":"When processing airborne SAR data, motion compensation is an unavoidable step.

Especially in the case of signal inherent periodicities the target echoes are often covered by sidelobes of clutter. In order to reduce high correlation sidelobes and enable highly accurate range measurements, a signal adaptive filter processing is introduced. Its mathematical description explains that aiming at low sidelobes and highly accurate range estimation for arbitrary signals results in a filter method providing a phase correlation. The SNR obtained by this filter method turns out to be dependent on the amplitude variation of the signal frequency spectrum. The effectiveness of the side lobe reduction is demonstrated on experimental data of analogue TV-signals to verify that accurate unambiguous range estimation is possible, even for strongly periodical signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Radar Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4337984/4337985/04338042.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2006 International Radar Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2006.4338042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2006.4338042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4337985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCL-Signal-Processing for Sidelobe Reduction in Case of Periodical Illuminator Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Object detection","Radar applications","Clutter","Signal processing","Frequency","Delay effects","Autocorrelation","Phase estimation","Adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","passive radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PCL-signal-processing","passive coherent location","adaptive filter processing","phase correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"PCL-Signal-Processing for Sidelobe Reduction in Case of Periodical Illuminator Signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4338042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"10299818","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","conferenceDate":"24-26 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCL-Signal-Processing for Sidelobe Reduction in Case of Periodical Illuminator Signals","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"IRS-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080929S","chronDate":"24-26 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4337984","isNumber":"4337985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4337984","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4337985","articleId":"4338042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Politechnika Warszawska Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4338044,"authors":[{"name":"Mateusz Malanowski","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Malanowski","id":"37548039900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-83-7207-621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"4338044","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar clutter","Least squares methods","Filtering","Adaptive filters","Interference suppression","Passive radar","Testing","Lattices","Convergence","Computational complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338044","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2006.4338044","publicationTitle":"2006 International Radar Symposium","abstract":"The paper presents a comparison of classical adaptive filters for suppression of direct path interference and ground clutter in Passive Coherent Location (PCL) radar.

In this paper, the proposed filters are designed at optimum SPREAD of the network in presence of range resolution and Doppler shift with additive noise to achieve high SSR and low ISL.

Wireless body area networks consist of wireless sensor nodes attached to the human body to monitor vital signs such as body temperature, activity or heart-rate. The network adopts a master-slave architecture, where the body-worn slave node periodically sends sensor readings to a central master node. Unlike traditional peer-to-peer wireless sensor networks, the nodes in this biomedical WBASN are not deployed in an ad hoc fashion. Joining a network is centrally managed and all communications are single-hop. To reduce energy consumption, all the sensor nodes are in standby or sleep mode until the centrally assigned time slot. Once a node has joined a network, there is no possibility of collision within a cluster as all communication is initiated by the central node and is addressed uniquely to a slave node. To avoid collisions with nearby transmitters, a clear channel assessment algorithm based on standard listen-before-transmit (LBT) is used. To handle time slot overlaps, the novel concept of a wakeup fallback time is introduced. Using single-hop communication and centrally controlled sleep/wakeup times leads to significant energy reductions for this application compared to more 'flexible' network MAC protocols such as 802.11 or Zigbee. With longer sleep times, the overall power consumption approaches the standby power. The protocol is implemented in hardware as part of the Sensium\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u2122</sup>\n system-on-chip WBASN ASIC, in a 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS process.","doi":"10.1109/ISSMDBS.2007.4338285","publicationTitle":"2007 4th IEEE/EMBS International Summer School and Symposium on Medical Devices and Biosensors","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 4th IEEE/EMBS International Summer School and Symposium on Medical Devices and Biosensors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338272/4338273/04338285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSMDBS.2007.4338285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338273","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Medium Access Protocol for Wireless Medical Body Area Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Medium Access Protocol for Wireless Medical Body Area Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338285/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9810833","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4338285/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Medium Access Protocol for Wireless Medical Body Area Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"ISSMDBS-00-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044438S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338272","isNumber":"4338273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338272","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4338273","articleId":"4338285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4338305,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Sheikhani","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Faculty, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sheikhani","id":"37704895300"},{"name":"Hamid Behnam","affiliation":["Department of Electical Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Behnam","id":"37541433800"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Mohammadi","affiliation":["Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Pschology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37664324500"},{"name":"Maryam Noroozian","affiliation":["Neurology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Noroozian","id":"37720282500"},{"name":"Pari Golabi","affiliation":["Omid Iranian Children Association, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Pari","lastName":"Golabi","id":"37704896900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1345-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1346-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4338305","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autism","Diseases","Fourier transforms","Time measurement","Electroencephalography","Neodymium","Variable speed drives","Frequency","Performance evaluation","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","Fourier transforms","neurophysiology","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantitative electroencephalography","EEG background activity","autism disorder patients","Lempel-Ziv complexity","short time Fourier transform","neurophysiologic disorders","frequency analysis","Mahalanobis distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LZ complexity","STFT","EEG","Autism disorders"]}],"abstract":"Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool for the evaluation and treatment of neurophysiologic disorders.

The traditional discriminative training, however, has been aimed to minimize empirical error rates on training sets, which may not be well generalized to test sets. Many attempts have been made recently to incorporate the principle of large margin (PLM) into the training of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in ASR to improve the generalization abilities. Significant error rate reduction on the test sets has been observed on both small vocabulary and large vocabulary continuous ASR tasks using large-margin discriminative training (LMDT) techniques. In this paper, we introduce the PLM, define the concept of margin in the HMMs, and survey a number of popular LMDT algorithms proposed and developed recently. Specifically, we review and compare the large-margin minimum classification error (LM-MCE) estimation, soft-margin estimation (SME), large margin estimation (LME), large relative margin estimation (LRME), and large margin training (LMT) with a focus on the insights, the training criteria, the optimization techniques used, and the strengths and weaknesses of these different approaches. We suggest future research directions in our conclusion of this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880210","htmlLink":"/document/4338378/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Large-Margin Discriminative Training of Hidden Markov Models for Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Margin Discriminative Training of Hidden Markov Models for Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"29970429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067047S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338315","isNumber":"4338316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338315","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4338316","articleId":"4338378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4338383,"authors":[{"name":"Jon Lathem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Lathem","id":"37704986300"},{"name":"Karthik Gomadam","affiliation":["Kno.e.sis center, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Gomadam","id":"37542836200"},{"name":"Amit P.

RESTful services often take the form of RSS/Atom feeds and AJAX based light weight services. The XML based messaging paradigm of RESTful services has made it possible to compose various services together. Such compositions of RESTful services is widely referred to as Mashups. In this paper, we outline the limitations in current approaches to creating mashups. We address these limitations by proposing a framework called as SA-REST. SA-REST adds semantics to RESTful services. Our proposed framework builds upon the original ideas in WSDL-S, our W3C submission, which was subsequently adapted for Semantic Annotation of WSDL (SAWSDL), now a W3C proposed recommendation. We demonstrate use of microformats for semantic annotation of RESTful services and then the use of such semanti- cally enabled services with better support for interoperability for creating dynamic mashups called SMashups.","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338315/4338316/04338383.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SA-REST and (S)mashups : Adding Semantics to RESTful Services","doi":"10.1109/ICSC.2007.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSC.2007.94","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"SA-REST and (S)mashups : Adding Semantics to RESTful Services","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880215","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4338383/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SA-REST and (S)mashups : Adding Semantics to RESTful Services","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"29970469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036478S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338315","isNumber":"4338316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338315","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4338316","articleId":"4338383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4338396,"authors":[{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407022500"},{"name":"Chengcui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Chengcui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37332830100"},{"name":"Shu-Ching Chen","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Science, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shu-Ching","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277598000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2997-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2997-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4338396","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338396","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Event detection","Indexing","Support vector machines","Computer networks","Data mining","Information retrieval","Multimedia databases","Bayesian methods","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer bootstrapping","feature extraction","neural nets","video retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network ensembles","video event extraction","semantic content analysis framework","high-level video indexing","video retrieval","event detection","multimodal content analysis","boostrapped sampling method","component network predictions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSC.2007.75","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338315/4338316/04338396.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007)","startPage":"575","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSC.2007.75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Event Extraction Using Neural Network Ensembles","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel semantic content analysis framework for reliable video event extraction which is essential for high-level video indexing and retrieval. In this work, we target to address the unique challenges posed in rare event detection, where positive examples (i.e., eventful data points) are vastly outnumbered and thus overshadowed by negative ones (i.e., noneventful data points). The proposed framework tackles this issue by integrating the strength of multimodal content analysis and neural network ensembles. Specifically, due to the rareness of the target events, the boostrapped sampling method is adopted to reduce the effect of class imbalance and a group of component neural networks are constructed consequently. Thereafter, a weighting scheme is applied to intelligently traverse and combine the component network predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated over a large collection of soccer video data with different styles produced by different broadcasters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338396/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9880228","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4338396/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Semantic Event Extraction Using Neural Network Ensembles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Event Extraction Using Neural Network Ensembles","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"29970575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051709S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338315","isNumber":"4338316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338315","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4338316","articleId":"4338396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4338461,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Teehan","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/54/4338452/4338461/4338461-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul Teehan is an MASc candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

Although most digital circuits remain synchronous, many designs feature multiple clock domains, often running at different frequencies. Using an asynchronous interconnect decouples the timing issues for the separate blocks. Systems employing such schemes are called globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS). To minimize time to market, large SoC designs must integrate many functional blocks with minimal design effort. These blocks are usually designed using standard synchronous methods and often have different clocking requirements. A GALS approach can facilitate fast block reuse by providing wrapper circuits to handle interblock communication across clock domain boundaries. SoCs may also achieve power savings by clocking different blocks at their minimum speeds. For example, Scott et al. describe the advantages of GALS design for an embedded-processor peripheral bus.","doi":"10.1109/MDT.2007.151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/4338452/04338461.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.2007.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338452","startPage":"418","endPage":"428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey and Taxonomy of GALS Design Styles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Survey and Taxonomy of GALS Design Styles","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9631561","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4338461/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey and Taxonomy of GALS Design Styles","sourcePdf":"mdt2007050418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057868S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"54","isNumber":"4338452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4338452","articleId":"4338461","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4338463,"authors":[{"name":"Milos Krstic","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/54/4338452/4338463/4338463-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Milo \u00c5\u00a1 Krsti \u00c4\u2021 is a research associate at IHP Microelectronics, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany.

It neither uses any penalty function nor distinguishes the feasible solutions and the infeasible solutions. Firstly, the constrained optimization problem is transformed into a bi-objective optimization problem. One objective is the objective function of the original nonlinear constrained optimization problem, and the other is the scalar constraints violation. Based on the dominating relation of the Pareto, a new choosing strategy is first designed, and then by combining the choosing strategy with the reasonable design of the genetic operation and different parameters, a new genetic algorithm is finally proposed. The numerical experiment shows that the algorithm is effective in dealing with the nonlinear constraint optimization problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338541","startPage":"118","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338541.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Nonlinear Constrained Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338541/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Nonlinear Constrained Optimization Problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4338541/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9880672","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Nonlinear Constrained Optimization Problems","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072646S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338502","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4338503","articleId":"4338541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4338618,"authors":[{"name":"Yongsheng Qian","affiliation":["School of Traffic and Transportation Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Qian","id":"37672819800"},{"name":"Chunlei Wang","affiliation":["School of Traffic and Transportation Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China"],"firstName":"Chunlei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715939200"},{"name":"Hailong Wang","affiliation":["School of Traffic and Transportation Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716007000"},{"name":"Zhetang Wang","affiliation":["School of Traffic and Transportation Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China"],"firstName":"Zhetang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715202900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1531-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"4338618","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Signal design","Particle swarm optimization","Traffic control","Arithmetic","Vehicles","Convergence","Control systems","Cities and towns","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","road traffic","road vehicles","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban traffic signal control","three swarms cooperative-particle swarm optimization","TSC-PSO arithmetic","average delay per vehicle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["urban traffic signal control","TSC-PSO (three swarms cooperative-particle swarm optimization)","signal timing optimization","average delay per vehicle"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338618","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338618.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","startPage":"512","endPage":"515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Optimization Design of Urban Traffic Signal Control Based on Three Swarms Cooperative-particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"TSC-PSO (three swarms cooperative-particle swarm optimization) is applied to the optimization design of urban traffic, and average delay per vehicle is regarded as performance index.

Due to PID controllers' widespread use in industry, tuning procedures for them are always a topic of interest. An evolutionary immune inspired algorithm, named Immune Genetic Algorithm (IGA), is used for tuning the controller so that closed-loop step response specifications are satisfied. Experiments with different processes indicate that the gains obtained through Immune Genetic Algorithm (IGA) may provide better responses than those obtained by the classical Ziegler-Nichols method. The PID Controller based on IGA is realized by the configuration software and Lab VIEW. The experiment results show that the water level controlled by the PID controller can response fast and reach the stable state quickly in comparison with that controlled by the conventional PID controller.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338670","startPage":"782","endPage":"786","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338670.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of Immune Genetic Algorithm in PID Parameter Optimization for Level Control System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Three-term control","Level control","Pi control","Proportional control","Control systems","Hardware","Evolutionary computation","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","genetic algorithms","level control","step response","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PID parameter optimization","water level control system","immune genetic algorithm","proportional-integral-derivative controller","evolutionary computation","closed-loop step response specification","configuration software","LabView"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PID control","Immune Genetic Algorithms (IGA)","water level control","cascade control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Application of Immune Genetic Algorithm in PID Parameter Optimization for Level Control System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4338670/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880587","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Immune Genetic Algorithm in PID Parameter Optimization for Level Control System","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052142S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338502","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4338503","articleId":"4338670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4338672,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Lui","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Shandong, Jinan, Shandong Province, China; School of Information Management, Economic University of Shandong. liuwh76@163.com"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Lui","id":"37087748111"},{"name":"Qingmei Sui","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Shandong, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Qingmei","lastName":"Sui","id":"37542685700"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Shandong, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085379581"},{"name":"Nan Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37722086000"},{"name":"Zhengmin Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Management, University of Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zhengmin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37711257300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1531-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"4338672","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338672","abstract":"A novel optimal thresholding algorithm for image segmentation based on 2-D histogram is presented in this paper.

It can get ideal segmentation results from the images with lower signal noise ratio (SNR). However, the time-consuming computation is often an obstacle for this method to be used in real time application systems. By analyzing the theory of entropy threshold segmentation, the comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) is then used to counteract premature convergence, so that we can obtain the maximum entropy.

Three failure types (system fault, sensor fault, and combined fault) are handled. Mobile robot system consists of several functional modules belonging to different module groups, which execute different tasks. According to the consistency among sensors information between the neighbor modules in the same module group, the method of fault diagnosis is studied. Then, multiple CMAC neural networks are used to implement the diagnosis. One CMAC neural network is set to one module group.

In this paper, a quarter-car dynamic model was exactly established involving mathematical models of EHA parts. Under the input conditions of the given road profile and designed fuzzy controller, active suspension was computationally simulated by MATLAB tools. To truly validate suspension, physical prototype and experimental rig for active suspension were designed and built. A mechanical cam vibration exciter was developed to generate sinusoidal road signals. As a result, the experimental tests of the fuzzy active suspension system using a quarter-car model have been completed. The computer simulation results show sprung mass acceleration for fuzzy active suspension descends by 35.5% by contrast with passive suspension. Experimental test data indicate that sprung mass acceleration for fuzzy active suspension drops by 27.38% and suspension deflection for fuzzy active suspension drops by 26.76% by contrast with passive suspension. The fuzzy control active suspension provides better ride comfort, handling and stability than passive suspension system.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338705","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338705.pdf","startPage":"959","endPage":"963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Experimental Investigation into the Design of Vehicle Fuzzy Active Suspension","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4338705/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880624","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338705/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Experimental Investigation into the Design of Vehicle Fuzzy Active Suspension","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044141S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338502","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4338503","articleId":"4338705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4338720,"authors":[{"name":"Peijin Ji","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peijin","lastName":"Ji","id":"37707088900"},{"name":"Lianwen Jin","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lianwen","lastName":"Jin","id":"37288403700"},{"name":"Xutao Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xutao","lastName":"Li","id":"37089072679"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1531-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"4338720","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338720","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gabor filters","Feature extraction","Robustness","Road vehicles","Intelligent sensors","Image sampling","Sampling methods","Intelligent transportation systems","Principal component analysis","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","feature extraction","Gabor filters","image classification","image sampling","road traffic","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-based vehicle type classification","partial Gabor filter bank","van truck","hatchback sedan","bus","Gabor features extraction","partial sampling method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicle classification","Gabor filter","ITS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338720","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338720.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-based Vehicle Type Classification Using Partial Gabor Filter Bank","abstract":"A vision-based vehicle type classification method using partial Gabor filter bank is present in this paper for five vehicles categorization: sedan, van, hatchback sedan, bus and van truck.

According to the characteristics of electric short-term load forecasting, a complementation method based on fuzzy-rough set theory and BP NN is proposed to deal with this problem in the paper. First of all, we extract the input characteristic to make the initial decision table. Secondly, in order to reduce the information losing, fuzzing up the attribute values instead of discretizing them. Finally, reduce the input parameters of ANN by using the knowledge of the fuzzy-rough set theory. In this paper, through reduction, the author just selects several parameters which are most relative to the forecasting variable to be the rational ANN input. This method takes the weather, temperature, day type .etc into account. And in the same time, it can avoid the problems which are occurred because of overfull input parameters. The testing results on a real power system show that the proposed model is feasible.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338784","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338784.pdf","startPage":"1373","endPage":"1377","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Model For Power System Based on Complementation of Fuzzy-Rough Set Theory And BP Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Model For Power System Based on Complementation of Fuzzy-Rough Set Theory And BP Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9880712","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4338784/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Model For Power System Based on Complementation of Fuzzy-Rough Set Theory And BP Neural Network","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059877S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338502","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4338503","articleId":"4338784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4338789,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37715806600"},{"name":"Shengxian Zhuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shengxian","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37330527800"},{"name":"Luan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Luan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37716077100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1531-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"4338789","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servomechanisms","Sliding mode control","Magnetic variables control","Permanent magnet motors","Machine vector control","Regulators","Space vector pulse width modulation","Position control","Hardware","Embedded software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","permanent magnet motors","position control","servomechanisms","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based servo controller","permanent magnet synchronous motor drive","current loop control","speed loop control","vector control strategy","position control","nios embedded processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","sliding mode","vector control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338789","abstract":"An FPGA-Based servo controller for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive is designed and realized in this paper.

The objective of this paper is to propose a novel pixel-level multisensor image fusion algorithm combining intensity-hue- saturation (IHS) transformation and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). A new fusion rule based on local energy feature and local average gradient feature is developed for appropriately combining the wavelet detail coefficients of the intensity component and the original high spatial resolution image with an operation of amplification on the wavelet detail coefficients of the original high spatial resolution image. The proposed method was compared visually and qualitatively with existing standard IHS transformation and standard DWT strategies. Experimental results presented on a set of multispectral (MS) images and a Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Panchromatic (PAN) image of the same scene indicate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively with respect to those methods in preserving spectral information and improving spatial resolution for the test images.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338890","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338890.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Image Fusion Algorithm Based on IHS and Discrete Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Image Fusion Algorithm Based on IHS and Discrete Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4338890/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880830","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4338890/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Image Fusion Algorithm Based on IHS and Discrete Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106999S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338502","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4338503","articleId":"4338890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4338892,"authors":[{"name":"Yugui Yang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yugui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37716461200"},{"name":"Guangzheng Peng","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangzheng","lastName":"Peng","id":"37406361600"},{"name":"Yifeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37717219700"},{"name":"Hongli Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongli","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37716653100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1531-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"4338892","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":495},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4338892","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","Genetic algorithms","Manipulator dynamics","Humanoid robots","Equations","Least squares methods","Partial response channels","Matrices","Automation","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","manipulator kinematics","redundant manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse kinematics","7-degree of freedom manipulator","genetic algorithm","weighted least square method","global optimum solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse kinematics","GA","Redundant manipulator","Joint compliance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338892","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04338892.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","startPage":"1947","endPage":"1951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4338892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Solution for Inverse Kinematics of 7-DOF Manipulator Based on Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"For dealing with the complexity in gaining solution for inverse kinematics of 7-DOF manipulator, a new approach based on GA (genetic algorithm) is proposed.

The neural velocity estimators used to map input voltage and current to the estimated PMSM angular velocity. The angle estimation block generates rotor angle by integrating the estimated angular velocity, with adjustment derived from the current estimation error.Through experimentation, 12 neurons in the hidden recurrent layer were found to produce good results for the neural current observer.

The control result of CPG is decided by the gait data of the quadruped and the parameters of the CPG are choosing manually. Modeling a quadruped robot is difficult because it is a high nonlinear system. This paper presents a much simpler method for the control of a quadruped robot. A simple CPG is adopted for a timing oscillator; it generates the motion periodic pattern of legs.

Determination of the production sequence for different models is a key issue in the mixed model assembly line. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a novel metaheuristic inspired by the flocking behaviour of birds which has be used in consecutive problems successfully. However, it's applications in the mixed model assembly line sequencing are extremely few. This paper attempts to use a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the mixed model assembly line sequencing problem in discrete space with two objectives: the total setup cost and total idle-overload cost. Compared with the original PSO, we modified the particle position representation and adapted it to the discrete code, and introduced a self-adaptive escape scheme to enhance the diversity of particles. A comparison between the basic PSO and our modified PSO show that our modified PSO algorithm is an effective sequencing method for mixed model assembly lines which possesses rich diversity.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339061","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04339061.pdf","startPage":"2818","endPage":"2823","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequencing Mixed Model Assembly Lines Based on a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization Multi-objective Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sequencing Mixed Model Assembly Lines Based on a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization Multi-objective Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9881017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339061/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequencing Mixed Model Assembly Lines Based on a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization Multi-objective Algorithm","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06997S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338502","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4338503","articleId":"4339061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339064,"authors":[{"name":"Jingmin Wang","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Jingmin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599859500"},{"name":"Yamin Zhou","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Yamin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37710624800"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Chen","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37694172000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1531-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"4339064","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Support vector machines","Predictive models","Simulated annealing","Particle swarm optimization","Power system modeling","Expert systems","Artificial neural networks","Production","Hybrid intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","particle swarm optimisation","power engineering computing","simulated annealing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity load forecasting","support vector machine","simulated annealing","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electricity short-term load forecasting","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Simulated Annealing Algorithms (SA)","Support vector machine (SVM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339064","abstract":"Short-term electricity load forecasting is a difficult work as the load at a given point is dependent not only on the load at the previous hour but also on the load at the same hour on the previous day, and on the load at the same hour on the day with the same denomination in the previous week. So the accuracy of forecasting is influenced by many unpredicted factors. Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel type of learning machine, which has been successfully employed to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. In this paper, it is proposed a new optimal model, which is based on Stimulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (SAPSO) that combines the advantages of PSO algorithm and SA algorithm. The new algorithm is employed to choose the parameters of a SVM model. The model is proved to be able to enhance the accuracy and improved the convergence ability and reduced operation time by numerical experiment. Subsequently, examples of electricity load data from a city in China are used to illustrate the proposed SAPSO-SVM. The empirical results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the other models. Consequently, the SAPSO-SVM model provides a promising alternative for forecasting electricity load.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339064","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04339064.pdf","startPage":"2836","endPage":"2841","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electricity Load Forecasting Based on Support Vector Machines and Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Electricity Load Forecasting Based on Support Vector Machines and Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9881020","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339064/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electricity Load Forecasting Based on Support Vector Machines and Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059268S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4338502","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4338503","articleId":"4339064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4339108,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Min","affiliation":["The School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Ji''nan, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Min","id":"37528652300"},{"name":"Zhang Yong","affiliation":["The School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Ji''nan, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yong","id":"37606003100"},{"name":"Wang Zhonghua","affiliation":["The School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Ji''nan, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Zhonghua","id":"37546270600"},{"name":"Fang Hui","affiliation":["The School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Ji''nan, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Hui","id":"37718026400"},{"name":"Wang Qianhong","affiliation":["The School of Control Science and Engineering, University of Ji''nan, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Qianhong","id":"37604393500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1530-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1531-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"}],"articleNumber":"4339108","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Control systems","Hydraulic actuators","Nonlinear control systems","Robust stability","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","compensation","induction motors","Lyapunov methods","machine control","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saturation compensation control","induction motor systems","adaptive neural networks","Lyapunov theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["saturation compensation","neural network control","Induction motor","adaptive control"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation Compensation Control of Induction Motors Using Adaptive Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339108","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339108","startPage":"3065","endPage":"3069","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04339108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new adaptive technique of induction motors systems with unknown saturation.

In the past decades, Genetic algorithms have demonstrated considerable success in providing efficient solutions to many NP-hard optimization problems. But there is no literature considering the optimal parameters when designing genetic algorithms. Unsuitable parameters may cause terrible solution for a specific scheduling problem. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage genetic algorithm, which attempts to firstly find the fittest control parameters, namely, number of population, probability of crossover, probability of mutation, for a given job shop problem with a fraction of time; and then the fittest parameters are used in the genetic algorithm for further more search operation to find optimal solution. For large-size problem, the two-stage genetic algorithm can get optimal solution effectively and efficiently. The method is validated based on some hard benchmark problems of job shop scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339111","pdfPath":"/iel5/4338502/4338503/04339111.pdf","startPage":"3078","endPage":"3083","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2007.4339111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4338503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Stage Genetic Algorithm for Large-Size Scheduling Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Genetic Algorithm for Large-Size Scheduling Problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9881071","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339111/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Genetic Algorithm for Large-Size Scheduling Problem","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"ICAL-00-608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037551S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2007","isNumber":"4338503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4338502","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4339111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4339156,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Microsystems are mixed-signal systems having one or more sensors, analog conditioning stages and a digital subsystem. The integration of such a complex unit posses formidable problems particularly to the analog subsystem, owing to the large dispersion of the electrical characteristics found in present organic devices. Furthermore, OFET-based analog circuit design is constrained by the existence of proper device models, owing to the fact that organic transistors posses certain features not adequately portrayed by traditional FET-Models. For this purpose a novel transistor model was implemented, involving such aspects as technology variability and non-ideal organic transistor behaviour. A number of analog blocks were designed and tested, these made up the fundament to build more complex circuits, like operational amplifiers, analog-digital-converters and high-gain amplifiers. In the present paper some fundamental analog blocks and their characterization, the transistor model employed and complex circuits, like high-gain amplifiers with stable feedback characteristics (simulated gain 50 dB with a bandwidth of 700 Hz and a phase margin of 70deg), a 4-bit charge-redistribution analog-digital converter, and others are shown. Working cascode, differential amplifiers and differential-to-single ended converters, among other circuits, featuring unity-gain bandwidths of over 1.4 kHz with nominal DC-gains of 10 dB are demonstrated. Simulation and measurement at DC and high-frequency show very good agreement (all measurements fall within the 80% confidence interval predicted by our models), indicating the good quality of the transistor model employed.

The search space of possible task schedules for this problem is immense. One possible approach for this optimization problem, which is NP-hard, is to start with the best task schedule found by a fast deterministic task scheduling algorithm and then iteratively attempt to improve the task schedule by employing a general random guided search method. However, such an approach can lead to extremely long search times, and the solutions found are sometimes not significantly better than those found by the original deterministic task scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy, termed Push-Pull, which starts with the best task schedule found by a fast deterministic task scheduling algorithm and then iteratively attempts to improve the current best solution using a deterministic guided search method. Our simulation results show that given similar runtimes, the Push-Pull algorithm performs well, achieving results similar to or better than all of the other algorithms being compared.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1106","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4339191/04339194.pdf","startPage":"1489","endPage":"1502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Push-Pull: Deterministic Search-Based DAG Scheduling for Heterogeneous Cluster Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Push-Pull: Deterministic Search-Based DAG Scheduling for Heterogeneous Cluster Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9658154","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339194/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Push-Pull: Deterministic Search-Based DAG Scheduling for Heterogeneous Cluster Systems","sourcePdf":"l1489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087063S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4339191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4339191","articleId":"4339194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4339199,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Sonnek","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, University of Minnesota, Lino Lakes, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4339191/4339199/4339199-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jason Sonnek received the MS degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota in May 2005 and the BS degree in computer science and mathematics from the University of Minnesota, Duluth, in 2003.

We present adaptive scheduling techniques that can mitigate this uncertainty and significantly outperform current approaches. In this work, we consider nodes that execute tasks via donated computational resources and may behave erratically or maliciously. We present a model in which reliability is not a binary property, but a statistical one based on a node's prior performance and behavior. We use this model to construct several reputation-based scheduling algorithms that employ estimated reliability ratings of worker nodes for efficient task allocation. Our scheduling algorithms are designed to adapt to changing system conditions, as well as nonstationary node reliability. Through simulation, we demonstrate that our algorithms can significantly improve throughput while maintaining a very high success rate of task completion. Our results suggest that reputation-based scheduling can handle a wide variety of worker populations, including nonstationary behavior, with overhead that scales well with system size. We also show that our adaptation mechanism allows the application designer fine-grain control over the desired performance metrics.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4339191/04339199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339191","startPage":"1551","endPage":"1564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Reputation-Based Scheduling on Unreliable Distributed Infrastructures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Reputation-Based Scheduling on Unreliable Distributed Infrastructures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9706033","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339199/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Reputation-Based Scheduling on Unreliable Distributed Infrastructures","sourcePdf":"l1551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107645S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4339191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4339191","articleId":"4339199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339201,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Saman Tosun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Technology, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4339191/4339201/4339201-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali \u015eaman Tosun received the BS degree in computer engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1995 and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.

In this paper, we analyze the proposed schemes, tune some of the parameters, and compare them for different query types and under different loads. We propose a three-step retrieval algorithm for the compared schemes. For arbitrary queries, the dependent and partitioned allocation schemes perform poorly; others perform close to each other. For range queries, they perform similarly with the exception of smaller queries in which random duplicate allocation (RDA) performs poorly and dependent allocation performs well. For connected queries, partitioned allocation performs poorly and dependent allocation performs well under a light load.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4339191/04339201.pdf","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Comparison of Replicated Declustering Schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339201/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Comparison of Replicated Declustering Schemes","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9658156","htmlLink":"/document/4339201/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Comparison of Replicated Declustering Schemes","sourcePdf":"l1578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131516S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4339191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4339191","articleId":"4339201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339230,"authors":[{"name":"Beat Fluri","affiliation":["Department of Informatics University of Zurich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Beat","lastName":"Fluri","id":"37550131400"},{"name":"Michael Wursch","affiliation":["Univ. of Zurich, Zurich"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wursch","id":"37704155100"},{"name":"Martin PInzger","affiliation":["Department of Informatics University of Zurich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"PInzger","id":"37265107400"},{"name":"Harald Gall","affiliation":["Department of Informatics University of Zurich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Gall","id":"37266441700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-5589"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3520"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3881"}],"articleNumber":"4339230","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":291,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":3766},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"A key issue in software evolution analysis is the identification of particular changes that occur across several versions of a program. We present change distilling, a tree differencing algorithm for fine-grained source code change extraction. For that, we have improved the existing algorithm by Chawathe et al. for extracting changes in hierarchically structured data. Our algorithm extracts changes by finding both a match between the nodes of the compared two abstract syntax trees and a minimum edit script that can transform one tree into the other given the computed matching. As a result, we can identify fine-grained change types between program versions according to our taxonomy of source code changes. We evaluated our change distilling algorithm with a benchmark that we developed, which consists of 1,064 manually classified changes in 219 revisions of eight methods from three different open source projects. We achieved significant improvements in extracting types of source code changes: Our algorithm approximates the minimum edit script 45 percent better than the original change extraction approach by Chawathe et al. We are able to find all occurring changes and almost reach the minimum conforming edit script, that is, we reach a mean absolute percentage error of 34 percent, compared to the 79 percent reached by the original algorithm. The paper describes both our change distilling algorithm and the results of our evolution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/4339227/04339230.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2007.70731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2007.70731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Change Distilling:Tree Differencing for Fine-Grained Source Code Change Extraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Taxonomy","Software maintenance","Programming profession","Software algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Software tools","Maintenance engineering","Software systems","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software maintenance","software prototyping","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum edit script","abstract syntax trees","software evolution analysis","fine-grained source code change extraction","change distilling tree differencing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Source code change extraction","tree differencing algorithms","software repositories","software evolution analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Change Distilling:Tree Differencing for Fine-Grained Source Code Change Extraction","volume":"33","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4339230/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9658145","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Change Distilling:Tree Differencing for Fine-Grained Source Code Change Extraction","sourcePdf":"e0725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037687S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"4339227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"291","articleId":"4339230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339272,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Voelter","affiliation":["Independent Consultant, Heidenheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Voelter","id":"37691839200"},{"name":"Iris Groher","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Iris","lastName":"Groher","id":"37313019500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2888-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2888-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4339272","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1350},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","DSL","Concrete","Portfolios","Software development management","Software maintenance","Home automation","Iris","Costs","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented programming","software development management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software product line engineering","aspect-oriented software development","model-driven software development","aspect-oriented composition techniques","model transformations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339272","doi":"10.1109/SPLINE.2007.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPLINE.2007.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339240","publicationTitle":"11th International Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"11th International Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339239/4339240/04339272.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Product Line Implementation using Aspect-Oriented and Model-Driven Software Development","abstract":"Software product line engineering aims to reduce development time, effort, cost, and complexity by taking advantage of the commonality within a portfolio of similar products.

In OOK, the bandwidth requirement is roughly equivalent to the data rate (R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n,). PPM achieves higher average power efficiency than OOK at the expense of an increased bandwidth (x4) compared to OOK. Besides, the use of PPM imposes more system complexity compared to OOK since both slot- and symbol-level synchronizations, critical to system performance, are required at the receiver. Unlike PPM, DPIM does not require symbol synchronization since each symbol is initiated with a pulse. Furthermore, DPIM displays a higher transmission capacity by eliminating all the unused time slots from within each symbol. In terms of BER, 4-DPIM displays a performance in between that of OOK and PPM. It is concluded that DPIM is the most efficient scheme in terms of transmission capacity and band-width requirements.

This LNA exploits a positive feedback capacitor connected to a conventional cascaded inductive source degenerated LNA whereby the connection of a capacitor determines the operating frequency of the LNA. For operation at 1.8 GHz DECT, the capacitor is feedback to both transistors of the cascaded LNA and as for 2.4 GHz WLAN application, the capacitor is feedback to only one of the transistors. Two switches are employed to control the connection of the feedback capacitor to the LNA. By switching the connection of the feedback capacitor, the narrow-band gain and impedance matching are achieved at both 1.8 GHz and 2.4 GHz frequency bands. The LNA has been simulated using 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology and results attained for both two bands are as followed; gain, S21 = 21 dB, noise figure, NF = 0.8 dB and linearity with third-order intercept point, IIP3 =- 0.13 dBm.

The objective of this paper were to investigate the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) for predicting the ambient air quality for air quality monitoring in states of Malaysia. The measurement activities are carried at Jalan Tasek in Perak, Nilai in Negeri Sembilan and Jerantut in Pahang. The data collected comprises of data for the previous two months, beginning from November 2004. The ambient air quality plays an important role in evaluating the air quality. The artificial neural network simplifies and speeds up the computation of the ambient air quality, as compared to the currently existing method. For this purposes, neural network model provides an interesting alternative to air quality monitoring. The comparison between data from model predictions and actual observations is coherent which shows that promising result based on the developed ANN model in predicting Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) is effective and accurate.","doi":"10.1109/SCORED.2006.4339321","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339287/4339288/04339321.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 4th Student Conference on Research and Development","publicationTitle":"2006 4th Student Conference on Research and Development","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCORED.2006.4339321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Ambient Air Quality Based on Neural Network Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Ambient Air Quality Based on Neural Network Technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"10182344","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4339321/","conferenceDate":"27-28 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Ambient Air Quality Based on Neural Network Technique","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SCORED-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045653S","chronDate":"27-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4339287","isNumber":"4339288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339287","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4339288","articleId":"4339321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4339324,"authors":[{"name":"Khairul Anuar Ishak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic & System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Khairul Anuar","lastName":"Ishak","id":"37400915400"},{"name":"Maizura Mohd Sani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic & System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Maizura Mohd","lastName":"Sani","id":"37400918900"},{"name":"Nooritawati Md Tahir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic & System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nooritawati Md","lastName":"Tahir","id":"37315644200"},{"name":"Salina Abdul Samad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic & System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Salina Abdul","lastName":"Samad","id":"37294302600"},{"name":"Aini Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic & System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Aini","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37269005600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0526-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0527-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4339324","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":330},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339324","abstract":"This paper presents a real-time system to detect speed limit signs and remind drivers about the allowable speed limit in a specific road.

This paper presents an overview of autonomous mobile robot path planning focusing on algorithms that produce an optimal path for a robot to navigate in an environment. To complete the navigation task, the algorithms will read the map of the environment or workspace and subsequently attempts to create free paths for the robot to traverse in the workspace without colliding with objects and obstacles. Appropriate or correct and suitable algorithms will fulfill its function fast enough, that is, to find an optimal path for the robot to traverse in, even if there are a large number of obstacles cluttered in a complex environment. To achieve this, various approaches in the design of algorithms used to develop an ideal path planning system for autonomous mobile robots have been proposed by many researchers. Simulation and experimental results from previous research shows that algorithms play an important role to produce an optimal path (short, smooth and robust) for autonomous robot navigation and simultaneously it prove that appropriate algorithms can run fast enough to be used practically without time-consuming problem. This paper presents an overview and discusses the strength and weakness of path planning algorithms developed and used by previous and current researchers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 June 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4339335/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"10182302","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Autonomous Mobile Robot Path Planning Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview of Autonomous Mobile Robot Path Planning Algorithms","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SCORED-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045309S","chronDate":"27-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4339287","isNumber":"4339288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339287","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4339288","articleId":"4339335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4339371,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppa Alfano","affiliation":["CRdC-ICT-Universit\u00e1 del Sannio, Benevento, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppa","lastName":"Alfano","id":"37269912400"},{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Maio","id":"37272858900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1275-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1276-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-4652"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-4660"}],"articleNumber":"4339371","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"abstract":"A statistical model for land mobile satellite (LMS) channels, where transmitters and receivers are equipped with multiple antennas, is introduced. In addition to the probability density function (pdf) of the channel matrix grammian, spectral statistics are given. They allow the theoretical performance analysis of the newly proposed channel model from both a communication and an information-theoretic point of view. More specifically, relying on recent results on finite-dimensional random matrix theory, the statistics of an unordered eigenvalue and of the maximum eigenvalue of the channel matrix grammian are evaluated in closed form. The eigenanalysis paves the way for the calculus of the outage probability for adaptive transmission strategies. Moreover, it permits the computation of the ergodic mutual information in the coherent case. The results are illustrated through several examples, aimed at assessing the impact on the performance of the diversity order and/or the line-of-sight (LOS) fluctuations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339354/4339355/04339371.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","doi":"10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theoretical framework for LMS MIMO communication systems performance analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","MIMO","Communication systems","Performance analysis","Statistics","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Satellites","Transmitters","Mobile antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","land mobile radio","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","probability","receiving antennas","satellite communication","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile satellite channels","LMS MIMO communication systems","statistical model","multiple antennas","probability density function","channel matrix grammian","spectral statistics","finite-dimensional random matrix theory","eigenvalue analysis","outage probability","adaptive transmission","line-of-sight fluctuation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical framework for LMS MIMO communication systems performance analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9795472","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical framework for LMS MIMO communication systems performance analysis","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056641S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339378,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

In this article we propose a novel wavelet packet based approach to address the issue of interference mitigation from wideband co-existing services such as the WLAN standard IEEE 802.11a on UWB communication. By representing the UWB transmission waveform as wavelet packet coefficients and by selectively removing those coefficients whose spectral footprint lie in or close to the interference zones, the effect of interference on the UWB system is mitigated. Special emphasis is given to the design of maximally frequency selective filter banks derived from a modified Remez exchange algorithm. The proposed interference mitigation is shown to be effective with a much improved bit error rate (BER) performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9795479","htmlLink":"/document/4339378/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of interference from wideband IEEE 802.11a source on UWB wireless communication using frequency selective wavelet packets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of interference from wideband IEEE 802.11a source on UWB wireless communication using frequency selective wavelet packets","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039311S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339380,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Giannetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Giannetti","id":"37271966100"},{"name":"Vincenzo Lottici","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Lottici","id":"37271164300"},{"name":"Ivan Stupia","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Stupia","id":"37591299100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1275-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1276-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-4652"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-4660"}],"articleNumber":"4339380","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio","multi-carrier code division multiple access","spreading signature codes","mobile communication","channel coding"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution we demonstrate that the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of a multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) signal can be suitably minimized by resorting to a judicious strategy for the allocation of the spreading signature codes.

Cognitive radio (CR) and ultra wide band (UWB) technologies have been proposed as candidates to address this problem. Currently, a CR determines unused frequency bands and transmits overlay waveforms in these bands, while UWB transmits underlay waveforms that span the entire frequency band while coexisting with primary users. This suggests that most of the spectrum occupied by primary users is underused. This work proposes a general soft decision cognitive radio (SDCR) framework, based on a previous developed spectrally modulated, spectrally modulated (SMSE) framework, to combine benefits of overlay/underlay techniques while maximizing channel capacity. We also show that current CR and UWB implementations represent two extreme SDCR cases and that current overlay/underlay waveforms are two special cases of the general waveform platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339382/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339382/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9795483","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A general overlay/underlay analytic expression representing cognitive radio waveform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general overlay/underlay analytic expression representing cognitive radio waveform","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062782S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339385,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin M.

According to the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion, we derive the optimum blind estimator for a QAM transmission as well as for a circularly symmetric Gaussian one and, therefore, we evaluate, by means of computer simulations, their performances in terms of mean square estimation error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML estimation of receiver IQ imbalance parameters","publicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","doi":"10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339401","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339354/4339355/04339401.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"ML estimation of receiver IQ imbalance parameters","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339401/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9795502","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML estimation of receiver IQ imbalance parameters","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042567S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339402,"authors":[{"name":"Maddalena Lipardi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Maddalena","lastName":"Lipardi","id":"37706490300"},{"name":"Davide Mattera","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Mattera","id":"37428688400"},{"name":"Fabio Sterle","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Sterle","id":"37428695000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1275-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1276-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-4652"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-4660"}],"articleNumber":"4339402","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339402","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Equalizers","CMOS technology","Nonlinear filters","Error analysis","Fabrication","Frequency conversion","Signal processing","Telecommunications","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","dispersive channels","equalisers","filtering theory","least mean squares methods","receivers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE equalization","transmitter","receiver","IQ imbalance","single-carrier time-dispersive noisy channel","linear filtering","minimum mean square error linear equalizer","symbol error rate","computational complexity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339355","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","publicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","doi":"10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE equalization in presence of transmitter and receiver IQ imbalance","startPage":"165","endPage":"168","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339354/4339355/04339402.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339402","abstract":"The wide spread of low-cost fabrication technologies gives rise to unpredictable imperfections associated with the analog stages which perform the frequency conversion.

The conventional analog and digital modulation schemes that are based on the use of sinusoidal carrier waveforms are applied to nonsinusoidal impulse waveforms. As illustrative examples, M-ary impulse modulation schemes are described, i.e., M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) and M-ary frequency shift keying (M-FSK). The design of a linear FM \"chirp\" impulse waveform for radar applications is presented too.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9795523","htmlLink":"/document/4339422/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Waveform design and modulation schemes for impulse communications and radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform design and modulation schemes for impulse communications and radar","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031047S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4339423,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.

As recently proposed, the SMSE framework supports cognition-based, software defined radio (SDR) applications and is well-suited for coexistence analysis. For initial proof-of-concept, two SMSE waveform parameters (number of carriers and carrier bandwidth) are optimized in a coexistent scenario to characterize SMSE impact on Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) bit error performance. Given optimization via GA techniques have been successfully applied in many engineering fields, as well as operations research, they are viable candidates for robust SMSE waveform design. As demonstrated, the analytic SMSE framework is well-suited for parametric optimization via GA techniques.","doi":"10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339423","startPage":"265","endPage":"269","publicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339355","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339354/4339355/04339423.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using genetic algorithms for Spectrally Modulated Spectrally Encoded waveform design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339423/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using genetic algorithms for Spectrally Modulated Spectrally Encoded waveform design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339423/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9795524","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using genetic algorithms for Spectrally Modulated Spectrally Encoded waveform design","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061619S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4339424,"authors":[{"name":"David A.

A general framework is presented based on generalized transmitter and receiver basis functions, which allow to jointly carry out dynamic resource allocation (DRA) and waveform adaptation, two procedures that are traditionally carried out separately. New objective function and cognitive spectral mask constraints are formulated for DRA optimization tailored to CR applications. The joint DRA and waveform adaptation approach permits distributed games in multiple access networks, in which participating CR users optimize their respective local utility functions by taking actions from the action space defined by allowable basis function parameters. It results in not only enhanced radio spectrum resource efficiency due to joint optimization, but also affordable complexity scalable in the network size, by virtue of the distributed game approach adopted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9795537","htmlLink":"/document/4339436/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Frequency agile waveform adaptation for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency agile waveform adaptation for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037056S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339440,"authors":[{"name":"Douglas A.

Increased measurement accuracy results in enhanced tracking performance. In this paper, we apply sequential Monte Carlo methods to propose matched filtering operations in the delay-Doppler space where a target is expected to exist. Moreover, in the case of thresholding the measurements, these methods are used to form resolution cells that have the shape of the probability of detection contour. These methods offer an advantage over traditional radar tracking methods that form tessellating resolution cells to approximate the probability of detection contours, and exhaustively perform matched filtering operations over the entire delay-Doppler space. With the use of a Bjorck constant amplitude zero-autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequence, a high resolution measurement is attained and the use of thresholding is avoided. This is an advantage over commonly used waveforms such as linear frequency modulated chirps (LFMs). We examine the properties of Bjorck CAZACs and demonstrate improved tracking performance over LFMs in a single target tracking scenario.","doi":"10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339445","publicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339354/4339355/04339445.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339355","startPage":"367","endPage":"371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target tracking using particle filtering and CAZAC sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Target tracking using particle filtering and CAZAC sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339445/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9795546","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339445/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target tracking using particle filtering and CAZAC sequences","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095943S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339454,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon J.

Several practical limitations need to be considered in such a design. One issue is that many HF radar transmit arrays are over-sampled spatially to allow for operation over a significant portion of the HF band. Transmission of orthogonal waveforms in this case can result in large reactive power and consequent equipment damage. Another issue is the ability to generate orthogonal waveform sets with sufficient cardinality at the low time-bandwidth products typical of aircraft surveillance operation. There are likely to be fewer waveforms than transmit elements and so some form of spatial rank expansion, from waveform to radiated signal, is required. Both of these issues are examined using Maric-Titlebaum frequency-hop codes as one example of an orthogonal waveform set.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal waveform support in MIMO HF OTH radars","publicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","doi":"10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339454","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339354/4339355/04339454.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal waveform support in MIMO HF OTH radars","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339454/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9795555","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal waveform support in MIMO HF OTH radars","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036972S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339456,"authors":[{"name":"Martina Gabele","affiliation":["Satellite SAR Systems Section, Germany AeroSpace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Martina","lastName":"Gabele","id":"37400297200"},{"name":"Ishuwa Sikaneta","affiliation":["Radar Systems Section, Defence Research and Development Canada, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ishuwa","lastName":"Sikaneta","id":"37268691200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1275-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1276-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-4652"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-4660"}],"articleNumber":"4339456","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Azimuth","Parameter estimation","Receiving antennas","Phase estimation","Transmitting antennas","Radar antennas","Synthetic aperture radar","Diversity reception","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","radar antennas","radar clutter","radar interferometry","radar target recognition","radar tracking","synthetic aperture radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual antenna","two-channel SAR-GMTI system","moving target motion parameter estimation","ATI phase estimate","clutter ratio","target across-track velocity","antenna diversity","aperture switching","RADARSAT-2 Toggle","DPCA-ATI processing algorithm","along-track interferometry","ground moving target indication"]}],"abstract":"Two-channel SAR-GMTI systems are suboptimal for moving target motion parameter estimation. Indeed, the ATI phase estimate of the across-track velocity component for a moving target is biased to lower values depending on the target signal to clutter ratio and the target across-track velocity. Additional antenna diversity can introduce additional degrees of freedom that can eliminate the bias problem. Aperture switching is an accepted method to virtually increase the number of channels without adding new hardware. One such mode is the RADARSAT-2 toggle mode (S. Chiu and C. Gierull, 2006). This paper proposes a new processing method to create a similar effective phase center configuration as the RADARSAT-2 Toggle mode from already recorded two-channel SAR data. This is achieved by delaying and combining the recorded two-channel measurements. The combination operation manifests not only a third phase center halfway between the phase centers of the two-channel system, but also a different antenna length of the virtual third antenna which requires a modification of the DPCA-ATI processing algorithm. The DPCA-ATI performance of the new mode is assessed and compared to ATI from the original two-channel mode.","doi":"10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339456","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339354/4339355/04339456.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WDDC.2007.4339456","publicationTitle":"2007 International Waveform Diversity and Design Conference","startPage":"433","endPage":"437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method to create a virtual third antenna from a two-channel SAR-GMTI system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A new method to create a virtual third antenna from a two-channel SAR-GMTI system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339456/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339456/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9795557","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method to create a virtual third antenna from a two-channel SAR-GMTI system","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-09272007-0101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064635S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339354","isNumber":"4339355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339354","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4339355","articleId":"4339456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4339465,"authors":[{"name":"Hidenori Akiyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kurokami, Kumamoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/4339462/4339465/4339465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hidenori Akiyama (M'87-SM'99-F'00) received the Ph.D. degree from Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan, in 1979.

The dielectric and discharge behavior of the polymer films were investigated. The results reveal that there are strong frequency dispersions in both the dielectric and discharge behavior. The dielectric constant decreases with frequency and the discharged energy density is also reduced at shorted discharge time (~1 mus) due to increased ESR for fast discharge. The results indicate the potential of this class of polymers for high energy density capacitors and suggest the need for further tuning of the polymer compositions to reduce the frequency dispersion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4339462/04339472.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2007.4339472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2007.4339472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Energy Density and Discharge Characteristics of a Poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene)Copolymer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polymer films","Capacitors","Electric breakdown","Frequency","Dielectric constant","Paramagnetic resonance","Immune system","Electric resistance","Testing","Powders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric polarisation","dielectric thin films","electrostatic discharge","permittivity","polymer blends","polymer films","power capacitors","thin film capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical energy density","polyvinylidene fluoride based polymer","copolymer film capacitor","frequency dispersion","dielectric constant","discharge characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Energy Density and Discharge Characteristics of a Poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene)Copolymer","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4339472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2007","accessionNumber":"9631574","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical Energy Density and Discharge Characteristics of a Poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene)Copolymer","sourcePdf":"p1133-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059692S","chronDate":"October  2007","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4339462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4339462","articleId":"4339472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339479,"authors":[{"name":"Xingliang Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Voltage and Electrical New Technology of Ministry of Education College of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/4339462/4339479/4339479-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xingliang Jiang was born in Hunan province, China, on 31 July 1961.

Thus, the composite insulators have certain advantages in severe pollution regions. The best ratio of the leakage distance to the arcing distance is about 3.35.

We conduct an analysis of our method, predicting an improvement in task efficiency compared to a purely reactive process. We then present results from a study involving untrained human subjects working with a simulated version of a robot using our system. We show a significant improvement in best-case task efficiency when compared to a group of users working with a reactive agent, as well as a significant difference in the perceived commitment of the robot to the team and its contribution to the team's fluency and success.

Its key component is a new control technique for full-body balancing in the presence of external forces, which is presented and then validated empirically. We have adopted an integrated system approach to develop humanoid robots. Herein, we describe the importance of replicating human-like capabilities and responses during human-robot interaction in this context. Our balancing controller provides gravity compensation, making the robot passive and thereby facilitating safe physical interactions. The method operates by setting an appropriate ground reaction force and transforming these forces into full-body joint torques. It handles an arbitrary number of force interaction points on the robot. It does not require force measurement at interested contact points. It requires neither inverse kinematics nor inverse dynamics. It can adapt to uneven ground surfaces. It operates as a force control process, and can therefore, accommodate simultaneous control processes using force-, velocity-, or position-based control. Forces are distributed over supporting contact points in an optimal manner. Joint redundancy is resolved by damping injection in the context of passivity. We present various force interaction experiments using our full-sized bipedal humanoid platform, including compliant balance, even when affected by unknown external forces, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Body Compliant Human\u2013Humanoid Interaction: Balancing in the Presence of Unknown External Forces","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.904896","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4339520/04339533.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.904896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Full-Body Compliant Human\u2013Humanoid Interaction: Balancing in the Presence of Unknown External Forces","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4339533/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9630183","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Body Compliant Human\u2013Humanoid Interaction: Balancing in the Presence of Unknown External Forces","sourcePdf":"23tro05-hyon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072914S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4339520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"241","xplore-issue":"4339520","articleId":"4339533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4339537,"authors":[{"name":"Dana Kulic","affiliation":["Nakamura and Yamane Laboratory, Department of Mechano-Informatics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4339520/4339537/4339537-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dana Kuli\u0107 (M'98) received the combined B.A.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees in electromechanical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 1998 and 2005, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Nakamura-Yamane Laboratory, Department of Mechano-Informatics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

This secondary mode of interactive communication is hypothesized to permit a more natural collaboration, similar to the \"body language\" interaction between two cooperating humans. This paper describes the implementation and validation of a hidden Markov model (HMM) for estimating human affective state in real time, using robot motions as the stimulus. Inputs to the system are physiological signals such as heart rate, perspiration rate, and facial muscle contraction. Affective state was estimated using a two- dimensional valence-arousal representation. A robot manipulator was used to generate motions expected during human-robot interaction, and human subjects were asked to report their response to these motions. The human physiological response was also measured. Robot motions were generated using both a nominal potential field planner and a recently reported safe motion planner that minimizes the potential collision forces along the path. The robot motions were tested with 36 subjects. This data was used to train and validate the HMM model. The results of the HMM affective estimation are also compared to a previously implemented fuzzy inference engine.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.904899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.904899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4339520/04339537.pdf","startPage":"991","endPage":"1000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Affective State Estimation for Human\u2013Robot Interaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Affective State Estimation for Human\u2013Robot Interaction","volume":"23","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9630186","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339537/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affective State Estimation for Human\u2013Robot Interaction","sourcePdf":"23tro05-kulic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072859S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4339520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"4339520","articleId":"4339537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339541,"authors":[{"name":"Curtis W.

Previous reports on using remote mobile robots suggest that navigation is difficult due to poor situation awareness. It has been recommended by experts in human-robot interaction that interfaces between humans and robots provide more spatial information and better situational context in order to improve an operator's situation awareness. This paper presents an ecological interface paradigm that combines video, map, and robot-pose information into a 3-D mixed-reality display. The ecological paradigm is validated in planar worlds by comparing it against the standard interface paradigm in a series of simulated and real-world user studies. Based on the experiment results, observations in the literature, and working hypotheses, we present a series of principles for presenting information to an operator of a remote robot.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.907479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.907479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4339520/04339541.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ecological Interfaces for Improving Mobile Robot Teleoperation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Ecological Interfaces for Improving Mobile Robot Teleoperation","volume":"23","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610218","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339541/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ecological Interfaces for Improving Mobile Robot Teleoperation","sourcePdf":"23tro05-nielsen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144679S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4339520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"4339520","articleId":"4339541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339545,"authors":[{"name":"Aurelio Piazzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Parma, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Aurelio","lastName":"Piazzi","id":"37275997200"},{"name":"Corrado Guarino Lo Bianco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Parma, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Corrado","lastName":"Guarino Lo Bianco","id":"37086194281"},{"name":"Massimo Romano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Parma, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Romano","id":"37276000100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"4339545","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1204},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Path planning","Spline","Polynomials","Acceleration","Spirals","Motion control","Interpolation","Wheels","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","mobile robots","motion control","path planning","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve primitives","path planning","G3-path","arbitrary sequence","interpolation","seventh order polynomial spline","inversion-based motion control","wheeled mobile robots","smooth path generation","eta3-splines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Curve primitives","dynamic path inversion","geometric continuity","polynomial splines","smooth path generation","wheeled mobile robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339545","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> The paper deals with the generation of smooth paths for the inversion-based motion control of wheeled mobile robots. A new path primitive, called <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$ { \\mmb{\\eta } }^{3}$</tex></formula>-spline, is proposed. It is a seventh order polynomial spline which permits the interpolation of an arbitrary sequence of points with associated arbitrary tangent directions, curvatures, and curvature derivatives, so that an overall <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex>$\\mmb G^{3}$</tex></formula>-path is planned.

It is shown that as a result of proper impedance loading there exists a rather wide frequency band over which currents induced to the grids cancel each other, leading to a wide transmission maximum. In this regime radiation is produced by the magnetic dipole moments created by circulating out-of-phase currents flowing in the grids. An impedance matrix representation is derived for the superstrates, and the analytical results are validated using full-wave simulations.

The FSS has good frequency stability for both horizontally and vertically polarized waves incident normally or at oblique angles. Due to its transmission for 900/1800/1900 MHz mobile bands and good absorption for 5 GHz waves, it has the potential as a security wall or isolator for 5 GHz WLAN systems. The absorption in the stop band helps reduce additional WLAN multipath fading caused by conventional reflecting FSS designs. The first layer of the FSS consists of conventional conducting cross dipoles having a circular aperture in the centre, while the second layer uses resistive cross dipoles. Moreover, the conducting cross dipoles have been sandwiched between two dielectric sheets to achieve a stable response for different angles of incidence. The periodicity of both FSS layers is the same while the distance between the two layers is reduced to one eighth of the free-space wavelength. This reduction leads to a more compact design compared to the conventional Salisbury screen, while still achieving acceptable absorption in the stopband. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented to confirm the performance of the absorb/transmit FSS.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.905980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4339553/04339574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.905980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339553","startPage":"2931","endPage":"2934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oblique Incidence Performance of a Novel Frequency Selective Surface Absorber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Oblique Incidence Performance of a Novel Frequency Selective Surface Absorber","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9629998","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339574/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oblique Incidence Performance of a Novel Frequency Selective Surface Absorber","sourcePdf":"55tap10-kiani-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050881S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4339553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4339553","articleId":"4339574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339576,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jia Li","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4339553/4339576/4339576-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Jia Li was born in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, in 1980.

The new method, which is referred to as the FETI-DPEM2, combines the dual-primal idea with two Lagrange multipliers and implements Robin-type transmission condition at the subdomain interfaces to significantly improve the convergence of the interface solution in the high-frequency region. Similar to the original version, a global coarse problem related to the degrees of freedom at the subdomain corner edges is designed to propagate the residual error to the whole computational domain at each iteration, which further increases the convergence.

A performance evaluation method is presented for the realistic UWB WBAN systems, which observes the waveform distortion along the signal path. The measurement and characterization of the 3.1-10.6 GHz on-human-body UWB channel are devised to generate the radiographs of path loss and delay spread for the first time. The performance of the UWB impulse radio WBAN transceiver in terms of bit error rate (BER) is evaluated based on the waveform distortion and on-human-body channel measurement, which shows the human body effect is more significant than the environment effect, especially when the propagation channel contains no line-of-sight path. Various candidate pulse shapes and modulation schemes for UWB WBAN are studied and their performances with the measured WBAN channel are evaluated and compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9630014","htmlLink":"/document/4339596/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of UWB Impulse Radio With Planar Monopoles Over On-Human-Body Propagation Channel for Wireless Body Area Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of UWB Impulse Radio With Planar Monopoles Over On-Human-Body Propagation Channel for Wireless Body Area Networks","sourcePdf":"55tap10-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095763S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4339553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4339553","articleId":"4339596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4339597,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Research Lab, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4339553/4339597/4339597-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yue Ping Zhang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Taiyuan Polytechnic Institute and Shanxi Mining Institute of Taiyuan University of Technology, Shanxi, China, in 1982 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 1995, all in electronic engineering.","From 1982 to 1984, he worked at Shanxi Electronic Industry Bureau, from 1990 to 1992, the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K., and from 1996 to 1997, City University of Hong Kong.

First, the design formulas to determine the patch dimensions and the location of the feed point for single-ended microstrip antennas are examined to design differentially-driven microstrip antennas. It is found that the patch length can still be designed using the formulas for the required resonant frequency but the patch width calculated by the formula usually needs to be widen to ensure the excitation of the fundamental mode using the probe feeds. The condition that links the patch width, the locations of the probe feeds, and the excitation of the fundamental mode is given. Second, the wideband techniques for single-ended microstrip antennas are evaluated for differentially-driven microstrip antennas. A novel H-slot is proposed for differentially-driven microstrip antennas to improve impedance bandwidth. Third, the effects of imperfect differential signal conditions on the performance of differentially-driven microstrip antennas are investigated for the first time. It is found that they only degrade the polarization purity in the -plane with an increased radiation of cross-polarization. Finally, both differentially-driven and single-ended microstrip antennas were fabricated and measured. It is shown that the simulated and measured results are in acceptable agreement. More importantly, it is also shown that the differentially-driven microstrip antenna has wider impedance bandwidth of measured 4.1% and simulated 3.9% and higher gain of measured 4.2 dBi and simulated 3.7 dBi as compared with those of measured 1.9% and simulated 1.3% and gain of measured 1.2 dBi and simulated 1.2 dBi of the single-ended microstrip antenna.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.905832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4339553/04339597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.905832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339553","startPage":"2701","endPage":"2708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Experiment on Differentially-Driven Microstrip Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Experiment on Differentially-Driven Microstrip Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9630015","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339597/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Experiment on Differentially-Driven Microstrip Antennas","sourcePdf":"55tap10-zhang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043784S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4339553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4339553","articleId":"4339597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339598,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Ping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4339553/4339598/4339598-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yue Ping Zhang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Taiyuan Polytechnic Institute and Shanxi Mining Institute of Taiyuan University of Technology, Shanxi, China, in 1982 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 1995, all in electronic engineering.","From 1982 to 1984, he worked at Shanxi Electronic Industry Bureau, from 1990 to 1992, the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K., and from 1996 to 1997, City University of Hong Kong.

Test vehicles were designed and fabricated on silicon wafers of both low and high resistivities, respectively, using complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes. On-wafer measurements for propagation of radio waves over intra-chip channels were conducted in the frequency domain from 10 to 110 GHz with a network analyzer. Time-domain analysis was performed to characterize intra-chip radio channels and more importantly to understand the propagation mechanisms. It was found that path loss factor is constantly less than two and propagation delay of the first-arrival wave is significantly longer than that by free-space transmission. Thus, we concluded that the propagation of radio waves over intra-chip channels is mainly realized with surface wave rather than space wave. Surface wave is guided on air-wafer interface. In addition, effects of metal lines, in both parallel and normal placements with respect to wave propagation direction, on signal propagation were also investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","volume":"55","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9630016","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339598/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Mechanisms of Radio Waves Over Intra-Chip Channels With Integrated Antennas: Frequency-Domain Measurements and Time-Domain Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Mechanisms of Radio Waves Over Intra-Chip Channels With Integrated Antennas: Frequency-Domain Measurements and Time-Domain Analysis","sourcePdf":"55tap10-zhang3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095475S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4339553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4339553","articleId":"4339598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339602,"authors":[{"name":"Marek E.

Measurement result shows that a small-signal gain of 11 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth of 2-9.6 GHz are obtained.

The use of time-domain basis for this method allows for its direct application to data samples collected by a digital oscilloscope or a dedicated A/D converter, and precludes the need for conversion into in-phase and quadrature components. The estimation process described in this paper is based on a maximum likelihood formulation, which allows for the estimate performance to be related to errors associated with sampling and is shown to achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound for variance. Measurements such as the ones described in this paper are important for characterizing interferometric and polarimetric radar systems, as well as for determining the number of observations necessary for achieving a given degree of accuracy in the measurement. By including a statistical description of the estimation process, we enable the ability for using the technique for evaluating hypotheses describing the measurement error model. This last point is critical because it creates a mechanism for accepting or rejecting system model scenarios based on the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of digitized samples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.906543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4339599/04339627.pdf","startPage":"2248","endPage":"2256","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.906543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable Precision Two-Channel Phase, Amplitude, and Timing Measurements for Radar Interferometry and Polarimetry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Variable Precision Two-Channel Phase, Amplitude, and Timing Measurements for Radar Interferometry and Polarimetry","volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4339627/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9629972","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Precision Two-Channel Phase, Amplitude, and Timing Measurements for Radar Interferometry and Polarimetry","sourcePdf":"55tmtt10-siqueira.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062006S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4339599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4339599","articleId":"4339627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4339628,"authors":[{"name":"Jason T.

This paper presents an analysis of the supply rejection properties of RF amplifiers. We extend a conventional Volterra-series formulation to treat multiport systems and use it to describe the mixing products between power supply noise and the RF carrier. It is shown that a multiport Volterra formulation can be used to treat weak nonlinearities in the system and that the nonsymmetric cross terms accurately predict low-order mixing phenomenon. We demonstrate the validity of our hand analysis through the design and fabrication of a power amplifier in 180-nm CMOS, operating between 900 MHz-2.4 GHz with a maximum output power of 15 dBm. Spectral regrowth of single-tone and EDGE modulation waveforms is shown to match within 1-3 dB across frequency and input signal power. Importantly, this analysis provides insight into the circuit-level mechanisms for susceptibility to power supply noise and can help designers improve the power supply rejection ratio robustness of system-on-chip wireless blocks and transmitter architectures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Radio frequency","Power amplifiers","Degradation","RF signals","Fabrication","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","multiport networks","power supply circuits","power supply quality","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-tone modulation waveforms","EDGE modulation waveforms","circuit-level mechanisms","frequency 900 MHz to 2400 MHz","multiport systems","Volterra-series formulation","spectral masks","RF amplifiers","power supply rejection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dc\u2013dc converter","polar modulation","power amplifier (PA)","power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)","RF amplifiers","supply noise"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.905486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4339599/04339628.pdf","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.905486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Supply Rejection for RF Amplifiers: Theory and Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Supply Rejection for RF Amplifiers: Theory and Measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339628/","volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339628/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9629973","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Supply Rejection for RF Amplifiers: Theory and Measurements","sourcePdf":"55tmtt10-stauth.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067143S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4339599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4339599","articleId":"4339628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4339631,"authors":[{"name":"Jeng-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4339599/4339631/4339631-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeng-Han Tsai (S'04) was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., on December 20, 1980.

The stability of the developed time-domain hybrid schemes is shown. Numerical examples are given, illustrating different issues related to presented algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection Framework for Hybrid Methods Derived From Finite-Difference Operators in Time and Frequency Domain","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.906538","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4339599/04339635.pdf","startPage":"2103","endPage":"2114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.906538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Projection Framework for Hybrid Methods Derived From Finite-Difference Operators in Time and Frequency Domain","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4339635/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9629979","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection Framework for Hybrid Methods Derived From Finite-Difference Operators in Time and Frequency Domain","sourcePdf":"55tmtt10-wiktor.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096649S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4339599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4339599","articleId":"4339635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339636,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu Yin Zhang","affiliation":["The Wireless Communications Research Center, Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4339599/4339636/4339636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiu Yin Zhang (S'07) was born in Hubei Province, China.

Two microstrip perturbed ring resonators are employed to obtain dual-mode dual-band responses. Novel feeding structures are introduced to simultaneously feed the ring resonators and conveniently control the coupling strength between resonators and feeding lines, resulting in a wide tunable range of external quality factors. Two kinds of filter configurations with compact size are proposed. Both of them provide sufficient degrees of freedom to satisfy various requirements of external qualify factors and coupling coefficients at both passbands. Therefore, the center frequencies and fractional bandwidths of both passbands can be independently tuned to desired specifications within a wide range. To verify the proposed method, four filters are implemented. The measured results exhibit dual-mode dual-band bandpass responses with high selectivity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Dual-Mode Dual-Band Filters Using Coplanar-Waveguide-Fed Ring Resonators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.906501","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4339599/04339636.pdf","startPage":"2183","endPage":"2190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.906501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Novel Dual-Mode Dual-Band Filters Using Coplanar-Waveguide-Fed Ring Resonators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4339636/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9629980","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Dual-Mode Dual-Band Filters Using Coplanar-Waveguide-Fed Ring Resonators","sourcePdf":"55tmtt10-xzhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.258548S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4339599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4339599","articleId":"4339636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":4339637,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Jan Emery Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4339599/4339637/4339637-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi-Jan Emery Chen (S'97\u2013M'01\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1987, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California at Santa Barbara, CA, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2001.","From 1992 to 1993, he was a Software Engineer with Seimens Telecommunication, where he was involved with working on synchronous optical networks (SONET) equipment development.

presents that advanced actively body-bias controlled (Advanced ABC) technology contributes to enhancing operation margins of SRAMs. Significant enhancement of static noise margin (SNM) is successfully realized by using a body bias of load transistors while suppressing threshold-voltage variations for the first time. It is demonstrated that the write and read margins of 65nm-node SOI SRAMs are improved by the advanced ABC technology. Furthermore, it is found that the SNM is enhanced by 27% for 32nm and 49% for 22nm node. It is summarized that this technology is one of countermeasures for emerging generations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics

various sources of statistical variability in nano-CMOS transistors including random discrete dopants (RDD), line edge roughness (LER), polysilicon granularity (PSG) and interface roughness (IR). We show that the random dopant induced parameter fluctuations in conventional MOSFETs become a showstopper, impacting already adversely on their integration in SRAMs, and may force early transition to UTB SOI and double gate device architectures.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2007.4339737","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339664/4339665/04339737.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2007.4339737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of Statistical Variability in Nano MOSFETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339737/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of Statistical Variability in Nano MOSFETs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9816797","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339737/","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of Statistical Variability in Nano MOSFETs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"VLSIT-00-72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061416S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339664","isNumber":"4339665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339664","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4339665","articleId":"4339737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAPIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339741,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

With this technique, we can improve the performance of MOSFETs more effectively than conventional techniques. In addition, it enables us to use lower LSA temperatures with wide process window (at least 60degC) because of its low sensitivity to LSA temperatures within a certain range, while the conventional ways require ultra high temperatures to improve the device performance. We applied this technique to 45-nm node high performance (HP) CMOS devices with a gate length of 32-nm.

Thanks to a new fully experimental extraction methodology taking into account multi-subband population, we demonstrate that strain takes actively part in quasi-ballistic drain current improvement thanks to a 22% injection velocity enhancement, which will become the predominant transport parameter for the next generation of CMOS devices. In addition, we find that strained channel ballisticity rates are slightly greater than unstrained ones whatever the considered temperature and gate length. This rate improvement can be closely related to the mobility gain for short channel architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339664/4339665/04339754.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"129","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2007.4339754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2007.4339754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Will strain be useful for 10nm quasi-ballistic FDSOI devices?

The device is a p-channel bandgap-engineered SONOS (BE-SONOS), but with ultra-thin ONO tunneling dielectric grown on top of the trapping nitride. Programming and erasing are by -FN electron injection and +FN hole injection from the poly gate, respectively. Since gate oxide is not used as the tunnel dielectric, it is spared of the program/erase current stressing, thus causes much less interface state generation after P/E cycling stressing. Very high endurance (10 M cycle P/E) is achieved owing to suppressed channel interface (S.S. and gm) degradation. Moreover, due to the gate injection instead of channel injection this novel device is insensitive to STI bird's beak geometry. Successful p-channel NAND array characteristics including the program inhibit and reading characteristics are demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Gate-Injection Program/Erase

However, the MIMO wireless channel performance is generally affected by the antenna array configuration and environment characteristic. This paper highlights the impact of angle spread and depolarization effects on the MIMO channel capacity with a focus on 4times4 uniform linear multi-polarized antenna array. We employ a geometric scattering model based on a three-dimensional double bouncing model that takes into account the antenna configurations. We investigate the use of multi-polarization configurations that can provide capacity improvement over conventional single-polarization configurations. The single-polarization configuration is dependent on the depolarization phenomena. It is found that when low depolarization and spatial correlation effects, the capacity of single-polarization configuration behaves better than that of multi-polarization configuration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339782.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Depolarization Effects on MIMO Polarized Wireless Configuration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Polarization","Linear antenna arrays","Antenna arrays","Scattering","Transmitting antennas","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","Antennas and propagation","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","MIMO communication","polarisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depolarization effects","MIMO polarized wireless configuration","wireless communication systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","MIMO wireless channel performance","antenna array configuration","environment characteristic","angle spread","MIMO channel capacity","uniform linear multipolarized antenna array","geometric scattering model","3D double bouncing model","multipolarization configurations","capacity improvement","single-polarization configurations","depolarization phenomena"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Depolarization Effects on MIMO Polarized Wireless Configuration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046109","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Depolarization Effects on MIMO Polarized Wireless Configuration","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035118S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4339783,"authors":[{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-Gyoon","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37278285300"},{"name":"Ke-Chu Yi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ke-Chu","lastName":"Yi","id":"37275564300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339783","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interferometry","Peak to average power ratio","Predistortion","Digital signal processing","Radio frequency","Polynomials","Frequency diversity","Robustness","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","diversity reception","error statistics","interferometry","linearisation techniques","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","polynomials","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM communication system","carrier interferometry","digital linearization","nonlinear compensation","PAPR reduction method","DSP board","polynomial-based predistorter","frequency diversity","narrow band interference","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"For this nonlinear compensation, we address the PAPR reduction method and linearization of HPA at the same time. High quality OFDM communication system is our goal, which can be possible to use the carrier interferometry in the OFDM system and to digitally linearize the nonlinear HPA. The first method is a CI/OFDM (carrier interferometry OFDM) for PAPR reduction of the OFDM signal and the second is the predistortion of HPA for the linearization. In this paper, CI/OFDM system is implemented in the DSP board and RF communication board. Also, polynomial-based predistorter is used for the linearization of the HPA. The CI/OFDM uses full frequency diversity and is robust to the narrow band interference. CI/OFDM lowers down the high PAPR and we can compensate the HPA non-linear distortion by digital predistorter. It is shown that the designed CI/OFDM system has better BER performance and higher power efficiency than the ordinary OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.8","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Quality OFDM Communication System Based on Carrier Interferometry and Digital Linearization of HPA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High Quality OFDM Communication System Based on Carrier Interferometry and Digital Linearization of HPA","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339783/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046110","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339783/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Quality OFDM Communication System Based on Carrier Interferometry and Digital Linearization of HPA","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041577S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339784,"authors":[{"name":"Masoomeh Torabzadeh","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masoomeh","lastName":"Torabzadeh","id":"37640490700"},{"name":"Yusheng Ji","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37287372900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339784","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Processor scheduling","Transmitting antennas","Throughput","Scheduling algorithm","Downlink","Fading","Traffic control","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","packet switching","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network resource allocation","cellular network","packet scheduler","MIMO packet-by-packet generalized processor sharing","MPGPS","fair scheduling"]}],"abstract":"The problem of allocating network resources to the users of a cellular network with multiple antennas in a fair way is investigated.

Comparisons with a couple of scheduling algorithms considering traffic characteristics and the mobility of users demonstrate the superior performance of our scheduler.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Packet-by-Packet Generalized Processor Sharing: MPGPS","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.9","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339784.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Packet-by-Packet Generalized Processor Sharing: MPGPS","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339784/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046111","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Packet-by-Packet Generalized Processor Sharing: MPGPS","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067604S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339785,"authors":[{"name":"Min Jia","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Jia","id":"38666342600"},{"name":"Xue-Mai Gu","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xue-Mai","lastName":"Gu","id":"37535057400"},{"name":"Se-Bin Im","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Se-Bin","lastName":"Im","id":"37397093100"},{"name":"Hyung-Jin Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Jin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290851000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339785","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Time domain analysis","OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Partial transmit sequences","Estimation error","Fading","Frequency estimation","Mean square error methods","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","channel estimation","time-domain processing","channel impulse response","cyclic correlation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing estimation error","long cyclic prefix","mean square error"]}],"abstract":"Channel impulse response (CIR) can be estimated by time-domain processing (TDP) based on cyclic correlation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We propose an improved generalized TDP method to reduce the estimation error by taking the average of different CIR values which are derived according to the different starting points of cyclic correlation. Moreover, an effective channel length estimation method which is performed by reverse detection processing to search the last effective CIR is also proposed. The whole proposed method is more efficient to OFDM systems with long cyclic prefix (CP) because the CP information is sufficiently utilized during the CIR estimation. The analysis and the simulation results verify that the mean square error (MSE) performance of the proposed method is 4-5 dB better than the conventional method under the same conditions.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.10","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Channel Estimation Method Based on Time-Domain Processing for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Channel Estimation Method Based on Time-Domain Processing for OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339785/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046112","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Channel Estimation Method Based on Time-Domain Processing for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037559S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4339786,"authors":[{"name":"Hancheng Liao","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Hancheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37289382800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339786","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Fading","OFDM","Spread spectrum communication","Bit rate","Wireless LAN","Finance","Interference elimination","Multiple access interference","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective fading channel","orthogonal subcarriers","intersymbol interference","multiple access interference","bit rate transmission","large-area-synchronized OFDM"]}],"abstract":"With spectrum spreaded by LAS multiple access codes and orthogonal subcarriers being utilized, LAS-OFDM system bring the merits of both technologies into play.

The computation complexity and the mean square error (MSE) performance of our proposed RLS method are compared with the original RLS method.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.16","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339791.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems Based on RLS and Superimposed Training Sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems Based on RLS and Superimposed Training Sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339791/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046118","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems Based on RLS and Superimposed Training Sequences","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080758S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339792,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjun Huo","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Huo","id":"37589154100"},{"name":"Zhigang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291900700"},{"name":"Shentang Li","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shentang","lastName":"Li","id":"37292196500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339792","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"In this paper, a simple subspace based semi-blind channel estimator is developed for precoded OFDM systems.

The ambiguity can be resolved with the known pilots inserted in the transmitted sequences. Computer simulations are conducted to support our analysis.

The exact expressions of the bit error rate and capacity of the GMD-based single user MIMO multiplexing system in the downlink are presented. The multiuser average capacity obtained by scheduling is derived. By evaluating these expressions, we analytically show that, compared with the singular value decomposition-based MIMO (SVD-based MIMO) system, the GMD-based scheme make it rather convenient to design modulation and coding schemes for the subchannels when adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) are used. In addition, it is also shown that the multiuser average capacity of MIMO systems with small number of antennas can approach that with relative larger number of antennas when the number of scheduled users is sufficient large.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Multiuser Diversity in Geometric Mean Decomposition-Based MIMO System","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339797.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Multiuser Diversity in Geometric Mean Decomposition-Based MIMO System","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339797/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046123","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Multiuser Diversity in Geometric Mean Decomposition-Based MIMO System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046179S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339798,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxu Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Jingxu","lastName":"Han","id":"37673174700"},{"name":"Emmanuel Bejide","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Bejide","id":"37275190800"},{"name":"Mquele E.

This method divides OFDM symbols in frequency domain into subblocks and rotates each subblock phase with phase factors. Then these subblocks are transformed into time domain sequences by IDFT and permutations are performed among these subblocks in different symbols. For complexity reduction, two suboptimal schemes time shifting (TS-TPPR) and random selecting (RS-TPPR) are proposed. Simulation results show our methods can obtain significant PAPR reduction gains, and compared to multi-symbol SLM, RS-TPPR can provide better performance with the same complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Time-Frequency Processing","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.30","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339805.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Time-Frequency Processing","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339805/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046131","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Time-Frequency Processing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082102S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339806,"authors":[{"name":"Hancheng Liao","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Hancheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37289382800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339806","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Multiaccess communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","MIMO","Bit error rate","Detectors","Multiple access interference","Delay","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","MIMO communication","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-LAS-CDMA system","multiple antennas","large area synchronized code division multiple access","mobile communication systems","multiple input multiple output technique"]}],"abstract":"Large area synchronized code division multiple access (LAS-CDMA) technology is an excellent CDMA technology an can be applied in the future mobile communication systems. If the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technique is integrated into LAS-CDMA system, better performance can be obtained. For example, in such MIMO-LAS-CDMA system, many antennas are used in each transmitter to transmit data of the same user and the data streams of each antenna are different and even independent. On the standpoint of the subscribers, the system capacity is greatly enhanced. It is said that the system has realized the multiplexing operation. Meanwhile, many antennas are also used in the receiver to receive the same data stream, so that the receiving diversity of space is achieved. Through reducing the bit-error-rate (BER), it helps to increase the system performance all in all. The LAS multiple access codes with spreading factor 32 is used in the simulation and the BER performance of such MIMO-LAS-CDMA system is given for some certain examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-LAS-CDMA System with Multiple Antennas","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.31","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339806.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-LAS-CDMA System with Multiple Antennas","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339806/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046132","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-LAS-CDMA System with Multiple Antennas","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053452S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339807,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Xu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37714620100"},{"name":"Feng Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37713546400"},{"name":"Xubin Cheng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Xubin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37710298000"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339807","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Transmitters","Jamming","Signal to noise ratio","Interference suppression","Noise cancellation","Interference cancellation","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit preprocessing technique","multi-user MIMO system downlink","signal to jamming and noise ratio maximization method","multi-stream per-user interference","post-processing matrix"]}],"abstract":"A novel transmit preprocessing technique for the multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink is presented in this paper.

However, in practice, there is an undesirable but non-negligible effect, namely the asymmetric interference, that makes the assumptions no longer valid. In such a case, the downlink modulation/coding parameters assigned based on the uplink measurements may lead to excessively high frame error rate (FER). In this paper, a simple closed-loop feedback method of compensating interference asymmetry in TDD multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is proposed, which makes the transmit side estimated interference tracks the instantaneous receive side interference dynamically. The proposed method maintains constant FER by adopting adaptive modulation coding (AMC) and power loading. The final simulations have verified the effectiveness of the new method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339808.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of Interference Non-Reciprocity in TDD MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference elimination","Modulation coding","MIMO","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Downlink","OFDM modulation","Error analysis","Feedback","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference elimination","nonreciprocity","TDD MIMO-OFDM systems","wireless communications","time-division duplex deployment","channel reciprocity","transmitter","receiver","asymmetric interference","frame error rate","closed-loop feedback","multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","adaptive modulation coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of Interference Non-Reciprocity in TDD MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339808/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046134","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of Interference Non-Reciprocity in TDD MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03933S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4339809,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Gao","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Gao","id":"37405516000"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jinkuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Yun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37697569700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339809","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Signal processing algorithms","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Information science","Power engineering and energy","Computational complexity","Partial transmit sequences","OFDM modulation","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","communication complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity PAPR reduction technique","STBC MIMO-OFDM system","selective mapping algorithm","peak-to-average power ration","conjugate symbols","orthogonal space-time block code","computational complexity","side information","concurrent SLM algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"Selective mapping algorithm is proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ration (PAPR) in MIMO-OFDM system.

In this paper, another important system performance criterion, i.e., the achievable capacity, is addressed for Alamouti coded OFDM systems. Based on the effective signal-to-noise ratio, the bound of ergodic and outage capacities are derived analytically. Numerical results show that these bounds are tight enough and can be used to predict the system performance.

An improved list sphere-decoding (ILSD) SISO demapper without the requirement of initial radius is also adopted.

We extend joint detection (JD) to systems with TO, where the misaligned interference will be considered as noise and thus merged into the additive noise.

In this paper, we propose an iterative technique, decision-aided reconstruction (DAR) to improve the SER performance. The proposed technique can mitigate the interference by making the symbol decision in the frequency domain and then converting the symbol back to the time domain.

At high SNR, the closed-form expression for the channel capacity of MIMO system is given by using the properties of Wishart distribution. Computer simulation results show that the channel capacity is maximized when the antenna spacing increases to a certain point. At high SNR, the estimation of channel capacity is close to its true value.

Also we deduce a iterative formula to compute the weights. Compared with partial transmit sequence (PTS) and selected mapping (SLM) algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows its better performance on PAPR reduction. Bit error rate (BER) analysis indicates that the amplitude of the weights has a great impact on the BER performance of the system. Appropriate restriction on the amplitude can get good performance in both PAPR and BER. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is better than PTS and SLM algorithm in PAPR reduction performance, while satisfying BER performance, for example, PAPR reduction can be up to 2.5 dB decrease when dividing the subcarriers into 4 subgroups.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.43","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction Iterative Algorithm via Adding Weights to Amplitudes and Phases of OFDM Subcarriers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction Iterative Algorithm via Adding Weights to Amplitudes and Phases of OFDM Subcarriers","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339818/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046144","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339818/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction Iterative Algorithm via Adding Weights to Amplitudes and Phases of OFDM Subcarriers","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046079S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339819,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Key Lab of Information Processing and Intelligent Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Yonghua Li","affiliation":["Key Lab of Information Processing and Intelligent Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yonghua","lastName":"Li","id":"37292406800"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Information Processing and Intelligent Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Key Lab of Information Processing and Intelligent Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"},{"name":"Weiling Wu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Information Processing and Intelligent Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280426600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339819","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339819","abstract":"MIMO system has been proven to provide more capacity than conventional SISO system, which is linear increase with the number of minimum transmit and receive antennas.

Linear precoder and decoder enable optimal allocation of power and bits over the spatial and temporal domain, depend on the channel conditions. Based on the two criterions, Maximum information rate and Minimum Mean Square Error, the optimal MIMO capacity is deduced and shown that the optimum linear precoder and decoder diagonalize the MIMO channel into eigen subchannels.

The correlation coefficient is the function of antennas spacing, angular spread, power angular spectrum, mean angle-of-arrival, Doppler spread and delay spread. In space domain, the capacity increases with antenna spacing and angular spread. For multiple clusters incidence wave, the correlation coefficient and capacity will oscillate with increasing antenna spacing. The capacity will decrease with increasing Rician factor. In time domain, the capacity gets higher with increasing Doppler and delay spread.

Numerous types of utility functions have been proposed and examined in the corresponding literature. However, the majority of the known utility functions only take a fixed mathematical form or are just based on simple combining, which can not fully exploit available network information. In this paper, we focus on a framework of QoS oriented cross layer optimization based on Adaptively Weighted Utility Functions (AWUF) in OFDMA networks. Under this framework, a sub-optimal solution is proposed, which has a potential ability to update control parameters in real-time and accommodate instantaneous QoS constrains. The simulation results revealed that the AUWF based algorithm not only achieved higher throughput, but also simultaneously reduced average queue length and packet delay under unsymmetrical traffic loads among multiple users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation for QoS Oriented Cross Layer Optimization in OFDMA Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.53","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339828.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation for QoS Oriented Cross Layer Optimization in OFDMA Networks","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339828/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046154","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation for QoS Oriented Cross Layer Optimization in OFDMA Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048575S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339829,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Hui","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hui","id":"37717637400"},{"name":"Zhijie Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37714736100"},{"name":"Wenqiang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenqiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37597075100"},{"name":"Chunsheng Zhang","affiliation":["The Equipment Research Institute of Second Artillery, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37710996900"},{"name":"Ping Zhan","affiliation":["The Equipment Research Institute of Second Artillery, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37698563700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339829","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Channel state information","Parity check codes","MIMO","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Decoding","Transmitters","Modulation coding","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity-check code","adaptive code","MIMO-OFDM System","statistical channel state information","QAM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple input multiple output technique"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive MIMO OFDM system using QAM and LDPC code is proposed with only two parameters required to be sent to the transmitter, which are the mean and the variance.

However this sounder has a big drawback that the accuracy of channel measurement is degraded largely in fast fading environment. To overcome this limitation, channel sounding architecture based on frequency division multiplexing (FDM)[1] has already proposed, but the performance comparison between novel FDM scheme and conventional TDM scheme was not presented. In this paper, channel sounding performance between conventional TDM scheme and proposed FDM scheme is compared by mean square error (MSE) and angular spread error (ASE) through simulation. As a result, it is shown that the FDM sounding architecture measures MIMO channel more accurately than TDM sounding architecture with regard to MSE and ASE.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.55","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339830.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of MIMO Channel Sounder Architecture in Between TDM scheme and FDM scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339830/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of MIMO Channel Sounder Architecture in Between TDM scheme and FDM scheme","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046156","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339830/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of MIMO Channel Sounder Architecture in Between TDM scheme and FDM scheme","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045116S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339831,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37288452400"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538912600"},{"name":"Qianxi Lu","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Qianxi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37398732800"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339831","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Resource management","Signal processing algorithms","Downlink","Temperature","Interference constraints","System performance","AWGN","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier allocation","water-filling level","OFDMA","cognitive radio networks","resource allocation","water-filling power allocation scheme","interference temperature constraints","channel quality"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio makes it possible for an unlicensed user to access a spectrum unoccupied by the licensed user.

Along with the requirement for higher system capacity, how to improve cell edge performance to provide better QoS (quality of service) support has become a pressing issue. Considering the channel characteristic in wireless communication, new interference avoidance based algorithms, which consider both time domain and frequency domains, are proposed to mitigate the influence of frequency selective channel on cell edge user in MIMO-OFDM system. Meanwhile, in order to further improve the system spectral efficiency, an algorithm that integrates beamforming is put forward. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can improve the throughput of cell edge user effectively as well as the overall system throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-Channel Interference Mitigation in MIMO-OFDM System","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.58","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339833.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Co-Channel Interference Mitigation in MIMO-OFDM System","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339833/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046159","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-Channel Interference Mitigation in MIMO-OFDM System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05697S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339834,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National key Lab of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37556980400"},{"name":"Xia Lei","affiliation":["National key Lab of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Lei","id":"37409537500"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National key Lab of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339834","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","1f noise","Fading","Intersymbol interference","Degradation","Interchannel interference","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset estimator","OFDM systems","cyclic prefix","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an improved carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator using cyclic prefix (CP) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

In the proposed scheme, the pilot tones sent by different transmit antennas can be superimposed on the same sub-carrier due to the pilot symbol orthogonality. This can save bandwidth and increase the system data rates. At the receiver, by separating the orthogonal pilot tones, the sampled frequency response could be obtained, and then used to track the whole channel frequency response in real time through interpolation. Due to the save of pilot sub-carriers and the real time tracking ability in the proposed algorithm, simulation results show effective performance in static and mobile situation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339837.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Channel Estimation Technique for MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Superimposed Comb Type Pilot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Frequency response","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Bandwidth","Signal processing algorithms","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Antenna accessories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interpolation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM systems","superimposed comb type pilot","orthogonal pilot tones","transmit antennas","pilot symbol orthogonality","channel frequency response","time tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Channel Estimation Technique for MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Superimposed Comb Type Pilot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339837/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046163","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Channel Estimation Technique for MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Superimposed Comb Type Pilot","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053748S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339838,"authors":[{"name":"Linhai Li","affiliation":["Department of Commun.

The auto-correlation functions of all LS codes are ideal, and there exists an interference-free window (IFW) or a zero correlation zone (ZCZ) in their cross-correlation functions of the LS codes around the origin. These properties of the LS codes make the synchronization of the MIMO OFDM system easily and more accurate. The synchronization process proposed in this paper can be viewed as the four stage process of 1) segmented matched filter based coarse time acquisition, 2) the coarse frequency offset estimation by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique with quadratic interpolation in the frequency domain, 3) fine time acquisition and channel estimation by LS code coherent detection, 4) phase rotation based fine frequency offset estimation. Through the simulation, the synchronization algorithm shows satisfactory performance even at a low SNR, high frequency offset and in a frequency selective channel.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.70","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339845.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization for MIMO OFDM Systems with Loosely Synchronous (LS) Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339845/","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization for MIMO OFDM Systems with Loosely Synchronous (LS) Codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046171","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339845/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization for MIMO OFDM Systems with Loosely Synchronous (LS) Codes","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05747S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4339846,"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339846","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Iterative decoding","OFDM modulation","Channel estimation","Iterative methods","Data communication","Phase detection","Frequency estimation","Fading","Ionosphere"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","error statistics","frequency hop communication","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood detection","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative demodulation","iterative decoding","frequency-hopped OFDM system","noncoherent maximum-likelihood sequence detection","short-wave communication","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"According to the characteristic of short-wave frequency-hopped (FH) communication, an OFDM/FH system based on iterative demodulation and decoding is proposed.

In particular, we present a criterion of relay-selection based on position of the relay and SNR gains of the relay channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339848/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046174","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Space Time Coding in Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Time Coding in Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Channel","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04578S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339849,"authors":[{"name":"Basel Rihawi","affiliation":["IETR/Sup\u00e9lec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Basel","lastName":"Rihawi","id":"37706628300"},{"name":"Yeves Louet","affiliation":["IETR/Sup\u00e9lec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Yeves","lastName":"Louet","id":"37571400800"},{"name":"Sidkieta Zabre","affiliation":["IETR/Sup\u00e9lec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Sidkieta","lastName":"Zabre","id":"37688621400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339849","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","MIMO","WiMAX","Degradation","Bit error rate","OFDM modulation","Receiving antennas","Telephony","Broadband communication","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","4G broadband wireless communications","multiple-input multiple-output system","peak-to-average power ratio","second order cone programming problem","tone reservation approach","bit-error-rate","IEEE 802.16 WiMAX standard"]}],"abstract":"A combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has became a promising candidate for high performance 4G broadband wireless communications. However, like OFDM, one main disadvantage of MIMO-OFDM is that the signals transmitted on different antennas may exhibit a prohibitively large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper we extend the formulation of the reduction of the PAPR problem as second order cone programming problem (SOCP) [1] to MIMO- OFDM. The investigated PAPR reduction method is originally based on a particular case of tone reservation (TR) approach which uses the unused carriers of standards. This approach does not degrade the bit-error-rate (BER) or the data rate and no side information (SI) is required. Simulation results are presented for a MIMO-OFDM system with two antennas and 256 carriers as in IEEE 802.16 WiMAX standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction Scheme with SOCP for MIMO-OFDM","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.74","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339849.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction Scheme with SOCP for MIMO-OFDM","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339849/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046175","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction Scheme with SOCP for MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075824S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339850,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37656978100"},{"name":"Hui Yang","firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37714340400"},{"name":"Dongweon Yoon","firstName":"Dongweon","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37266960200"},{"name":"Sang Kyu Park","firstName":"Sang Kyu","lastName":"Park","id":"37280888900"},{"name":"Soobum Cho","firstName":"Soobum","lastName":"Cho","id":"37293576100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339850","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Peak to average power ratio","Fading","Bit error rate","OFDM modulation","Intersymbol interference","Robustness","Distortion","Signal generators","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","fading channels","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel estimation","side information scheme","OFDM signals","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation","intersymbol interference","peak-to-average power ratio","fading channels","adaptive symbol selection scheme","data information","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a special form of multi-carrier modulation which is robust against the multipath effect and inter symbol interference (ISI). However, it is very sensitive to nonlinear effects due to the high peak-to- average power ratio (PAPR) owned by the transmitted signals. To reduce PAPR and improve the error performances of the OFDM signals over fading channels, an OFDM system in which adaptive symbol selection scheme (ASSS) and channel estimation are combined together can be used. The data rate is reduced somewhat in the conventional transmission method because the side information is transmitted with the data information. In order to increase data rate, we propose a new technique to transmit the side information separately in the pilot tones. We demonstrate that the proposed technique can give reasonable bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels while effectively reducing the PAPR.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.75","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339850.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Side Information Scheme for Adaptively Selected OFDM Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339850/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Side Information Scheme for Adaptively Selected OFDM Signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046176","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339850/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Side Information Scheme for Adaptively Selected OFDM Signals","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040036S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339852,"authors":[{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["UniK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Lingyang","lastName":"Song","id":"37288632100"},{"name":"Are Hjorungnes","affiliation":["UniK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Are","lastName":"Hjorungnes","id":"37270835900"},{"name":"Alister Burr","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Alister","lastName":"Burr","id":"37273411200"},{"name":"Manav Bhatnagar","affiliation":["UniK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Manav","lastName":"Bhatnagar","id":"37406036800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339852","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Block codes","Decoding","Modulation coding","Constellation diagram","Transmitting antennas","Encoding","Detectors","Transmitters","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","block codes","decoding","diversity reception","modulation","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential tranceiver design","differential modulation scheme","partial-diversity quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes","full-diversity quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes","transmit antennas","differential encoding","differential decoding","Alamouti codes","partial transmit diversity","linear signal detector","current communication systems"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we report a general and simple differential modulation scheme that can be applied to both partial-diversity quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes and full-diversity quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes for four transmit antennas. The differential encoding and decoding can be simplified to differential Alamouti codes by grouping the signals in the transmitted matrix and decoupling the detection of data symbols, respectively. For the codes with partial transmit diversity, the new scheme can achieve constant amplitude of transmitted signals, and avoid signal constellation expansion, and it has a linear signal detector with very low complexity. Simulation results show that these partial-diversity codes can provide very useful results at low SNR for current communication systems.

The algorithm and simulation include two stages. The first stage involves the application of a target BER and SNR of each sub-carrier for a variable-rate bit pre-allocation. The second stage applies greedy and Campello approach to achieve constant channel rate of bit allocation. In a word, bit allocation with constant rate performs variable rate bit allocation first, and then modifies the overall bits to a constant. The simulation results demonstrate that the scheme has significant computational advantages over the conventional algorithms while providing optimal performance.

And, it also shows that the capacity is asymptotically linear in the logarithm of SNR and the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas with the growth of SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison and Analysis of MIMO Channel Capacity","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.81","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339856.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Comparison and Analysis of MIMO Channel Capacity","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339856/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046182","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison and Analysis of MIMO Channel Capacity","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042107S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339857,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Luo","id":"37268258700"},{"name":"Qinye Yin","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Qinye","lastName":"Yin","id":"37270668400"},{"name":"Le Ding","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Ding","id":"37824328000"},{"name":"Ke Deng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Deng","id":"37275596400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339857","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339857","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Fading","Receiving antennas","Sparse matrices","US Department of Defense","Parameter estimation","Transmitting antennas","Direction of arrival estimation","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least squares approximations","linear antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","channel correlation","flat-fading","correlated MIMO system","multipath components","uniform linear arrays","channel matrix","least square methods"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation in Correlated Flat MIMO systems","startPage":"302","endPage":"305","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.82","abstract":"In this paper, we address channel estimation in a flat-fading correlated MIMO system employing uniform linear arrays on dual side.

From the results, it is shown that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm, as well as the resistance to frequency selective fading and noise, is much better than that of the algorithm based on cyclic prefix.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation Method for OFDM Based on Time Oversampling","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.87","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339862.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation Method for OFDM Based on Time Oversampling","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339862/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046188","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation Method for OFDM Based on Time Oversampling","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045842S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339863,"authors":[{"name":"Guili Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guili","lastName":"Chen","id":"37714175900"},{"name":"Lin Qi","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Qi","id":"37288542200"},{"name":"Yanhui Lu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanhui","lastName":"Lu","id":"37656766200"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339863","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Array signal processing","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Adaptive arrays","MIMO","Electrical capacitance tomography","Antenna arrays","OFDM","Educational institutions","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","adaptive beamforming","MIMO-OFDMA system","priority user","total transmission power","spatial diversity","multiuser diversity","eigenvalues","QoS requirements","quality of service","subcarriers reallocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new resource allocation scheme for MIMO-OFDMA systems with a priority user.

However, in the military application fields the performance deteriorates significantly in presence of directional interferences from certain directions. While few methods for suppressing the directional interferences exist, in this paper, a reception scheme based on a linear separation processing is proposed to suppress the directional interferences. It's capable of reaching the maximum likelihood (ML) boundary, as long as the interference is Gaussian distributed. Moreover, the absence of direct computation of inverse matrix decreases the complexity of processing at the receiver.

For any matrix H and any permutation matrix P, the equation HP = QR always holds where P represents the detection ordering. In order to find an appropriate P to reduce the SD search complexity, we propose a novel detection ordering mechanism based on the principle of maximizing the minimal row entry (MMRE). Its corresponding QR factorization method is also presented. Different from other ordering mechanisms, the MMRE mechanism prevents the SD search from going deep on the incorrect subtrees by introducing an error-amplifying strategy. The simulations prove the effectiveness of the MMRE.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.94","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339869.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Blind Signal Detection Based on the Sphere Decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339869/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Blind Signal Detection Based on the Sphere Decoder","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046195","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339869/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Blind Signal Detection Based on the Sphere Decoder","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098013S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339870,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Ji","affiliation":["Department of Avionics Engineering, The Engineering Institute AFEU, Xi'an, P.R.

First we group different types of service into four types according to 802.16 protocol. Then we use a two-layer scheduling architecture to shape traffic at medium access (MAC) layer: the first layer schedules packets for different users of the same service type and the second layer schedules packets of different service types. At last, we propose a resource allocation algorithm that allocates wireless resource efficiently at physic (PHY) layer according to the scheduling results of the MAC layer. Compared with [8], simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve significant improvement in packet drop rate, packet delay, and system throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339877.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Layer Design in Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Space-Time Block Coding for IEEE 802.16","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Block codes","Resource management","Scheduling algorithm","Access protocols","Shape","Physics","Physical layer","Delay systems","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","block codes","IEEE standards","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","space-time codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","cross-layer design","space-time block coding","IEEE 802.16","packet scheduling","adaptive resource allocation","protocol","medium access layer","MAC layer","wireless resource","physic layer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Layer Design in Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Space-Time Block Coding for IEEE 802.16","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339877/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046203","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Layer Design in Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Space-Time Block Coding for IEEE 802.16","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063023S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339878,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Lu","affiliation":["ShangHai JiaoTong University, ShangHai, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Lu","id":"38041896300"},{"name":"Jianhua Ge","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Ge","id":"37273602800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339878","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-varying channels","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","OFDM modulation","Autocorrelation","Intersymbol interference","Receiving antennas","Electrical engineering","Channel estimation","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO OFDM systems","modulatable orthogonal polyphase sequences","time-varying channel","channel impulse response"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, new training sequences and frame structure are proposed to estimate time-varying channel for MIMO OFDM systems.

Then, three schemes are formed as follows: scheme A , an union of ML+SOPI and one-tap equalizer (OTE), where interpolation is based on symbol level and CIR viewed as constant; scheme B, a combination of ML+SOPI and zero- forcing equalizer (ZFE), where interpolation is conducted on sampling-point level and CIR approximated as linear; scheme C, an union of ML+SOPI and Jeon equalizer with the same assumptions as scheme B. The complexity of ZFE in scheme B is reduced by Neumann expansion and IFFT/FFT, which has far lower complexity than Jeon equalizer for long cyclic prefix(>10).

Simulation results show that the new estimator performs better than the former ones.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.110","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339885.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative LS Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems Based on Transform-Domain Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339885/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative LS Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems Based on Transform-Domain Processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046210","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339885/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative LS Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems Based on Transform-Domain Processing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04675S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4339886,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Zheng","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37308248000"},{"name":"Jing Han","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Han","id":"37712893100"},{"name":"Jingyang Lv","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingyang","lastName":"Lv","id":"37671124600"},{"name":"Weiling Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280426600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339886","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Frequency synchronization","MIMO","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Transmitting antennas","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Receiving antennas","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing synchronization scheme","frequency synchronization scheme","MIMO OFDM System","chu sequence-based preamble","transmit antennas","right timing detection probability","fractional frequency synchronization","frequency selective channel","integral frequency offset","time domain","multiple-input multiple- output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a fast and reliable technique for timing and frequency synchronization of multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The synchronization is achieved using one chu sequence-based preamble which is simultaneously transmitted from all transmit antennas in the same OFDM time instant. From analysis, the chu sequence-based preamble gives better detection properties in terms of higher right timing detection probability and accurate fractional frequency synchronization even at a low SNR and in a frequency selective channel. Furthermore, application of the proposed algorithm can obtain the integral frequency offset in time domain.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.111","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339886.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","startPage":"420","endPage":"423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Timing and Frequency Synchronization Scheme for MIMO OFDM System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Timing and Frequency Synchronization Scheme for MIMO OFDM System","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339886/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046211","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339886/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Timing and Frequency Synchronization Scheme for MIMO OFDM System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042611S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339887,"authors":[{"name":"Mengxing Li","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mengxing","lastName":"Li","id":"37675085000"},{"name":"Longyang Huang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Longyang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37538426300"},{"name":"Zemin Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zemin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289193400"},{"name":"Weimin Zuo","affiliation":["Department of computer science & technology, Hunan City University, Yiyang, China"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37719833700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339887","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"A improved algorithm to perform channel estimation and equalization for multiple input multiple output(MIMO) systems in frequency and time-selective fading environments is put forward. lt contains two steps: training and tracking. In training phase, improved Kalman filtering, namely robust Kalman filtering(RKF), is exploited to estimate channel impulse response(CIR). After that, in tracking stage,the RKF and minimum mean-square error feedback decision equalizer (MMSE-DFE) cooperate to track the time-varying channel. The RKF recursions is presented and a closed-form solution for baud rate MIMO MMSE-DFE under perfect knowledge of CIR and correct past decisions conditions is derived. In addition, it regards unknown dc-offset due to zero intermediate frequency(IF) at the receiver as the mean of measurement noise, which is estimated as a byproduct through robust Kalman filters. Finally, it is compared with well-known ones,such as least mean-square (LMS), recursive least square (RLS), Kalman filtering (KF). All these show that the proposal exhibits better performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339887.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"427","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint MIMO Channel Estimation and Equalization in Doubly-Selective Fading Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Fading","Frequency estimation","Kalman filters","Filtering","Robustness","Phase estimation","Feedback","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","fading channels","Kalman filters","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","time-varying channels","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel estimation","MIMO channel equalization","doubly-selective fading channel","multiple input multiple output systems","frequency-selective fading channel","time-selective fading channel","robust Kalman filtering","channel impulse response","minimum mean-square error feedback decision equalizer","MMSE-DFE","time-varying channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint MIMO Channel Estimation and Equalization in Doubly-Selective Fading Environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339887/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046212","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint MIMO Channel Estimation and Equalization in Doubly-Selective Fading Environments","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046949S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4339889,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Xu","firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Zhong-Tang He","firstName":"Zhong-Tang","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Su-Xiao Xu","firstName":"Su-Xiao","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Zi-Li Chen","firstName":"Zi-Li","lastName":"Chen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339889","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"abstract":"GMD-VBLAST algorithm proposed recently can decomposition a MIMO channel into multiple identical parallel sub-channels with same SNR.

Since known channel structures facilitate space-time decouple, the common space mode is estimated as a whole for all the shared subcarriers. A recursive fast subspace approximation tracking algorithm combined with a least square (LS) estimator is applied to track space-time modes under non-stationary noise circumstances. Simulation demonstrates the hybrid approach has a good mean-square error performance.

On the other hand, multiuser joint subcarrier allocation can obtain multiuser diversity gain in frequency domain. In this paper, a novel joint spatial and frequency proportional fairness (SFPF) scheduler is proposed to achieve the spatial-frequency multiuser diversity gain for multiuser MIMO OFDMA based LTE TDD system while guarantees the multiuser fairness. To approach the multiuser capacity, multiuser ZFB (Mu-ZFB) is adopted for spatial multiplexing of multiuser on the same subcarrier. To simplify the antenna selection of Mu-ZFB, three simplified multiuser antenna selection algorithms are proposed, optimal, random and suboptimal antenna selection and their performance is evaluated in a single cell scenario. The optimal algorithm can achieve the best performance but has the highest complexity. The random algorithm has the worst performance but the lowest complexity. The performance comparison in a multi-cell scenario shows that three algorithms of SFPF can obtain a similar system throughput when guarantee the user fairness. While the suboptimal algorithm is a tradeoff between the performance and the complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339904.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"494","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Spatial and Frequency Proportional Fairness Scheduling for MIMO OFDMA Downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Diversity methods","Throughput","Scheduling","Frequency diversity","Array signal processing","Frequency domain analysis","Bandwidth","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","radio links","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency proportional fairness scheduling","spatial proportional fairness scheduling","MIMO OFDMA downlink","zero forcing beamforming","multiuser spatial multiplexing gain","diversity gain","spatial multiuser scheduling","multiuser joint subcarrier allocation","multiuser diversity gain","LTE TDD system","multiuser capacity","multiuser antenna selection algorithms","suboptimal antenna selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Spatial and Frequency Proportional Fairness Scheduling for MIMO OFDMA Downlink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339904/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046228","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Spatial and Frequency Proportional Fairness Scheduling for MIMO OFDMA Downlink","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0436S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4339905,"authors":[{"name":"Shubo Ren","affiliation":["Satellite and Wireless Communication Laboratory, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shubo","lastName":"Ren","id":"37721791500"},{"name":"Junqi Guo","affiliation":["Satellite and Wireless Communication Laboratory, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junqi","lastName":"Guo","id":"37713538200"},{"name":"Haige Xiang","affiliation":["Satellite and Wireless Communication Laboratory, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haige","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37271811200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339905","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339905","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitters","Frequency-selective fading channels","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Performance analysis","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Computational complexity","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation algorithm","MIMO","single carrier frequency domain equalization system","frequency selective fading channels","pseudo noise sequences","channel impulse responses","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"We propose in this paper a channel estimation algorithm in MIMO-Single Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization (MIMO-SCFDE) system over frequency-selective fading channels.

Moreover, in order to collect enough signal energy from dense multi-path components, the number of Rake fingers must be large enough. Consequently, the receiver structure is too complex to be implemented in practice. However, we know that adaptive signal detection performs well in DS-CDMA systems due to its simple algorithm and robustness of anti-interference. In this paper, we propose an indoor high data rate wireless link scheme based on adaptive minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver for DS-UWB transmission. Its bit error rate (BER) performance is analyzed under the newly proposed IEEE 802.15.3a UWB indoor channel model. Simulation results show that, nearly without loss of BER performance compared with the traditional Rake receiver scheme, the proposed scheme requires no channel estimation and, therefore, is simpler in structure and easier for implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339924/","accessionNumber":"10046248","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MMSE Receiver Based DS-UWB Indoor Transmission Scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MMSE Receiver Based DS-UWB Indoor Transmission Scheme","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080569S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4339926,"authors":[{"name":"Shushan Qiao","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shushan","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37602551100"},{"name":"Yong Hei","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Hei","id":"37666512500"},{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37672145300"},{"name":"Yumei Zhou","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yumei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37399622400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339926","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Hardware","Fast Fourier transforms","Ultra wideband technology","Pipelines","Costs","Delay","Feedback","Process design","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT processor","UWB systems","fast Fourier Transform processor","Radix-2 Single path Delay Feedback architecture"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel 128-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor for practical Ultra-wideband (UWB) applications.

Our results show that the two-hop-relay WCDMA cellular outperforms the traditional WCDMA cellular systems in terms of the average downlink transmission rate, but increases the call blocking probability of packets of the system simultaneously, and the two-hop-relay WCDMA cellular systems with congestion control can decrease the call blocking probability further, while preserve the improvement for the average downlink transmission rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339962.pdf","startPage":"722","endPage":"726","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Two-Hop-Relay WCDMA Cellular Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Relays","Downlink","Control systems","Wireless LAN","Telecommunication control","Cellular networks","Routing","Telecommunication traffic","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","code division multiple access","probability","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-hop-relay WCDMA cellular systems","downlink transmission rate","call blocking probability","congestion control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Two-Hop-Relay WCDMA Cellular Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046286","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Two-Hop-Relay WCDMA Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058444S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339963,"authors":[{"name":"Yueheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Computer and Information Engineering College, Hohai University, HHU, China"],"firstName":"Yueheng","lastName":"Li","id":"38181499300"},{"name":"Xijun Yan","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Computer and Information Engineering College, Hohai University, HHU, China"],"firstName":"Xijun","lastName":"Yan","id":"37712276300"},{"name":"Xinghui Yin","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Computer and Information Engineering College, Hohai University, HHU, China"],"firstName":"Xinghui","lastName":"Yin","id":"37716065800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339963","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Downlink","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Equalizers","Access protocols","3G mobile communication","Intersymbol interference","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","equalisers","fast Fourier transforms","least mean squares methods","telecommunication traffic","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE-BLE-SD detector","division synchronization code division multiple access","international protocols","3rd generation mobile communication systems","joint detection","multiple access interference","inter- symbol interference","multipath propagation","spreading factor","zero-forcing block linear equalizer","minimum mean squared error block linear equalizer for single user detection","fast Fourier transform","FFT","voice traffic","TD-SCDMA system"]}],"abstract":"Time division - synchronization code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) is one of the international protocols for the 3rd generation mobile communication systems. One of its key features is the so-called joint detection (JD), which is adopted to combat the serious multiple access interference (MAI) and inter- symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation in the case of a short spreading factor (SF). The normally used JD algorithm in TD-SCDMA receiver is zero-forcing block linear equalizer (ZF-BLE), which is a little complex to implement. In this paper, a new candidate algorithm, i.e. MMSE-BLE-SD (minimum mean squared error block linear equalizer for single user detection), which could be implemented with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), is considered and performance analyzed in the TD- SCDMA linklevel simulation platform. The results show that this less complex detector could provide improved performance than the current used ZF-BLE in the case of 12.2k bit/s voice traffic.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.188","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339963.pdf","startPage":"727","endPage":"730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation Performance of MMSE-BLE-SD Detector in the Downlink of TD-SCDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339963/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation Performance of MMSE-BLE-SD Detector in the Downlink of TD-SCDMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046287","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339963/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation Performance of MMSE-BLE-SD Detector in the Downlink of TD-SCDMA System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068414S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339970,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangning Fan","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Xiangning","lastName":"Fan","id":"37555552400"},{"name":"Hui Zhao","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37088052928"},{"name":"Xiaodong Zhang","firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291973900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339970","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"abstract":"According to the channel's fading characteristics, power control, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), and auto request retransmission (ARQ) techniques for link adaptive are systematically studied for OFDM-based wireless systems in this paper.

The advantage of OVTDM over QAM in OFDM becomes more and more obvious with the increase of the spectral efficiency.

In this paper, an improved scheme is proposed to accommodate to this condition on the basis that system structure is not modified and for the sake of minimizing performance loss. In the proposed algorithm, proportional fair and round robin are combined so that system can work and throughput can be guaranteed.

We show that HSUPA with 4-antenna BF receiver achieves more than 3 dB gain over traditional 2-antenna receiver in sector throughput and more than 6 dB decrease in UE transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.202","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339977.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.202","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","startPage":"783","endPage":"786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the Potential Benefit of Beamforming in HSUPA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Research on the Potential Benefit of Beamforming in HSUPA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339977/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339977/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046301","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the Potential Benefit of Beamforming in HSUPA","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044034S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339979,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Optics & Materials, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405982500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339979","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Quality of service","Scheduling algorithm","Computational modeling","Real time systems","Downlink","Bit rate","Delay","Adaptive optics","Optical materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","optimisation","quality of service","scheduling","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["priority-based resource allocation","OFDMA systems","QoS","real time services","nonreal-time services","subchannel allocation","packet scheduling","integrated cross-layer approach","computational complexity","linear optimization problem","spectral efficiency","traditional TDMA algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of adaptive radio resource allocation and QoS provisioning for real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT) services in OFDMA systems. The proposed algorithm tightly couples the subchannel allocation and packet scheduling together through an integrated cross-layer approach in which each packet is assigned a priority value by taking both the instantaneous channel condition and the QoS requirements into account. An efficient suboptimal algorithm with low computational complexity is proposed to solve the linear optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly improve the system performance in terms of high spectral efficiency and low outage probability compared to the traditional TDMA algorithm, thus is very suitable for the downlink of current OFDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.204","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339979.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","startPage":"791","endPage":"794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority-Based Resource Allocation for RT and NRT Traffics in OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Priority-Based Resource Allocation for RT and NRT Traffics in OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339979/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046303","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4339979/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priority-Based Resource Allocation for RT and NRT Traffics in OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071293S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339985,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Jun Li","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xue Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37065191500"},{"name":"Peter H.J.

In this paper, we propose to use dedicated information ports (DIPs) as clusterheads for cMCN and develop a multihop dynamic channel assignment (mDCA) scheme, including two different channel searching strategies. The mDCA is based on the idea of assigning channels with the knowledge of the information of interference in surrounding cells. A channel reassignment procedure is also investigated. Simulations show that mDCA is able to achieve significant capacity improvement in terms of call blocking as compared to the FCA for cMCN and the FCA for single-hop cellular networks. Furthermore, mDCA has a huge capacity to alleviate the blocking due to the hot-spot traffic.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Channel Assignment Scheme for TDMA-Based Multihop Cellular Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.210","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339985.pdf","startPage":"815","endPage":"818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Channel Assignment Scheme for TDMA-Based Multihop Cellular Networks","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339985/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046309","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Channel Assignment Scheme for TDMA-Based Multihop Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083439S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339986,"authors":[{"name":"Suquan Ding","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Suquan","lastName":"Ding","id":"37287881100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339986","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339986","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Belief propagation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Parity check codes","Iterative algorithms","AWGN","Algorithm design and analysis","Performance gain","Turbo codes","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","orthogonal codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","L-step majority-logic decodable codes","belief propagation","orthogonal Tanner graph","decoding algorithm"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Decoding of L-step Majority-Logic Decodable Codes Based on Belief Propagation","startPage":"819","endPage":"821","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.211","abstract":"Iterative decoding of L-step Majority-Logic decodable (LSMLD) codes based on belief propagation (BP) is presented.

The classic approach of spectral averaging is applied. However, the proposed approach, referred to as unitarily interpolated array minimum variance distortionless response (UIA-MVDR), is distinguished by imposing a unitary constraint on the transform matrix. It releases the restriction on the order of Bessel function expansion so that very accurate array manifold approximation can be achieved even in the case of small or middle arrays. Compared with many related approaches, UIA-MVDR destroys the correlation more completely and then achieves better performance. Its excellent performance is confirmed via a number of numerical examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","accessionNumber":"10046318","htmlLink":"/document/4339994/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Adaptive Beamforming Using UIA-MVDR Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Adaptive Beamforming Using UIA-MVDR Algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074742S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339996,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37716912700"},{"name":"Zhigang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37714693300"},{"name":"Hongmei Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongmei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37711524200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339996","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"A blind adaptive multiuser detector for signal demodulation in multipath code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communication channels is proposed. This detector is based on a modified constrained Kalman filtering Algorithm. In order to facilitate the application of a blind linear filter-optimization technique to robust inference suppression, a new canonical representation for Kalman filter is developed first, and then an efficient iterative implementation that provides very fast convergence under this representation is proposed. The proposed algorithm is low in computation complexity, especially suitable for fast optimization of filter vector with short data samples. And also it has a better tracking capability under a dynamic environment where the number of users will change frequently with time. Computer simulation results, along with some analytical convergence results, confirm that the proposed algorithm is effective in multipath fading channels and achieves very satisfactory performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4339774/4339775/04339996.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"861","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/WICOM.2007.221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICOM.2007.221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4339775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4339996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Adaptive Kalman Filter-Based Multiuser Detector in Multipath CDMA Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Adaptive filters","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Nonlinear filters","Convergence","Adaptive signal detection","Signal detection","Demodulation","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filters","code division multiple access","demodulation","fading channels","interference suppression","multipath channels","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind adaptive Kalman filter","multiuser detector","signal demodulation","multipath code-division multiple-access communication channel","blind linear filter-optimization","inference suppression","computation complexity","filter vector","multipath fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4339996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Blind Adaptive Kalman Filter-Based Multiuser Detector in Multipath CDMA Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4339996/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10046320","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Adaptive Kalman Filter-Based Multiuser Detector in Multipath CDMA Channels","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053478S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4339774","isNumber":"4339775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4339774","xplore-issue":"4339775","articleId":"4339996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4339997,"authors":[{"name":"Luo Zhinian","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Hunan University, Changsha, China","Institute of Image Communication and Information Processing, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Luo","lastName":"Zhinian","id":"37706230400"},{"name":"Zhang Wenjun","affiliation":["Institute of Image Communication and Information Processing, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Wenjun","id":"37272675100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1312-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4339997","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"This paper proposes an improved channel estimation method based on B.
