The algorithm tracks the subspaces corresponding to clusters of eigenvalues of the auto-correlation matrix of the input to the adaptive filter, which have the same order of magnitude. The algorithm updates the projection of the tap weights of the adaptive filter onto each subspace using LMS algorithms with different step sizes. The technique also permits adaptation only in those subspaces, which contain strong signal components leading to a lower excess mean squared error (MSE) as compared to traditional algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

We use Lagrange polynomials for interpolating the values of the signal between sampling instants. It is shown that to deploy this technique effectively one has to use polynomials of high degree. Otherwise the interpolation error for high frequencies (above half Nyquist) is very big. Increasing the polynomial's degree leads inevitably to numerical problems. The interpolation process may be improved when additional samples of the signal are generated before interpolation. It is shown that FSD can be used for achieving this task. The final version of the sampling rate converter comprises two FSDs and a very simple four-point interpolator based on a Lagrange polynomial.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4929216","volume":"iii","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling rate conversion using fractional-sample delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling rate conversion using fractional-sample delay","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00390042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028964S","chronDate":"19-22 Apr 1994","isNumber":"8838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3104","citationCount":"10","articleId":"390042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":390047,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Therefore, the idea is to use a fast DSP microprocessor that can implement the recursive equation in \"real-time\". This technique guarantees a larger set of output frequencies, a high spectral purity and a very simple, compact, and reliable hardware design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.390055","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

The method is based on the use of decorrelation as a signal separation criterion. It is proven analytically that decorrelating the output signals at different time lags is sufficient provided that the normalised autocorrelation functions of the source signals are sufficiently distinct. The method involves an iterative least-squares solution of a set of nonlinear equations. Alternatively, a gradient search algorithm can also be used to find the minimum of the sum of squares of these equations. Both time- and frequency-domain formulations are given.

This paper brings two novel contributions (i) a novel algorithm as proposed in order to adaptively maximise Comon's contrast. However it requires a preprocessing whitening operation which is awkward when the mixture is ill-conditioned. (ii) A new criterion is defined that is free of the prewhitening step. In the case of two sources it can be proved that this criterion is a contrast. This contrast can also be adaptively maximized and has the additional advantage not to require identical signs for the fourth-order cumulants of the sources. Achievement of these two adaptive algorithms is demonstrated using a new performance index.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1994.390093","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICASSP '94.

HDTV is already broadcast daily in Japan and advanced television (ATV) standards will soon be established in the US. The hardware systems for two HDTV systems, the 1125/60 and 1250/50 systems, have already been developed. Their outlines are described in the paper. Signal processing of HDTV is mainly carried out by digital methods on both the studio and receiver sides. The principles of processing are the same as for conventional television but the higher clock frequency and larger quantity of information require more sophisticated hardware. Digital signal processing methods are the key technology in HDTV broadcasting systems regardless of whether modulation is analog or digital. Some broadcasting systems are already practical use while others, are experimental. The author discusses these systems. The aim of the article is to present a global scope of the HDTV technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.390125","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/8839/00390125.pdf","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.390125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High definition television systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390125","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390125/","displayDocTitle":"High definition television systems","volume":"83","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5003052","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High definition television systems","sourcePdf":"00390125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033469S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"6","articleId":"390125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":390151,"authors":[{"name":"W.G.

This in turn leads to distinct advantages over labor intensive wire wound components: improved reliability, repeatability, accuracy and consequential cost reductions. This paper establishes a new set of formulas for the self and mutual impedances of planar coils on ferromagnetic substrates. A planar coil in air is a special case of the generalized formulas. The formulas are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and therefore serve as a useful yardstick for simpler approximations. The formulas take full account of the current density distribution in the coil cross-section and the eddy current losses in the substrate. Experimental and calculated impedances up to 100 MHz are presented for a four layer device with three turns per layer which is 150 /spl mu/m thick and 40 mm/sup 2/ in area.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.390151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8841/00390151.pdf","startPage":"2416","endPage":"2422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.390151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of self and mutual impedances in planar magnetic structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390151/","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of self and mutual impedances in planar magnetic structures","volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5000890","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of self and mutual impedances in planar magnetic structures","sourcePdf":"00390151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028253S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"190","articleId":"390151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390157,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The amplitude of the wire voltage decreased by 40% at 1 MHz, 60% (600 kHz) and 50% (150 kHz), for wires having diameters 30 /spl mu/m, 50 /spl mu/m and 124 /spl mu/m, respectively, under the influence of an external longitudinal field of about 10 Oe (800 A/m). A highly sensitive and quick-response field sensor was constructed using a 200 MHz resonant multivibrator bridge-circuit combining two MI-effect elements of 1 mm length with two field effect transistors (FET). Highly sensitive flux detection was carried out by using the small MI sensor head on a rotary encoder magnet having 512 poles and a diameter of 30 mm.

This high fidelity system has a bandwidth of 100-GHz, time resolution of 4-ps and a measurement sensitivity of 5-/spl mu/V//spl radic/(Hz). Because of this high sensitivity capability, the magnitude of the testing signal can be maintained sufficiently small to allow network analysis of a device or circuit in the linear mode without signal distortion. In this paper, a linear time-domain network analysis of a broadband monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifier has been demonstrated in real-time by the optoelectronic technique. A measurement time of less than 40 /spl mu/s is used to acquire waveform data. The dynamic range of the system can be further improved to 40 dB by reducing the repetition rate of the step recovery diode. Since the PC switches are fabricated with processes compatible to MMIC manufacturing, this real-time system is well-suited for on-wafer MMIC characterization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","MMICs","Real time systems","Distortion measurement","Time measurement","Circuit testing","Gallium arsenide","Photoconductivity","Optical switches","Optical distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear network analysis","time-domain analysis","photoconducting switches","MMIC amplifiers","integrated circuit measurement","real-time systems","microwave mixers","wideband amplifiers","network analysers","microwave measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear time-domain network analysis","picosecond photoconductive mixer","ion-implanted photoconductive switches","optical-microwave frequency mixer","electrical waveform samplers","real-time sampling system","broadband monolithic microwave integrated circuit","MMIC amplifier","waveform data","repetition rate","step recovery diode","on-wafer MMIC characterization","100 GHz","4 ps","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.390184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8842/00390184.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.390184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time linear time-domain network analysis using picosecond photoconductive mixer and samplers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time linear time-domain network analysis using picosecond photoconductive mixer and samplers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390184/","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4994591","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time linear time-domain network analysis using picosecond photoconductive mixer and samplers","sourcePdf":"00390184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032221S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"390184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390185,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The rigorous CAD is a combination of the mode-matching and the finite-element techniques, which permits obtaining the Generalized Scattering Matrix for all the blocks that compose the structure (rectangular slots, cross-irises, and screws). The finite thickness of the irises, the higher order mode interaction, as well as the coupling and tuning screws are rigorously taken into account. A systematic design process for the different elements is described. A full prediction of resonant out-of-band spurious modes is accomplished prior to the filter construction. Special attention is devoted to the circuital model in order to save a great deal of computational effort in the final adjustment. A four-pole elliptic circular waveguide cavity filter has been designed and constructed. The experimental filter results show excellent agreement with theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8842/00390185.pdf","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.390185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.390185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-wave design and realization of multicoupled dual-mode circular waveguide filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Fasteners","Design methodology","Design automation","Finite element methods","Scattering","Transmission line matrix methods","Waveguide discontinuities","Coupling circuits","Circuit optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled circuits","circular waveguides","cavity resonators","mode matching","finite element analysis","microwave filters","circuit CAD","S-matrix theory","elliptic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-wave design","multicoupled dual-mode circular waveguide filters","mode-matching techniques","finite-element techniques","CAD","generalized scattering matrix","cross-irises","higher order mode interaction","resonant out-of-band spurious modes","four-pole elliptic cavity filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Full-wave design and realization of multicoupled dual-mode circular waveguide filters","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4994592","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-wave design and realization of multicoupled dual-mode circular waveguide filters","sourcePdf":"00390185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034816S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"62","articleId":"390185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390193,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

This paper presents a new approach to microwave circuit optimization and statistical design featuring neural network models at either device or circuit levels. At the device level, the neural network represents a physics-oriented FET model yet without the need to solve device physics equations repeatedly during optimization. At the circuit level, the neural network speeds up optimization by replacing repeated circuit simulations. This method is faster than direct optimization of original device and circuit models. Compared to existing polynomial or table look-up models used in analysis and optimization, the proposed approach has the capability to handle high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8842/00390193.pdf","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.390193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.390193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network modeling approach to circuit optimization and statistical design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Circuit optimization","Microwave FETs","Coupling circuits","Physics computing","Microwave devices","Microwave circuits","Equations","Circuit simulation","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave circuits","circuit optimisation","circuit CAD","circuit analysis computing","statistical analysis","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network modeling","highly nonlinear problems","statistical design","physics-based FET models","yield optimization","microwave circuit optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"A neural network modeling approach to circuit optimization and statistical design","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4994601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network modeling approach to circuit optimization and statistical design","sourcePdf":"00390193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038551S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"206","articleId":"390193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390196,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The requirement for greater interconnection capabilities, spawned in part by the advances in integrated circuit technologies and the need for enhanced digital services, dictate that technology advancement must occur in traditional electronic packaging and/or interconnection techniques. The resolution of these technological needs is paramount for the successful competitive introduction of these systems. Presently, a \"bottle-neck\" occurs at the board-to-board level of the interconnection hierarchy. Therefore, an opportunity exists for the development of new optical interconnection techniques which can be incorporated into system designs beginning at this interconnection level and beyond. The strategic insertion of optical interconnection technology into these electronic processing systems not only meets projected performance requirements, but potentially offers them at a competitive cost. This paper describes some of the new optical strategies switching equipment designers are incorporating into today's products. These strategies range from optical data links to an implementation of a flexible optical backplane called OptiFlex.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5000506","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Advanced optical interconnection technology in switching equipment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced optical interconnection technology in switching equipment","sourcePdf":"00390216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030083S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"53","articleId":"390216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":390217,"authors":[{"name":"Yiu-Man Wong","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Labaratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Yiu-Man Wong","id":"37087428792"},{"name":"D.J.

The main components of the transmitter and the receiver modules are a GaAs-based vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) array at 850 mn with its IC driver array chip and an integrated metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) receiver (photodetector and signal processing circuits) array at 850 nm. The package module uses a modified 164 I/O JEDEC premolded plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) in combination with a polymer film integrated circuit (POLYFIC) chip carrier. The electrical input and output are 500 Mb/s NRZ binary signals. The optical I/O in both modules consists of a directly-connectorized (nonpigtail) fiber array block that plugs into the 32/spl times/1 optical fiber ribbon directly on one side and accepts 32 optical signals from the SEL array or delivers them to the MSM receiver array via a gold-coated 45/spl deg/ polished fiber array mirror. The MACII-32 ribbon cable is an enhanced version of the standard MACII connector ribbon cable. This paper characterizes key components of the optical data link, describes its package design, and discusses preliminary component and optical data link test results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technology development of a high-density 32-channel 16-Gb/s optical data link for optical interconnection applications for the optoelectronic technology consortium (OETC)","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.390217","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8843/00390217.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"1016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.390217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Technology development of a high-density 32-channel 16-Gb/s optical data link for optical interconnection applications for the optoelectronic technology consortium (OETC)","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5000507","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology development of a high-density 32-channel 16-Gb/s optical data link for optical interconnection applications for the optoelectronic technology consortium (OETC)","sourcePdf":"00390217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095889S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"93","articleId":"390217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390222,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The vertical optical interconnections are realized using. Integrated optoelectronic devices operating at wavelengths to which silicon is transparent. These through-wafer optical signals are used to vertically optically interconnect stacked silicon circuits. The thin film optoelectronic devices are bonded directly to the stacked layers of silicon circuitry to realize self-contained vertical optical interconnections. Each integrated circuit layer contains analog interface circuitry, namely, detector amplifier and emitter driver circuitry, and digital circuitry for the network and/or processor, all of which are fabricated using a standard silicon integrated circuit foundry. These silicon circuits are post processed to integrate the thin film optoelectronics using standard, low cost, high yield microfabrication techniques. The three-dimensionally integrated architectures described herein are a network and a processor. The network has been designed to meet off-chip I/O using a new offset cube topology coupled with naming and renting schemes. The performance of this network is comparable to that of a three-dimensional mesh. The processing architecture has been defined to minimize overhead for basic parallel operations. The system goal for this research is to develop an integrated processing node for high-throughput, low-memory applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390224/","volume":"13","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5000514","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A three-dimensional high-throughput architecture using through-wafer optical interconnect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-dimensional high-throughput architecture using through-wafer optical interconnect","sourcePdf":"00390224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055952S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"20","articleId":"390224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":390227,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

However, there has been little discussion of any renting methodologies besides those already used in electronics. In this paper, a neural network routing methodology is proposed that can generate control bits for a broad range of optical multistage interconnection networks (OMIN's). Though we present no optical implementation of this methodology, we illustrate its control for an optical interconnection network. These OMIN's can be used as communication media for distributed computing systems. The routing methodology makes use of an artificial neural network (ANN) that functions as a parallel computer for generating the routes. The neural network routing scheme can be applied to electrical as well as optical interconnection networks. However, since the ANN can be implemented using optics, this routing approach is especially appealing for an optical computing environment. Although the ANN does not always generate the best solution, the parallel nature of the ANN computation may make this routing scheme faster than conventional routing approaches, especially for OMIN's that have an irregular structure. Furthermore, the ANN router is fault-tolerant. Results are shown for generating routes in a 16/spl times/16, 3-stage OMIN.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.390227","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8843/00390227.pdf","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1115","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.390227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing in optical multistage interconnection networks: a neural network solution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Routing in optical multistage interconnection networks: a neural network solution","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5000517","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing in optical multistage interconnection networks: a neural network solution","sourcePdf":"00390227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034034S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","articleId":"390227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":390228,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

When the dispersion of the fiber varies from one amplifier spacing to another amplifier spacing, the maximum bit rate is significantly reduced. To overcome the effect, the amplitude of the soliton is amplified so that it is still the average soliton corresponding to the fiber dispersion for an amplifier spacing. Thus, the maximum bit rate is only slightly less than that without the dispersion variations. For a given distance, the maximum bit rate limited by the stability and soliton interaction is obtained. The result is compared with that limited by the Gordon-Haus effect. For shorter transmission distance, the maximum bit rate is limited by the stability and soliton interaction.

The variance is similarly altered, and the excess amplifier noise is greater at the leading side of the pulse.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5000520","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-statistical properties of pulse amplification in optical fibers with gain saturation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-statistical properties of pulse amplification in optical fibers with gain saturation","sourcePdf":"00390230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038594S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","articleId":"390230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":390231,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.

A realistic and general model of a classical photodetector/amplifier receiver is considered. Optimum decision strategies and corresponding receiver sensitivities are derived both for single-pulse detection and for continuous digital communication in which the intersymbol interference is constrained to be zero. A comparison is made to the classic work of Personick and Smith. Their results are shown to be remarkably close to the fundamental limits at high bit rates. At low bit rates, the optimal filter for small duty-cycle pulses gives much better performance than the filters analyzed by Personick and Smith. Optimum values for the Personick integrals are also given. Results are given for a number of cases of practical importance including a photodiode/FET receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical pulses","Optical detectors","Optical receivers","Bit rate","Filters","Decision theory","Photodetectors","Optical amplifiers","Pulse amplifiers","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photodetectors","fibre lasers","intersymbol interference","sensitivity","statistical analysis","digital communication","decision theory","optical receivers","optical noise","photodiodes","modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fundamental limits","optical pulse detection","digital communication","statistical decision theory","direct detection","optical pulses","photodetector/amplifier receiver","optimum decision strategies","receiver sensitivities","single-pulse detection","continuous digital communication","intersymbol interference","high bit rates","optimal filter","small duty-cycle pulses","Personick integrals","photodiode/FET receiver"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.390231","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8843/00390231.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.390231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental limits on optical pulse detection and digital communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental limits on optical pulse detection and digital communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390231/","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5000521","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental limits on optical pulse detection and digital communication","sourcePdf":"00390231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0277S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","articleId":"390231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":390233,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This paper proposes to average the FDM-channel loss over the cascaded multiplexers by shifting port connections between each adjacent multiplexer. A simulation predicts that, in a cascade of M periodic N/spl times/N multiplexers, shifting the connections by N/M reduces the loss imbalance from M/spl Delta//spl alpha/ to /spl Delta//spl alpha//M where /spl Delta//spl alpha/ [dB] denotes the loss imbalance per multiplexer. This improvement will extend the cascadable node number in all-optical FDM networks. The prediction is confirmed experimentally in an optical add-drop filter (M=2) constructed with a silica-based AWG 16/spl times/16 multiplexer; the largest loss difference among 15 FDM channels is reduced from 5.0 dB to 1.5 dB. This paper also reports that imperfect multiplexer periodicity due to waveguide dispersion restricts the equalizable frequency bandwidth to less than several free spectral ranges (FSR's).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss-imbalance equalization in arrayed waveguide-grating (AWG) multiplexer cascades","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.390233","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8843/00390233.pdf","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.390233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Loss-imbalance equalization in arrayed waveguide-grating (AWG) multiplexer cascades","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5000523","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss-imbalance equalization in arrayed waveguide-grating (AWG) multiplexer cascades","sourcePdf":"00390233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039848S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"23","articleId":"390233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":390234,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Feed-forward multilayered networks are considered; the performance taken into account with respect to error sensitivity is their classification capacity. The final aim is evaluation of the probability that a single neuron's error will affect both its own classification capacity and that of the whole network. A geometrical representation of the neural computation is adopted as the basis for such evaluation. Probability of error propagation is evaluated with respect to the single neuron's output as well as to the complete network's output. The information derived is used to evaluate, for a specific digital network architecture, the most critical sections of the implementation as far as reliability is concerned and thus to point out candidates for ad-hoc fault-tolerance policies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/8845/00390269.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity to errors in artificial neural networks: a behavioral approach","doi":"10.1109/81.390269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.390269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity to errors in artificial neural networks: a behavioral approach","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4996152","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity to errors in artificial neural networks: a behavioral approach","sourcePdf":"00390269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090358S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"50","articleId":"390269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390274,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This complex and delicate device requires effective encapsulation and packaging to ensure its long-term reliability. This device encapsulant requires not only excellent electrical and physical properties, but also suitable mechanical properties for hostile and extreme temperature cycling requirements (from -65/spl deg/ to 150/spl deg/C). Hence, the mechanical and thermal behavior of the encapsulant plays a critical role in device reliability. Low stress encapsulants are the preferred choice for microelectronic packaging. Silicone-based materials, either the elastomers or gels, with their low modulus and excellent electrical properties, are the best encapsulants. However, the intrinsic low modulus silicone provides weak mechanic protection for the IC device. We have, however, modified the silicone material with a high loading of silica to improve its mechanical and physical properties. This high-silica filler loading material improves not only its mechanical property, but also its modulus. Furthermore, this modified high modulus silicone material tends to have microcracks during the high temperature thermal cycling testing that generates the device reliability problem. In this paper, we will describe a modified version of the thermal-mechanical enhanced silicone-based encapsulant, its material formulation, curing process, thermal mechanical failure and its protecting mechanisms, and its application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/8847/00390302.pdf","doi":"10.1109/95.390302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.390302","startPage":"270","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-mechanical enhanced high-performance silicone gels and elastomeric encapsulants in microelectronic packaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390302/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-mechanical enhanced high-performance silicone gels and elastomeric encapsulants in microelectronic packaging","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4999836","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-mechanical enhanced high-performance silicone gels and elastomeric encapsulants in microelectronic packaging","sourcePdf":"00390302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040515S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"13","articleId":"390302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390309,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Since August 1992, copper wire bonding has been used in production at National Semiconductor Corp. The development of copper wire ball bonding involves a three-prong approach: optimum pad metal composition, modifications to the wire bonder and optimization of the assembly parameters. the critical material parameter is bond pad hardness. This needs to be above a critical threshold value to avoid silicon cratering. The metal composition best suited for the wire bonding process is sputtered Al-Cu(2%). Typical production yields of 99.8% at lead bond are obtained with 1.5 mil (37.5 /spl mu/m) copper wires, with ball shear and wire pull averaging 100/spl plusmn/20 gms and 15/spl plusmn/2 gms, respectively. Five issues related to copper wire bonding of TO-22 power IC packages are discussed: 1) typical bonding failure modes; 2) the relation between bond pad composition and hardness; 3) the influence of the metal deposition systems; 4) the optimization of bonding conditions; 5) the reliability of the copper wire bonded devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/95.390327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/8847/00390327.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.390327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of copper wire bonding on Al-Cu metallization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390327/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of copper wire bonding on Al-Cu metallization","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4999859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of copper wire bonding on Al-Cu metallization","sourcePdf":"00390327.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036094S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"61","articleId":"390327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390329,"authors":[{"name":"Jan-Ho Jean","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jan-Ho Jean","id":"37654419400"},{"name":"T.K.

With added gallium oxide content greater than a critical value, the cristobalite formation in the borosilicate glass is completely prevented at the sintering temperatures investigated, and the critical gallium oxide content increases with decreasing sintering temperature. The above result, similar to that observed in Al/sub 2/O/sub 3//borosilicate glass system, is attributed to a strong coupling between Ga/sup +3/ from Ga/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and Na/sup +/ from borosilicate glass. The observed coupling reaction causes segregation of Na/sup +/ in borosilicate glass to gallium oxide, thus forming a Na/sup +/ and Ga/sup +3/-rich reaction layer around gallium oxide particles at a rate which prevents formation of cristobalite.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/8847/00390329.pdf","doi":"10.1109/95.390329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.390329","startPage":"438","endPage":"443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of gallium oxide on crystallization and thermal expansion behavior of low k glass composite","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390329/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of gallium oxide on crystallization and thermal expansion behavior of low k glass composite","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4999861","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of gallium oxide on crystallization and thermal expansion behavior of low k glass composite","sourcePdf":"00390329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044865S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"1","articleId":"390329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":390345,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We propose a unified approach that deals with state assignment, optimization and mapping problems and that takes the target architecture into account during all the phases of the synthesis. This approach is made possible by very fast FPGA mapping techniques based on multi-ROBDD representation (Shared, Reduced and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams). A prototype has been developed for FSM synthesis on Xilinx X3090 and Actel ACT1 architectures. Given a FSM description in VHDL or KISS format, it directly generates a look-up table (LUT) network for Xilinx or a multiplexor-based (MB) network for Actel. The results are promising and have been obtained within reasonable computing time. Comparisons have been made with the traditional approach implemented by Sis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EURMIC.1994.390345","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Twentieth Euromicro Conference.

Some other good properties of neural networks such as generalization and fault tolerance are only be taken as side effects of neural networks. In this paper we define another energy term called constraint energy to be optimized. The role of constraint energy in the training phase is to control the fault tolerant property of neural networks. Incorporated with normal energy and constraint energy we can find out a set of weights that guarantee some degree of fault tolerance in any hidden node failure. Experimental results indicate that networks trained by fault tolerant constraints possess better generalization properties than those trained by normal backpropagation. The mechanism of training with constraint energy proposed here has the tendency to force the nodes to leave out the linear region, thus reducing the sensitivity of links and nodes. Constraint energy can be extended to tolerant multiple nodes failure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EURMIC.1994.390347","startPage":"644","endPage":"650","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Twentieth Euromicro Conference.

Some models are better represented by changes in their structure. Instead of forcing this changes to be represented at the simple behavioral level, a strong theoretical support is needed to allow the representation of structural changes in a natural way. We present a modeling methodology for representing variable structure systems. Examples of such systems include adaptive computer architectures, ecological systems, fault tolerating computers. We describe an application of this methodology to the modeling and simulation of an adaptive computer architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4891597","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Variable DEVS-variable structure modeling formalism: an adaptive computer architecture application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable DEVS-variable structure modeling formalism: an adaptive computer architecture application","confLoc":"Gainesville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00390474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034713S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 1994","isNumber":"8849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3106","citationCount":"8","articleId":"390474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":390528,"authors":[{"name":"M.

If they are able to know move about the capacity of neural networks, they would have an easier time deciding what neural network architecture to use as well as how many hidden neurons are needed for a neural network to perform a given function. Knowing the best architecture saves time with training, and allow for less expensive circuitry. The paper is a review of what neural network architectures are necessary to perform certain functions. There are two neural network architectures considered: (1) multilayer, multiple output feedforward, (2) multilayer, single output feedforward. The objectives are to examine the advantages of each network and to prove or disprove the following fact: that a single bit per output neural network uses less overall neurons to perform the same function as a multilayered network.

Fuzzy logic has emerged as a mathematical tool to deal with the uncertainties in human perception and reasoning. It also provides a framework for an inference mechanism that allows for approximate human reasoning capabilities to be applied to knowledge-based systems. On the other hand, artificial neural networks have emerged as fast computation tools with learning and adaptivity capabilities. Recently, these two fields have been integrated into a new emerging technology called fuzzy neural networks which combines the benefits of each field. The objective of the paper is to establish the similarities and differences between fuzzy systems and neural networks and to discuss possible models for fuzzy neural networks which can be applied to system modeling and control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1995.390573","startPage":"258","endPage":"262","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3107/8850/00390573.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1995.390573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic for system modeling and control: a comparative study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Modeling","Humans","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Uncertainty","Inference mechanisms","Knowledge based systems","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy logic","uncertainty handling","inference mechanisms","fuzzy control","intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","fuzzy logic","system modeling","system control","uncertainties","human perception","inference mechanism","approximate human reasoning","knowledge-based systems","fast computation tools","adaptivity capabilities","fuzzy neural networks","fuzzy systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic for system modeling and control: a comparative study","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 March 1995","accessionNumber":"4917814","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic for system modeling and control: a comparative study","confLoc":"Starkville, MS, USA","sourcePdf":"00390573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030903S","chronDate":"12-14 Mar 1995","isNumber":"8850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3107","citationCount":"2","articleId":"390573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":390683,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

The essence of the approach adopted was to use a neural network model of the inverse dynamics of a plant to control that plant. A control system is described which comprises a control section, a training section, an error prediction mechanism, and am adaptation assessment mechanism (a critic). The control section, which is a neural network (/spl Phi//spl circ//sup C/), is placed in series with the controlled plant, /spl Phi//spl circ//sup C/ is a recurrent backpropagation, neural network. It is a direct copy of /spl Phi//spl circ/, also a recurrent backpropagation network, which is positioned across the plant to learn its inverse dynamics during operation. /spl Phi//spl circ//sup C/ generates control signals to the plant, taking as its inputs the desired plant output and the feedback error. The latter is produced by the error prediction mechanism to compensate for discrepancies between the desired and actual outputs due to inverse modelling uncertainties and varying environments. The control performance assessment mechanism is employed to ensure that the performance of the control system improves when the weights of /spl Phi//spl circ//sup C/ are updated. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to adaptive tracking control problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390690/","accessionNumber":"4911082","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of dynamic systems using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of dynamic systems using neural networks","confLoc":"Le Touquet, France","sourcePdf":"00390690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039868S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3093","citationCount":"4","articleId":"390690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":390695,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To improve this condition, a multiresolution basis transfer scheme based on the wavelet transform is proposed. The effect of the basis transfer is to transform the original interpolation basis into two sets of bases with larger supports while the admissible solution space remains unchanged. With this transfer, a new set of nodal variables results, and an equivalent equation system with a better convergence condition can be solved. The basis transfer can be easily implemented by using a QMF (quadrature mirror filter banks) matrix pair associated with the chosen interpolation basis. The consequence of the basis transfer scheme can be regarded as a preconditioner to the subsequent iterative computation method. As compared with other acceleration methods, this basis transfer scheme provides a more systematic approach for fast surface interpolation. The easy implementation and high flexibility of the proposed algorithm also make it applicable to various regularization problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1993.390767","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","pdfPath":"/iel2/3093/8852/00390767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1993.390767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8852","startPage":"523","endPage":"528 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast surface interpolation using multi-resolution wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast surface interpolation using multi-resolution wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390767/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4911115","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast surface interpolation using multi-resolution wavelet transform","confLoc":"Le Touquet, France","sourcePdf":"00390767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036488S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3093","articleId":"390767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":390770,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Using optical phenomena, the developed tactile sensor, which has a hemispherical surface, can detect the point where an object contacts the sensor surface and the normal to the surface of the contacted object. The primary element of the tactile sensor is a hemispherical optical waveguide made of a glass shell. Light is injected at the edge of the waveguide to illuminate the interior. The injected light maintains total internal reflection at the inner surface of the waveguide and is enclosed within it. Therefore light scatters when an object contacts the surface of the waveguide, because of the changing reflection conditions. A prototype finger-shaped tactile sensor was developed to confirm the feasibility of this principle. Next, a miniaturized version was developed, and its tactile-sensing capability was experimentally evaluated. Through further miniaturization and integration, a fingertip diameter of 20 mm has been achieved in the latest fingertip-size version of the tactile sensor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A finger-shaped tactile sensor using an optical waveguide","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1993.390885","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference - SMC","pdfPath":"/iel2/3093/8853/00390885.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"408 vol.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1993.390885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=390885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/390885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A finger-shaped tactile sensor using an optical waveguide","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4904697","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finger-shaped tactile sensor using an optical waveguide","confLoc":"Le Touquet, France","sourcePdf":"00390885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042012S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3093","citationCount":"22","articleId":"390885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391040,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It produces 100-W average output power of pulsed light with an almost diffraction limited beam. The Q-switched system works with an average repetition rate of about 3 kHz and the pulse width was 70 ns. As active material we used Nd:YALO (Nd:YAP) which has negligible depolarization. The strong thermal lens of the material with focal lengths of less than 15 cm at pump powers of 8 kW was compensated by a phase conjugating mirror based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). Therefore, the output power could be varied from 2 W up to 100 W without changing the transversal beam profile.

The so obtained results are compared with those drawn from the study of linear-polarization EO amplitude modulators structured as linear polarizer-sample-linear analyzer (LPSA) systems in their optimized variety (45/spl deg/-CLPSA modulators). From this comparison, it is found that a CPSA modulator in its optimized configuration (ACPSA modulator) is superior in EO-modulation sensitivity and considerably more stable against misalignments /spl theta/ than its 45/spl deg/-CLPSA counterpart.

It is designed as an alternative for the, bipolar, amplitude detection in hard disk servo systems. The amplitude is detected by converting the input voltage to a current, rectifying the current, and integrating it on a capacitor. For this a new OTA topology and a rectifier cell are designed. This circuitry is expanded with a very linear current mirror and an automatic offset compensation system to cope with technology spread. The measured accuracy of the amplitude detector is 0.2% (9 b). This makes the circuit suitable for implementation in state-of-the art hard disk systems with very high track densities and very short access times. Because the circuit is realized in standard CMOS it is a further step toward CMOS only hard disk electronics. Because the circuit operates from a single 3 V power supply and has limited power consumption it can be used in battery powered systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hard disks","Servomechanisms","Voltage","Capacitors","Circuit topology","Rectifiers","Mirrors","CMOS technology","Integrated circuit measurements","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","rectifying circuits","integrating circuits","hard discs","servomechanisms","operational amplifiers","detector circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS rectifier-integrator","amplitude detection","hard disk servo loops","OTA topology","rectifier cell","linear current mirror","automatic offset compensation system","track densities","access time","hard disk electronics","power consumption","3 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.391113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8858/00391113.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.391113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS rectifier-integrator for amplitude detection in hard disk servo loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS rectifier-integrator for amplitude detection in hard disk servo loops","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391113/","volume":"30","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5029525","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS rectifier-integrator for amplitude detection in hard disk servo loops","sourcePdf":"00391113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031517S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"32","articleId":"391113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":391115,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The placement tool inherently handles symmetry constraints, circuit loading effects and device mismatches. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with practical circuit examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.391116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8858/00391116.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.391116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance-driven placement tool for analog integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"A performance-driven placement tool for analog integrated circuits","volume":"30","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5029528","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance-driven placement tool for analog integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00391116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043406S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"84","articleId":"391116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391120,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, we present a high-speed VLSI implementation of the soft-output Viterbi algorithm, a low complexity soft-output algorithm, for a 16-state convolutional code. The 43 mm/sup 2/ standard cell chip achieves a simulated throughput of 40 Mb/s, while tested samples achieved a throughput of 50 Mb/s. The chip is roughly twice as big as a 16-state Viterbi decoder without soft outputs. It is thus shown with the design that transmission schemes using soft-output decoding can be considered practical even at very high throughput. Since such decoding systems are more complex to design than hard output systems, special emphasis is placed on the employed design methodology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8858/00391121.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.391121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.391121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 40 Mb/s soft-output Viterbi decoder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Convolutional codes","Signal processing algorithms","Throughput","Very large scale integration","Design methodology","Concatenated codes","Block codes","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Viterbi decoding","error correction codes","VLSI","convolutional codes","cellular arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-output Viterbi decoder","error correction approaches","high-speed VLSI implementation","16-state convolutional code","standard cell chip","simulated throughput","design methodology","40 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"A 40 Mb/s soft-output Viterbi decoder","volume":"30","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5029533","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40 Mb/s soft-output Viterbi decoder","sourcePdf":"00391121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036001S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"17","articleId":"391121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":391124,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.M.

This approach is applicable to nonlinear magnetic materials with or without hysteresis (i.e. time dependence). Problems with geometric details that are very small compared to signal wavelengths, however, stress FDTD techniques. This occurs because the Courant-limited /spl Delta/t can become small enough to require the use of >10/sup 11/ time steps unless one is tricky. Tricky means observing that this sort of problem has a solution which seldom depends on the speed of light c. Here, we demonstrate a procedure to elude the Courant stability condition by defining c to be 100 m/s. The present problem arose out of a magnetic diffusion FDTD application. The \"reduced-c\" technique should work, however, for any problem where /spl Delta/t is limited by /spl Delta/x/c which, in turn, is limited by the smallness of the problem geometry, not by a need for extremely fine temporal electromagnetic resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.391135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8859/00391135.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.391135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD analysis of nonlinear magnetic diffusion by reduced c","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391135/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD analysis of nonlinear magnetic diffusion by reduced c","volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5013032","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD analysis of nonlinear magnetic diffusion by reduced c","sourcePdf":"00391135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05932S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","articleId":"391135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391136,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Suk Oh","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Kyung Suk Oh","id":"38273393100"},{"name":"J.E.

Surface impedance boundary conditions are first formulated for a lossy dielectric half-space in the frequency domain. The impedance function of a lossy medium is approximated with a series of first-order rational functions. Then, the resulting time-domain convolution integrals are computed using recursive formulas which are obtained by assuming that the fields are piecewise linear in time. Thus, the recursive formulas derived here are second-order accurate. Unlike a previously published method [7] which requires preprocessing to compute the exponential approximation prior to the FDTD simulation, the preprocessing time is eliminated by performing a rational approximation on the normalized frequency-domain impedance.

While execution time is becoming less of an impediment when solving large problems, the biggest constraint remains the memory needed to run the FDTD or the FE methods. It is precisely this limitation that the article addresses. A boundary operation is developed to minimize the artificial reflections that arise when truncating the computational domain of an open region scattering or radiation problem. The method is based on the use of two boundary operators that are complementary in their action. By solving the problem with each of the two operators and then averaging the two solutions, the first-order reflections that arise from the artificial boundary can be completely eliminated. Numerical results are presented to show that this new technique gives significant reduction in the error when compared to other widely used boundary conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complementary operators: a method to annihilate artificial reflections arising from the truncation of the computational domain in the solution of partial differential equations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.391141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8859/00391141.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.391141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Complementary operators: a method to annihilate artificial reflections arising from the truncation of the computational domain in the solution of partial differential equations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5013038","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary operators: a method to annihilate artificial reflections arising from the truncation of the computational domain in the solution of partial differential equations","sourcePdf":"00391141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060165S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"40","articleId":"391141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391143,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

A single circularly polarized antenna was used at each end of the link. The objective was to provide information for personal communications satellite uplink power control design on the correlation of tree shadowing between frequencies near 1620 and 2500 MHz. Fade time series obtained simultaneously did not exhibit any significant correlation, but their means were weakly correlated (r/sup 2/ from 0.31 to 0.58). Fades were measured along a 10-m lateral distance with 5-cm spacing. Instantaneous fade differences between L- and S-band exhibited a normal distribution with means usually near 0 dB and standard deviations from 5.2 to 7.5 dB. The cottonwood tree was an exception with 5.4 dB higher average fading at S- than at L-band. More than 90% of the spatial variations occurred with periods larger than 1/spl sim/2 wavelengths. Simultaneous swept measurements over 160-MHz spans showed that the standard deviation of the power levels as function of frequency increased from about 1 dB at locations with mean fades less than 4 dB to near 6 dB at locations with mean fades of 20 dB. For a 5-dB fade, the central 90% of fade slopes were within a band of 0.7 dB/MHz at L- and 1.9 dB/MHz at S-band.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.391143","startPage":"713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8859/00391143.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.391143","endPage":"719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous measurements of L- and S-band tree shadowing for space-Earth communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous measurements of L- and S-band tree shadowing for space-Earth communications","volume":"43","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5013040","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous measurements of L- and S-band tree shadowing for space-Earth communications","sourcePdf":"00391143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049906S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"11","articleId":"391143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391150,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This network is to serve as a controller in an FES system developed by the first author which is presently in use by 300 patients worldwide (still without ANN control) and which was the first and the only FES system approved by the FDA. The proposed neural network discriminates above-lesion upper-trunk electromyographic (EMG) time series to activate standing and walking functions under FES and controls FES stimuli levels using response-EMG signals. For this particular application, the authors introduce several modifications of the ART-1 for pattern recognition and classification. First, a modified on-line learning rule is proposed. The new rule assures bidirectorial modification of the stored patterns and prevents noise interference. Second, a new reset rule is proposed which prevents \"exact matching\" when the input is a subset of the chosen pattern. The authors show the applicability of a single ART-1-based structure to solving two problems, namely, 1) signal pattern recognition and classification, and 2) control. This also facilitates ambulation of paraplegics under FES, with adequate patient interaction in initial system training, retraining the network when needed, and in allowing patient's manual override in the ease of error, where any manual override serves as a retraining input to the neural network. Thus, the practical control problems (arising in actual independent patient ambulation via FES) were all satisfied by a relatively simple ANN design.","doi":"10.1109/10.391169","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/8860/00391169.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"707","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.391169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network control of FES in paraplegics for patient responsive ambulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network control of FES in paraplegics for patient responsive ambulation","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5007030","pubMedId":"7622153","publicationDate":"July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network control of FES in paraplegics for patient responsive ambulation","sourcePdf":"00391169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045259S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"49","articleId":"391169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":391206,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It has been found that the FN injection is an efficient method to recover pMOSFET's from the HC induced degradation. This is achieved by removing some of the trapped electrons from the oxide and forming positive charges along the channel. The relative importance of these two factors is determined. The contribution of the interface states created by FN injection is negligible, since they are acceptor-like and not charged during pMOSFET's operation. The positive charges increase the lifetime of a recovered pMOSFET by requiring more electron trapping to compensate their effects on the threshold voltage. They also enhance the magnitude of punchthrough voltage. The effects of FN injection on the HC trapping kinetics are discussed. Under our experimental conditions, the new trapping sites created by FN injection are negligible, compared with the as-grown traps. When a recovered pMOSFET is stressed again, its degradation rate is not higher than that of a fresh pMOSFET. This allows FN injection to be used repeatedly and we can therefore control the pMOSFET's degradation within a given range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.391209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/8862/00391209.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.391209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8862","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of high field injection on the hot carrier induced degradation of submicrometer pMOSFET's","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of high field injection on the hot carrier induced degradation of submicrometer pMOSFET's","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5000805","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of high field injection on the hot carrier induced degradation of submicrometer pMOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00391209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05293S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","articleId":"391209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391213,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The application of these two sensitive techniques reveals new information on the types of trap charges and the modes of degradation. At low V/sub g/ stress near threshold voltage, the fixed charge is attributed to holes. For high V/sub g/ stress, the fixed charge is predominantly electrons. Data for mid V/sub g/ stress suggest little net fixed charge trapping. Interface traps are observed for all stress conditions and are demonstrated from differential gate capacitance spectra to exhibit both donor and acceptor trap behavior. Mid V/sub g/ stress is shown to result in the highest density of interface traps. These traps can be annealed to a large extent for temperatures up to 300/spl deg/C. A post-stress generation of interface traps is observed at low V/sub g/ stress, in agreement with recent observation. Further, a linear relation is found to exist between the change in overlap gate capacitance and the increase in peak charge pumping current, and suggests spatial uniformity in the degradation of the interface.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.391215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.391215","endPage":"1328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/8862/00391215.pdf","startPage":"1321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of hot carrier degradation in NMOSEET's by gate capacitance and charge pumping current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391215/","displayDocTitle":"A study of hot carrier degradation in NMOSEET's by gate capacitance and charge pumping current","volume":"42","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5000811","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of hot carrier degradation in NMOSEET's by gate capacitance and charge pumping current","sourcePdf":"00391215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035618S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"34","articleId":"391215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":391237,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The inertial profile specifies the normalized moment of inertia of quantization cells as a function of location. The extension is formulated in terms of a sequence of quantizers whose point density and inertial profile approach known functions as the number of points increase. Precise conditions are given for the convergence of distortion (suitably normalized) to Bennett's integral. Previous extensions did not include the inertial profile and, consequently, provided only bounds or applied only to quantizers with congruent cells, such as lattice and optimal quantizers. The new version of Bennett's integral provides a framework for the analysis of suboptimal structured vector quantizers. It is shown how the loss in performance of such quantizers, relative to optimal unstructured ones, can be decomposed into point density and cell shape losses. As examples, these losses are computed for product quantizers and used to gain further understanding of the performance of scalar quantizers applied to stationary, memoryless sources and of transform codes applied to Gaussian sources with memory. It is shown that the short-coming of such quantizers is that they must compromise between point density and cell shapes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5000826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Bennett's integral for vector quantizers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bennett's integral for vector quantizers","sourcePdf":"00391237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049371S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"85","articleId":"391237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391239,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Even for sources that do not meet the necessary conditions for the growth algorithm to be optimal, such as for speech with unknown statistics, it is seen by simulation that the algorithm outperforms other known growth algorithms, For sources that do not satisfy the required conditions, the algorithm presented here can also be used to grow the initial tree for the pruning process.

By generalizing Smith's results for the scalar average and peak-power-constrained Gaussian channel, it is shown that the capacity achieving distribution is discrete in amplitude (envelope), having a finite number of mass-points, with a uniformly distributed independent phase and it is geometrically described by concentric circles. It is shown that with peak power being solely the effective constraint, a constant envelope with uniformly distributed phase input is capacity achieving for /spl rho//sub p//spl les/7.8 (dB 4.8 (dB) per dimension). The capacity under a peak-power constraint is evaluated for a wide range of /spl rho//sub p/, by incorporating the theoretical observations into a nonlinear dynamic programming procedure. Closed-form expressions for the asymptotic (low and large /spl rho//sub a/ and /spl rho//sub p/) capacity and the corresponding capacity achieving distribution and for lower and upper bounds on the capacity C(/spl rho//sub a/, /spl rho//sub p/) are developed. The capacity C(/spl rho//sub a/, /spl rho//sub p/) provides an improved ultimate upper bound on the reliable information rates transmitted over the QAGC with any communication systems subjected to both average and peak-power limitations, when compared to the classical Shannon formula for the capacity of the QAGC which does not account for the peak-power constraint. This is in particular important for systems that operate with restrictive (close to 1) average-to-peak power ratio /spl rho//sub a///spl rho//sub p/ and at moderate power values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.391243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.391243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8863/00391243.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity of average and peak-power-limited quadrature Gaussian channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of average and peak-power-limited quadrature Gaussian channels","volume":"41","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5000839","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391243/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of average and peak-power-limited quadrature Gaussian channels","sourcePdf":"00391243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062543S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"153","articleId":"391243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":391248,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

The first result is to find explicit finite sample upper bounds for the classical independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random sampling problem in a separable metric space setting. The convergence rate is a function of the covering numbers of the support of the distribution. For example, for bounded subsets of R/sup r/, the convergence rate is O(1/n/sup 2/r/). The main result is to extend the problem to allow samples drawn from a completely arbitrary random process in a separable metric space and to examine the performance in terms of the individual sample sequences. The authors show that for every sequence of samples the asymptotic time-average of nearest neighbor risks equals twice the time-average of the conditional Bayes risks of the sequence. Finite sample upper bounds under arbitrary sampling are again obtained in terms of the covering numbers of the underlying space. In particular, for bounded subsets of R/sup r/ the convergence rate of the time-averaged risk is O(1/n/sup 2/r/). The authors then establish a consistency result for k/sub n/-nearest neighbor estimation under arbitrary sampling and prove a convergence rate matching established rates for i.i.d. sampling. Finally, they show how their arbitrary sampling results lead to some classical i.i.d. sampling results and in fact extend them to stationary sampling. The framework and results are quite general while the proof techniques are surprisingly elementary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5000836","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rates of convergence of nearest neighbor estimation under arbitrary sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rates of convergence of nearest neighbor estimation under arbitrary sampling","sourcePdf":"00391248.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02773S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"77","articleId":"391248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":391250,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

A group detection scheme consists of a bank of P group detectors, one each for detecting the information symbols of users in each group of a P group partition of the K simultaneously transmitting users. In a parallel group detection scheme, these group detectors operate independently, whereas in a sequential scheme, each group detector. Uses the decisions of the previous group detectors to successively cancel the interference from those users. Group detectors based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) are obtained for the synchronous Gaussian CDMA channel. The complexity of these detectors is exponential in the group size, whereas that of the optimum detector is exponential in K. Since the partition of users is a design parameter, group sizes can be chosen to satisfy a wide range of complexity constraints. A key performance result is that the GLRT group detectors are optimally group near-far resistant. Furthermore, upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic efficiency of the sequential group detectors are derived. These bounds reveal that the sequential group detectors can, under certain conditions, perform as well as GLRT group detectors of much larger group sizes. Group detection provides a unifying approach to multiuser detection. When the users are partitioned into K single-user groups, the GLRT, a modified form of GLRT, and the sequential group detectors reduce to previously proposed suboptimal detectors; namely, the decorrelator, the two-stage detector, and the decorrelating decision-feedback detector, respectively. For the other nontrivial partitions, the group detectors are new and have a performance that is commensurate with their complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5000841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Group detection for synchronous Gaussian code-division multiple-access channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group detection for synchronous Gaussian code-division multiple-access channels","sourcePdf":"00391251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033424S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"171","articleId":"391251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391252,"authors":[{"name":"Feng-Wen Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Feng-Wen Sun","id":"37279269300"},{"name":"H.C.A. van Tilborg","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computing Science, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"H.C.A.","lastName":"van Tilborg","id":"37326679700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"391252","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Decoding","Sun","Linear code","Mathematics","Binary codes","Modular construction","Vectors","Materials science and technology","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","dual codes","decoding","Golay codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Leech lattice","octacode","decoding algorithms","Golay code","holy construction","glue code","permuted Turyn construction","multilevel representation","lattice partition chain","bounded-distance decoders","linear code","bounded-distance decoder","effective error coefficient","coset decoding","bounded distance decoding","subcode","self dual code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391252","abstract":"New multilevel constructions of the Golay code and the Leech lattice are presented.

Additionally, such systems require error-correction coding to ensure that the decoded output matches the recorder input, even if noise is present. Typically, these two coding steps have been performed independently, although various methods of combining them into one step have recently appeared. Another recent development is two-dimensional modulation codes, which meet runlength constraints using several parallel recording tracks, significantly increasing channel capacity. The article combines these two ideas. Previous techniques (both block and trellis structures) for combining error correction and modulation coding are surveyed, with discussion of their applicability in the two-dimensional case. One approach, based on trellis-coded modulation, is explored in detail, and a class of codes is developed which exploits the increased capacity to achieve good error-correcting ability at the same rate as common non-error-correcting one-dimensional codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","Magnetic heads","Saturation magnetization","Channel capacity","Magnetic recording","Digital recording","Synchronization","Decoding","Impedance matching","Magnetic noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis coded modulation","error correction codes","digital magnetic recording","block codes","runlength codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error-correcting 2D modulation codes","modulation coding","data stream","digital magnetic recording/playback systems","error-correction coding","recorder input","decoded output","noise","two-dimensional modulation codes","runlength constraints","parallel recording tracks","channel capacity","trellis structures","block structures","trellis-coded modulation","block codes","trellis coding","runlength coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.391254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8863/00391254.pdf","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.391254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-correcting two-dimensional modulation codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error-correcting two-dimensional modulation codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391254/","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5000844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-correcting two-dimensional modulation codes","sourcePdf":"00391254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048917S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","articleId":"391254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":391256,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Blum, R.I. Blum, and M. Shub introduced the x/sup 2/ mod N generator of pseudorandom bit strings and showed, given certain plausible but unproved hypotheses, that it has the desirable cryptographic property of unpredictability. They also studied the period length of the sequences produced by this generator and proposed a way to guarantee that these sequences will have maximum possible period. In this correspondence we prove that it is very likely that for many values of N the sequences produced by the x/sup 2/ mod N generator are usually not balanced (that is, having equal frequency of 0's and 1's). We further prove that the proposed method for guaranteeing long periods is also very likely to guarantee relatively large imbalances between the frequencies of 0's and 1's. However, we also prove that the average imbalance for these sequences is no worse than what would be expected in a truly random bit string of the same length. Thus our results provide further support for the use of the x/sup 2/ mod N generator in cryptographic applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.391261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/8863/00391261.pdf","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.391261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Properties of the x/sup 2/ mod N pseudorandom number generator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391261/","displayDocTitle":"Properties of the x/sup 2/ mod N pseudorandom number generator","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5000851","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Properties of the x/sup 2/ mod N pseudorandom number generator","sourcePdf":"00391261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050511S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","articleId":"391261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":391268,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The author proves that this index rule is optimal independent of the number of measurements to be taken. The author illustrates with numerical examples that, when the symmetry conditions are relaxed, the index policies are suboptimal, but achieve performance which is close to optimal.

To minimize computational load and architecture requirements, we adopt a three-step hierarchical search algorithm, that provides a quality comparable with more expensive full-search techniques. The proposed solution focuses on architectural efficiency by employing a minimum set of functional units (three simple processing units, one minimum unit, and four programmable delay lines), still supporting real-time performance for videoconferencing standards.

Exploitation of the rotation properties results in a reduction of the total ROM requirements of the unified architecture, to less than 10% of those of the typical distributed arithmetic DCT/IDCT implementations, thus yielding considerable area savings. Moreover, the proposed architecture can achieve the processing power of 100 Mpixels/sec, if implemented in 0.8 /spl mu/ CMOS technology, which is sufficient for the real-time processing of HDTV signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.391354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/8866/00391354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.391354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8866","startPage":"263","endPage":"272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low ROM distributed arithmetic implementation of the forward/inverse DCT/DST using rotations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low ROM distributed arithmetic implementation of the forward/inverse DCT/DST using rotations","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4994774","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low ROM distributed arithmetic implementation of the forward/inverse DCT/DST using rotations","sourcePdf":"00391354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059437S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"15","articleId":"391354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":391379,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Several decades of intensive research in software engineering and artificial intelligence left few alternatives but software reuse as the (only) realistic approach to bring about the gains of productivity and quality that the software industry needs. In this paper, we discuss the implications of reuse on the production, with an emphasis on the technical challenges. Software reuse involves building software that is reusable by design and building with reusable software. Software reuse includes reusing both the products of previous software projects and the processes deployed to produce them, leading to a wide spectrum of reuse approaches, from the building blocks (reusing products) approach, on one hand, to the generative or reusable processor (reusing processes), on the other. We discuss the implication of such approaches on the organization, control, and method of software development and discuss proposed models for their economic analysis. Software reuse benefits from methodologies and tools to: (1) build more readily reusable software and (2) locate, evaluate, and tailor reusable software, the last being critical for the building blocks approach. Both sets of issues are discussed in this paper, with a focus on application generators and OO development for the first and a thorough discussion of retrieval techniques for software components, component composition (or bottom-up design), and transformational systems for the second. We conclude by highlighting areas that, in our opinion, are worthy of further investigation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.391379","startPage":"528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/8867/00391379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.391379","endPage":"562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reusing software: issues and research directions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Reusing software: issues and research directions","volume":"21","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5000954","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reusing software: issues and research directions","sourcePdf":"00391379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121417S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"295","articleId":"391379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":391380,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

One such process is inspection, in which several reviewers independently analyze all or part of the specification and search for faults. These faults are then collected at a meeting of the reviewers and author(s). Usually, reviewers use Ad Hoc or Checklist methods to uncover faults. These methods force all reviewers to rely on nonsystematic techniques to search for a wide variety of faults. We hypothesize that a Scenario-based method, in which each reviewer uses different, systematic techniques to search for different, specific classes of faults, will have a significantly higher success rate. We evaluated this hypothesis using a 3/spl times/2/sup 4/ partial factorial, randomized experimental design. Forty eight graduate students in computer science participated in the experiment. They were assembled into sixteen, three-person teams. Each team inspected two SRS using some combination of Ad Hoc, Checklist or Scenario methods. For each inspection we performed four measurements: (1) individual fault detection rate, (2) team fault detection rate, (3) percentage of faults first identified at the collection meeting (meeting gain rate), and (4) percentage of faults first identified by an individual, but never reported at the collection meeting (meeting loss rate). The experimental results are that (1) the Scenario method had a higher fault detection rate than either Ad Hoc or Checklist methods, (2) Scenario reviewers were more effective at detecting the faults their scenarios are designed to uncover, and were no less effective at detecting other faults than both Ad Hoc or Checklist reviewers, (3) Checklist reviewers were no more effective than Ad Hoc reviewers, and (4) Collection meetings produced no net improvement in the fault detection rate-meeting gains were offset by meeting losses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.391380","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","startPage":"563","endPage":"575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/8867/00391380.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.391380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing detection methods for software requirements inspections: a replicated experiment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Fault detection","Fault diagnosis","Design for experiments","Computer science","Assembly","Performance evaluation","Gain measurement","Loss measurement","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","formal verification","software development management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection methods","software requirements inspections","replicated experiment","software requirements specifications","nonsystematic techniques","scenario-based method","individual fault detection rate","team fault detection rate","fault detection rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Comparing detection methods for software requirements inspections: a replicated experiment","volume":"21","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5000955","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391380/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing detection methods for software requirements inspections: a replicated experiment","sourcePdf":"00391380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039915S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"230","articleId":"391380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":391387,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The system has been tested on a wide variety of three-dimensional objects with different shapes and material and surface properties. A light-box setup is used to obtain silhouette images which are segmented to obtain the physical boundaries of the objects which are classified as either convex or concave. Convex curves are recognized using their four high-scale curvature extrema points. Curvature scale space (CSS) representations are computed for concave curves. The CSS representation is a multi-scale organization of the natural, invariant features of a curve (curvature zero-crossings or extrema) and useful for very reliable recognition of the correct model since it places no constraints on the shape of objects. A three-stage, coarse-to-fine matching algorithm prunes the search space in stage one by applying the CSS aspect ratio test. The maxima of contours in CSS representations of the surviving models are used for fast CSS matching in stage two. Finally, stage three verifies the best match and resolves any ambiguities by determining the distance between the image and model curves. Transformation parameter optimization is then used to find the best fit of the input object to the correct model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.391387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/8868/00391387.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.391387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silhouette-based isolated object recognition through curvature scale space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Silhouette-based isolated object recognition through curvature scale space","volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4988894","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silhouette-based isolated object recognition through curvature scale space","sourcePdf":"00391387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031342S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"133","articleId":"391387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":391388,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Abidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Abidi","id":"37269877100"},{"name":"T.

In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for pose estimation based on the volume measurement of tetrahedra composed of feature-point triplets extracted from an arbitrary quadrangular target and the lens center of the vision system. The inputs to this algorithm are the six distances joining all feature pairs and the image coordinates of the quadrangular target. The outputs of this algorithm are the effective focal length of the vision system, the interior orientation parameters of the target, the exterior orientation parameters of the camera with respect to an arbitrary coordinate system if the target coordinates are known in this frame, and the final pose of the camera. The authors have also developed a shape restoration technique which is applied prior to pose recovery in order to reduce the effects of inaccuracies caused by image projection. An evaluation of the method has shown that this pose estimation technique is accurate and robust. Because it is based on a unique and closed form solution, its speed makes it a potential candidate for solving a variety of landmark-based tracking problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new efficient and direct solution for pose estimation using quadrangular targets: algorithm and evaluation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.391388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/8868/00391388.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.391388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new efficient and direct solution for pose estimation using quadrangular targets: algorithm and evaluation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4988893","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new efficient and direct solution for pose estimation using quadrangular targets: algorithm and evaluation","sourcePdf":"00391388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043841S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"103","articleId":"391388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":391389,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Color indexing fails, however, when the incident illumination varies either spatially or spectrally. Although this limitation might be overcome by preprocessing with a color constancy algorithm, we instead propose histogramming color ratios. Since the ratios of color RGB triples from neighboring locations are relatively insensitive to changes in the incident illumination, this circumvents the need for color constancy preprocessing. Results of tests with the new color-constant-color-indexing algorithm on synthetic and real images show that it works very well even when the illumination varies spatially in its intensity and color.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.391390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/8868/00391390.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.391390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color constant color indexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Color constant color indexing","volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4988891","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color constant color indexing","sourcePdf":"00391390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074249S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"369","articleId":"391390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391393,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The RWT facilitates an anisotropic variable resolution. Unlike the log-polar, its variable resolution is predominantly in one dimension. Consequently, the RWT preserves linearity of lines and translations in the original image. In this paper, a concise matrix representation of the RWT is presented. Its properties in geometrical transformations and data reduction are described. A projective model for the transform and a potential hardware RWT camera design are also illustrated. As examples of initial applications, the RWT is used for finding road directions in navigation, and for recovering depth in motion stereo. Two types of motion stereo are presented, namely the longitudinal and lateral motion stereo. In all cases, the RWT images offer much reduced and adequate data owing to the variable resolution. Preliminary experimental results from test images of road-vehicle navigation and moving objects on a miniature assembly line are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/8868/00391393.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.391393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.391393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reciprocal-wedge transform for space-variant sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo vision","Navigation","Computer vision","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Linearity","Hardware","Cameras","Roads","Image resolution","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active vision","computer vision","stereo image processing","computational geometry","data reduction","navigation","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reciprocal-wedge transform","space-variant sensing","anisotropic variable resolution","concise matrix representation","geometrical transformations","data reduction","projective model","road direction finding","active vision","lateral motion stereo","longitudinal motion stereo","road-vehicle navigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Reciprocal-wedge transform for space-variant sensing","volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4988888","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reciprocal-wedge transform for space-variant sensing","sourcePdf":"00391393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043041S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"19","articleId":"391393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":391417,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, this distance measure is computationally expensive and it operates on high dimensional features (O(N)). We propose the use of low-dimensional, simple to compute distance measures between the color distributions, and show that these are lower bounds on the histogram distance measure. Results on color histogram matching in large image databases show that prefiltering with the simpler distance measures leads to significantly less time complexity because the quadratic histogram distance is now computed on a smaller set of images.

For a set of input specifications, FPAD deduces the device sizes that optimize the performance objectives while satisfying the constraint specifications. Fuzzy set theory is used to measure the degree of fulfilment of the objectives and constraints, and hence provides a measure of the design quality. Trade-offs are handled by manipulating the shape of the membership functions that reflect the fulfilment or violation of the performance specifications. FPAD allows the optimization of several objectives simultaneously since multiple objective optimization is used. The mathematical formulation of the design problem is fuzzified to support real-world terms like high, good, small, acceptable, etc. The optimization is based on analytic models to avoid a simulator in the inner optimization loop. Using this approach, a two-stage unbuffered CMOS op amp and a simple emitter follower were designed, with promising results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","volume":"14","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5006046","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"FPAD: a fuzzy nonlinear programming approach to analog circuit design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPAD: a fuzzy nonlinear programming approach to analog circuit design","sourcePdf":"00391726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04892S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"25","articleId":"391726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391727,"authors":[{"name":"J.

To overcome these obstacles, we present a general approach to statistical design which is computationally inexpensive and applicable to an extensive spectrum of analog-digital circuits, unlike previous inexpensive methods which limit the user to specific technologies, standard device models, and/or purely digital designs. This general applicability and cost efficiency is maintained through four factors. First, an efficient screening algorithm minimizes the dimensionality of the input parameter space by identifying the important input parameters. Second, a general, accurate, parsimonious nonparametric regression model is formulated so that a wide range of behavior between input parameters and output performances can be mapped, not just those with a linear regression relationship. Third, this approach tightly couples with a compiler-methodology based simulator which sustains the achieved flexibility through its model independence. Finally, a waveform analysis capability completely automates the procedure. An industry ECL bandgap regulator circuit illustrates the benefits of this method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STYLE: a statistical design approach based on nonparametric performance macromodeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.391727","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8875/00391727.pdf","startPage":"794","endPage":"802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.391727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"STYLE: a statistical design approach based on nonparametric performance macromodeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5006047","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STYLE: a statistical design approach based on nonparametric performance macromodeling","sourcePdf":"00391727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039236S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"4","articleId":"391727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":391740,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

The circuits are optimized through iterative addition and removal of redundancies. Adding redundant wires to a circuit may cause one or many existing irredundant wires and/or gates to become redundant. If the amount of added redundancies is less than the amount of created redundancies, the transformation of adding followed by removing redundancies will result in a smaller circuit. Based upon the Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) techniques, the proposed method can efficiently identify those wires for addition that would create more redundancies elsewhere in the network. Experiments on ISCAS-85 combinational benchmark circuits show that best results are obtained for most of them. For sequential circuits, experimental results on MCNC FSM benchmarks and ISCAS-89 sequential benchmark circuits show that a significant amount of area reduction can be achieved beyond combinational optimization and sequential redundancy removal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8875/00391740.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.391740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.391740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combinational and sequential logic optimization by redundancy addition and removal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Sequential circuits","Optimization methods","Automatic test pattern generation","Combinational circuits","Benchmark testing","Feedback loop","Circuit testing","Logic testing","Flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundancy","sequential circuits","combinational circuits","circuit optimisation","logic CAD","iterative methods","multivalued logic","circuit layout CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational logic optimization","sequential logic optimization","multilevel logic optimization","iterative addition","redundancy addition","automatic test pattern generation","ATPG techniques","area reduction","redundancy removal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Combinational and sequential logic optimization by redundancy addition and removal","volume":"14","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5006059","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combinational and sequential logic optimization by redundancy addition and removal","sourcePdf":"00391740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072556S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"88","articleId":"391740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":391743,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These requirements can be used to design an interface between land-based and mobile environments to handle one of the most challenging issues in multimedia communication: enforcing interstream and intrastream synchronizations.

First: a very poor radio link quality. Second: the users' mobility, which requires the management of their position, is resource consuming (especially radio bandwidth). This paper focuses on the second issue and proposes an intelligent method for users locating: the alternative strategy (AS). Our proposal is based on the observation that the mobility behavior of a majority of people can be foretold. If taken into consideration by the system, this characteristic can save signaling messages due to mobility management procedures, leading thus to savings in the system resources. Several versions of the AS are described: a basic version for long term events (i.e., received calls and registrations), and versions with increased memory for short and medium term events. The evaluation of the basic versions was performed using analytic and simulation approaches. It shows that storing the mobility related information brings great savings in system resources when the users have medium or high predictable mobility patterns. More generally speaking, this work points out the fact that the future systems will have to integrate users related information in order: firstly: to provide customized services and secondly: to save system resources. On the other hand, current trends in mobile communications show that adaptive and dynamic system capabilities require that more information to be collected and computed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","volume":"13","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4982175","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An alternative strategy for location tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative strategy for location tracking","sourcePdf":"00391746.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040261S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"156","articleId":"391746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":391749,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Motion across wireless cell boundaries causes increased delays and packet losses while the network learns how to route data to a host's new location. Reliable transport protocols like TCP interpret these delays and losses as signs of network congestion. They consequently throttle their transmissions, further degrading performance. We quantify this degradation through measurements of protocol behavior in a wireless networking testbed. We show how current TCP implementations introduce unacceptably long pauses in communication during cellular handoffs (800 ms and longer), and propose an end-to-end fast retransmission scheme that can reduce these pauses to levels more suitable for human interaction (200 ms). Our work makes clear the need for reliable transport protocols to differentiate between motion-related and congestion-related packet losses and suggests how to adapt these protocols to perform better in mobile computing environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.391749","startPage":"850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8876/00391749.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.391749","endPage":"857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the performance of reliable transport protocols in mobile computing environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Improving the performance of reliable transport protocols in mobile computing environments","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4982172","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the performance of reliable transport protocols in mobile computing environments","sourcePdf":"00391749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034329S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"294","articleId":"391749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":391751,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

It also shows how source presenting is a way to use excess bandwidth-delay product to reduce the browser response time, and how this is one example of a truly gigabit protocol.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"4982170","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Defining high-speed protocols: five challenges and an example that survives the challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defining high-speed protocols: five challenges and an example that survives the challenges","sourcePdf":"00391751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033508S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","articleId":"391751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":391753,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

A range of service types can be deployed, based on a differing sophistication, which must be traded against the network costs (bandwidth) and component costs (switch complexity and memory). The potential aggregate bandwidth required is huge (O(1Pb/s)), and thus it is essential to properly engineer the network to reduce the bandwidth required. This paper describes a variety of IVOD scenarios, and introduces a cost function that captures the combined bandwidth and storage requirements of the network. This cost function is used to compare different network engineering alternatives, particularly program caching and stream sharing. The effects of nonlinear pricing and differing weights of bandwidth and storage are also reflected by the cost function. This cost function can be used by network designers to determine optimal topology, sharing, and caching strategies for desired bandwidth versus memory costs in a particular network deployment. In addition, a simulation model is used to evaluate caching of programs or windows within programs. We show that there are some results that are widely applicable. In particular, the level in the network at which caching should take place is at approximately 80% depth in the distribution tree, above the head end switch in the network hierarchy. We also observe that the bandwidth savings in sharing streams (actually buffered windows of program content) is fairly small for user behavior based on Zipfs law. The overall intent of this work is to evaluate the effects of various server, cache, and sharing strategies on the bandwidth and storage requirements of the network and their proper placement within the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8876/00391753.pdf","doi":"10.1109/49.391753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.391753","startPage":"779","endPage":"787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Networking requirements for interactive video on demand","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391753/","displayDocTitle":"Networking requirements for interactive video on demand","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4982168","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Networking requirements for interactive video on demand","sourcePdf":"00391753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033115S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"113","articleId":"391753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391770,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

Surgeons rely on sensations from the finger tips to guide manipulation and to perceive a wide variety of anatomical structures and pathologies. Unfortunately, new surgical techniques separate the surgeon's hands from the surgical site. These techniques include minimally invasive procedures such as laparoscopy and thoracoscopy, and new techniques involving robotic manipulators. In these situations the surgeon's perception is limited to visual feedback from a video camera, or gross motion and force feedback through the handles of long instruments. The authors are working to develop new technology to rectify this sensory deficit by relaying tactile information from the surgical site to the surgeon. They have developed a variety of tactile sensors that can be mounted in a probe or surgical instrument. The tactile information provided by these sensors may then be conveyed through the tactile display devices the authors have developed to recreate the tactile stimulus directly on the surgeon's finger tip. By using these remote palpation devices, the surgeon may regain some of the perceptual and manipulative skills present in conventional open-incision surgery. Among the tactile feedback parameters the authors are investigating are force reflection, vibration, and small-scale shape.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/8877/00391770.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/51.391770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.391770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote palpation technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surges","Force feedback","Fingers","Tactile sensors","Anatomical structure","Pathology","Minimally invasive surgery","Laparoscopes","Robot sensing systems","Manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surgery","tactile sensors","biomedical equipment","manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote palpation technology","anatomical structures","pathologies","minimally invasive procedures","laparoscopy","thoracoscopy","robotic manipulators","surgeon's perception","video camera visual feedback","sensory deficit","tactile information relay","probe","surgical instrument","tactile information","tactile display devices","surgeon's finger tip","conventional open-incision surgery","force reflection","vibration","small-scale shape"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Remote palpation technology","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1995","accessionNumber":"4988267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote palpation technology","sourcePdf":"00391770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05349S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1995","isNumber":"8877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"215","articleId":"391770","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":391774,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

At the authors' institute, three golden rules have guided the computer assisted medical interventions (CAMI) project for about ten years: 1) conceive systems for which the clinical value is well defined; 2) develop generic tools that can be applied to many different clinical applications; and 3) provide efficient collaboration between the surgeon and the system through simple interfaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/51.391779","startPage":"254","endPage":"263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/8877/00391779.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.391779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer assisted medical interventions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Shape","Surgery","Image sensors","Optical imaging","Probes","Sensor systems","Anatomical structure","Ultrasonic imaging","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surgery","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer assisted medical interventions","stereotactic neurosurgery","surgical specialities","technical issues","clinical value","generic tools","simple interfaces","efficient collaboration","10 y"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Computer assisted medical interventions","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4988258","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer assisted medical interventions","sourcePdf":"00391779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078476S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1995","isNumber":"8877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"74","articleId":"391779","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":391883,"authors":[{"name":"Qihua Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Qihua Zhao","id":"37087189898"},{"name":"Jin Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jin Jiang","id":"37087190919"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"391883","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the design and evaluation of a robust controller for generator excitation systems to improve the steady-state and transient stabilities. The unique approach used is to first treat the nonlinear characteristics of the system as model uncertainties, and then to take into account such uncertainties at the controller design stage using a robust control methodology. The performance of the controller has been evaluated extensively by nonlinear simulation. It is concluded that the robust controller provides better damping to the oscillatory modes of the system than the conventional PSS in all the cases studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Control systems","Power system stability","Power system modeling","Robust stability","Power system transients","Uncertainty","Power system simulation","Damping","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","power system transients","robust control","control system synthesis","controllers","oscillations","damping","AC generators","machine control","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generator excitation systems","robust controller design","steady-state stability","transient stability","power system stabiliser","PSS","nonlinear characteristics","model uncertainties","nonlinear simulation","oscillatory modes damping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/60.391883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/8879/00391883.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.391883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust controller design for generator excitation systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=391883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust controller design for generator excitation systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391883/","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5007587","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust controller design for generator excitation systems","sourcePdf":"00391883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028484S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"47","articleId":"391883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":391888,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

First, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model is introduced for fuzzy logic control. The characteristic rules and their membership functions of fuzzy systems are represented as the processing nodes in the ANN model. With the excellent learning capability inherent in the ANN, the traditional heuristic fuzzy control rules and input/output fuzzy membership functions can be optimally tuned from training examples by the backpropagation learning algorithm. Considerable rule-matching times of the inference engine in the traditional fuzzy system can be saved. To illustrate the performance and usefulness of the SONFC, comparative studies with a bang-bang controller are performed on the 34-generator Taipower system with rather encouraging results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.391901","startPage":"339","endPage":"347","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/8879/00391901.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.391901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based self-organizing fuzzy controller for transient stability of multimachine power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Power system transients","Fuzzy systems","Power system modeling","Control systems","Power system stability","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","power system transients","power system control","fuzzy neural nets","neurocontrollers","self-adjusting systems","control system synthesis","bang-bang control","fuzzy control","backpropagation","control system analysis","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimachine power systems","self-organizing fuzzy control","transient stability","artificial neural network","fuzzy logic control","characteristic rules","membership functions","control design","learning capability","heuristic fuzzy control rules","training","backpropagation learning algorithm","rule-matching times","performance","bang-bang controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based self-organizing fuzzy controller for transient stability of multimachine power systems","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5007605","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based self-organizing fuzzy controller for transient stability of multimachine power systems","sourcePdf":"00391901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03917S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"17","articleId":"391901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":391903,"authors":[{"name":"O.P.

II. IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications","abstract":"An understanding of the history of AI applications through its primary conferences is important for several reasons. First, it provides insight into some of the pioneers to the field and their contributions. Second, it sheds light on the nature of the contributions of academic and nonacademic organizations to the field of AI applications. Third, the national origins of the organizations supporting AI applications reflect the international structure of AI applications. Accordingly, this review focuses on the authors of papers specializing in AI applications and their organizations and countries of origin, and on the program committee members, and their organizations and countries of origin. This review takes a quantitative approach to analyzing the history of AI applications. The IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications (CAIA) is one of the first and longest running applications conferences to specialize on AI application issues. This article provides an initial view of the history of the CAIA and of AI applications in general since 1984. It gathers information regarding both the research papers and committee members, the two primary sources of data in the proceedings. This article considers quantity issues, making inferences based on various statistics. However, it ignores what might be called quality issues, since each paper goes through the same referee process required for the conference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/391955/","volume":"10","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4970338","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the history of AI applications.

Obviously, the data from the two ends must be brought together via data communications, either from one substation to the other or to a computer at a third site to which both substations can send the data. This might be a control center, relay engineer's office, or maintenance depot, which are ideal locations for really accurate fault location displays to be presented. Some two-ended location algorithms require time synchronization of the data from the two ends, which is not widely available. This article presents new calculations that do not require any such synchronization of the records to achieve excellent accuracy. Following an overview of the technical problems in computing fault location from fault voltage and current signals, a sampling of the newest and most accurate techniques that are easily implemented in existing digital devices for calculating location from one-ended or two ended line fault data records is given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel3/67/8883/00392027.pdf","doi":"10.1109/67.392027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.392027","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault location using digital relay data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392027/","displayDocTitle":"Fault location using digital relay data","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4995604","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault location using digital relay data","sourcePdf":"00392027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029796S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"26","articleId":"392027","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392202,"authors":[{"name":"N.G.

Applications include spatio-temporal image understanding and prediction and 3D object recognition from a series of ambiguous 2D views. The architecture, called ART-EMAP, achieves a synthesis of adaptive resonance theory (ART) and spatial and temporal evidence integration for dynamic predictive mapping (EMAP). ART-EMAP extends the capabilities of fuzzy ARTMAP in four incremental stages. Stage 1 introduces distributed pattern representation at a view category field. Stage 2 adds a decision criterion to the mapping between view and object categories, delaying identification of ambiguous objects when faced with a low confidence prediction. Stage 3 augments the system with a field where evidence accumulates in medium-term memory. Stage 4 adds an unsupervised learning process to fine-tune performance after the limited initial period of supervised network training.

An adaptive algorithm is derived which enables stable adaptation of the neural controller for this purpose, while providing the capacity to maintain causality within the control scheme. The algorithm is shown to be simply a generalization of the linear filtered-x LMS algorithm. Experiments are undertaken which demonstrate the utility of the proposed arrangement, showing that it performs as well as a linear control system for a linear control problem and better for a nonlinear control problem. The experiments also lead to the conclusion that more work is required to improve the predictability and consistency of the performance before the neural network controller becomes a practical alternative to the current linear feedforward systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.392246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8889/00392246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.392246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8889","startPage":"819","endPage":"828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active control of vibration using a neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active control of vibration using a neural network","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5002609","pubMedId":"18263372","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active control of vibration using a neural network","sourcePdf":"00392246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03142S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"106","articleId":"392246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":392247,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

Constructive or destructive methods that add or subtract neurons, layers, connections, etc. might offer a solution to this problem. We prove that one method, recurrent cascade correlation, due to its topology, has fundamental limitations in representation and thus in its learning capabilities. It cannot represent with monotone (i.e., sigmoid) and hard-threshold activation functions certain finite state automata. We give a \"preliminary\" approach on how to get around these limitations by devising a simple constructive training method that adds neurons during training while still preserving the powerful fully-recurrent structure.

Many neural models thus proposed end up relying on global connections, leading to the question of whether lateral connections alone can produce remote synchronization. With a formulation different from frequently used phase models, we find that locally coupled neural oscillators can yield global synchrony. The model employs a previously suggested mechanism that the efficacy of the connections is allowed to change on a fast time scale. Based on the known connectivity of the visual cortex, the model outputs closely resemble the experimental findings. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential of locally connected oscillator networks in perceptual grouping and pattern segmentation, which seems missing in globally connected ones.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392256/","volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5002619","pubMedId":"18263382","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"Emergent synchrony in locally coupled neural oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emergent synchrony in locally coupled neural oscillators","sourcePdf":"00392256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067619S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"126","articleId":"392256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":392258,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Technology, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Wang","id":"37087146257"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"392258","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Neural networks","Very large scale integration","Signal processing algorithms","Hopfield neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Operational amplifiers","Circuits","Neural network hardware","Data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","analogue processing circuits","operational amplifiers","sorting","network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog sorting network","order representations","assignment problem","neural network architecture","analog neural network","bitonic sorting","monotonic sorting"]}],"abstract":"An analog sorting neural network is presented.

The network takes advantage of several mechanisms in the human visual system, including retinal adaptation, spectral opponency, and spectrally-specific long-range inhibition. This last stage is a novel mechanism based on cells which have been described in cortical area V4. All stages include nonlinear response functions. The model emulates human performance in several psychophysical paradigms designed to test color constancy and color induction. We measured the amount of constancy achieved with both natural and artificial simulated illuminants, using homogeneous grey backgrounds and more complex backgrounds, such as Mondrians. On average, the model performs as well or better than the average human color constancy performance under similar conditions. The network simulation also displays color induction and assimilation behavior consistent with human perceptual data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.392259","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8889/00392259.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.392259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multistage neural network for color constancy and color induction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"A multistage neural network for color constancy and color induction","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5002622","pubMedId":"18263385","publicationDate":"July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multistage neural network for color constancy and color induction","sourcePdf":"00392259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102179S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"25","articleId":"392259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":392260,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jhih Wu","affiliation":["HNC Inc.

The SLNN is designed to cooperate with a phase shift keying (PSK) demodulator, an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit, and a 3-bit quantizer which is an analog to digital convertor. It is trained to learn the best uniform quantization step-size /spl Delta//sub BEST/ as a function of the mean and the standard deviation of various sets of Gaussian distributed random variables. The channel cutoff rate (R/sub 0/) of the channel is employed to determine the best quantization threshold step-size (/spl Delta//sub BEST/) that results in the minimization of the Viterbi decoder output bit error rate (BER). For a digital communication system with a SLNN coprocessor, consistent and substantial BER performance improvements are observed. The performance improvement ranges from a minimum of 9% to a maximum of 25% for a pure AWGN channel and from a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 70% for a fading channel. This neural network coprocessor approach can be generalized and applied to any digital signal processing system to decrease the performance losses associated with quantization and/or signal instability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.392260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8889/00392260.pdf","startPage":"986","endPage":"992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.392260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A supervised learning neural network coprocessor for soft-decision maximum-likelihood decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392260/","displayDocTitle":"A supervised learning neural network coprocessor for soft-decision maximum-likelihood decoding","volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5002623","pubMedId":"18263386","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A supervised learning neural network coprocessor for soft-decision maximum-likelihood decoding","sourcePdf":"00392260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035842S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"5","articleId":"392260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":392261,"authors":[{"name":"Chua-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chua-Chin Wang","id":"37086998613"},{"name":"Jyh-Ping Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyh-Ping Lee","id":"37087366745"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"392261","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392261","abstract":"A method for modeling the learning of belief combination in evidential reasoning using a neural network is presented.

Most important of all, a majority rule of decision making in presentation of multiple evidence is also found by the study of signal-noise-ratio of multiple eBAM network. A guaranteed stable state condition, i.e., the condition for the fastest recall of a pattern pair, is also studied.

M=2/sup q/ radix r parallel computational elements are allocated per column of the FFT flowgraph, and the constant geometry FFT is used for uniform stages. The first method solves the interstage data shuffle problem by decomposing the perfect shuffle matrix into the product of four matrices, with a memory grouping resulting in a reduction of switching from M/sup 2/ to 2M. The second method decomposes to the perfect shuffle into the product of two matrices, and the memory is partitioned such that multiport elements may be used. All required switching is accomplished via addressing of the multiport elements requiring no external switching elements. Finally implementations are presented which allow for a varied amount of parallization by using uniform modules and merely modifying interconnect wiring.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.392316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8891/00392316.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.392316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8891","startPage":"414","endPage":"423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial column FFT pipelines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial column FFT pipelines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5008507","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial column FFT pipelines","sourcePdf":"00392316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030117S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"27","articleId":"392316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":392318,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The approach is based on stochastic optimization and extends previous work on finite impulse response (FIR) filters in two ways: by inclusion of spatial constraints and by application to the case of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The formulation proposed is based on a multiple-term objective function that, in addition to magnitude constraints, also includes step response, group delay and stability constraints. Our attention to these characteristics stems from the application of such filters to video processing that we are actively pursuing. Since filter coefficients are of finite precision and since the objective function is multivariable, nondifferentiable and likely to have multiple minima, we use simulated annealing for optimization. We show numerous examples of the design of practical filters such as channel and luminance/chrominance separation filters used in the NTSC system. We demonstrate the impact of coefficient precision as well as of group delay and step response constraints on filter parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.392318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.392318","startPage":"424","endPage":"431","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8891/00392318.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of multidimensional finite-wordlength FIR and IIR filters by simulated annealing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Design of multidimensional finite-wordlength FIR and IIR filters by simulated annealing","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5008508","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392318/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multidimensional finite-wordlength FIR and IIR filters by simulated annealing","sourcePdf":"00392318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060479S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"40","articleId":"392318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":392332,"authors":[{"name":"Yongyi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Yongyi Yang","id":"37087143400"},{"name":"N.P.

For this approach, the compressed images are decoded using only the transmitted transform data. We formulate image decoding as an image recovery problem. According to this approach, the decoded image is reconstructed using not only the transmitted data but, in addition, the prior knowledge that images before compression do not display between-block discontinuities. A spatially adaptive image recovery algorithm is proposed based on the theory of projections onto convex sets. Apart from the data constraint set, this algorithm uses another new constraint set that enforces between-block smoothness. The novelty of this set is that it captures both the local statistical properties of the image and the human perceptual characteristics. A simplified spatially adaptive recovery algorithm is also proposed, and the analysis of its computational complexity is presented. Numerical experiments are shown that demonstrate that the proposed algorithms work better than both the JPEG deblocking recommendation and our previous projection-based image decoding approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8892/00392332.pdf","startPage":"896","endPage":"908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.392332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.392332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection-based spatially adaptive reconstruction of block-transform compressed images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image coding","Decoding","Discrete transforms","Displays","Transform coding","Filters","Convergence","Humans","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image coding","data compression","adaptive signal processing","decoding","transform coding","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","block-transform compressed images","projection-based spatially adaptive reconstruction","transmitted transform data","image decoding","image recovery","image reconstruction","spatially adaptive image recovery algorithm","projections onto convex sets","data constraint set","local statistical properties","human perceptual characteristics","computational complexity","numerical experiments","JPEG deblocking recommendation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"Projection-based spatially adaptive reconstruction of block-transform compressed images","volume":"4","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5002968","pubMedId":"18290041","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection-based spatially adaptive reconstruction of block-transform compressed images","sourcePdf":"00392332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044417S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"254","articleId":"392332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":392333,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Fractal block coders have exploited the self-similarity among blocks in images. We devise an image coder in which the causal similarity among blocks of different subbands in a multiresolution decomposition of the image is exploited. In a pyramid subband decomposition, the image is decomposed into a set of subbands that are localized in scale, orientation, and space. The proposed coding scheme consists of predicting blocks in one subimage from blocks in lower resolution subbands with the same orientation. Although our prediction maps are of the same kind of those used in fractal block coders, which are based on an iterative mapping scheme, our coding technique does not impose any contractivity constraint on the block maps. This makes the decoding procedure very simple and allows a direct evaluation of the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and the reconstructed image at coding time. More importantly, we show that the subband pyramid acts as an automatic block classifier, thus making the block search simpler and the block matching more effective. These advantages are confirmed by the experimental results, which show that the performance of our scheme is superior for both visual quality and MSE to that obtainable with standard fractal block coders and also to that of other popular image coders such as JPEG.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.392333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8892/00392333.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.392333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8892","startPage":"909","endPage":"920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image coding by block prediction of multiresolution subimages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image coding by block prediction of multiresolution subimages","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5002969","pubMedId":"18290042","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image coding by block prediction of multiresolution subimages","sourcePdf":"00392333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073554S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"67","articleId":"392333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392335,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Linear estimates are relatively easy to compute but generally introduce systematic errors; for example, they are incapable of recovering discontinuities and other important image attributes. In contrast, nonlinear estimates are more accurate but are often far less accessible. This is particularly true when the objective function is nonconvex, and the distribution of each data component depends on many image components through a linear operator with broad support. Our approach is based on an auxiliary array and an extended objective function in which the original variables appear quadratically and the auxiliary variables are decoupled. Minimizing over the auxiliary array alone yields the original function so that the original image estimate can be obtained by joint minimization. This can be done efficiently by Monte Carlo methods, for example by FFT-based annealing using a Markov chain that alternates between (global) transitions from one array to the other. Experiments are reported in optical astronomy, with space telescope data, and computed tomography.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.392335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8892/00392335.pdf","startPage":"932","endPage":"946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.392335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear image recovery with half-quadratic regularization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear image recovery with half-quadratic regularization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392335/","publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5002971","pubMedId":"18290044","volume":"4","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear image recovery with half-quadratic regularization","sourcePdf":"00392335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049291S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"514","articleId":"392335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":392336,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Many texture segmentation schemes are based on a filter-bank model, where the filters, called Gabor filters, are derived from Gabor elementary functions. The goal is to transform texture differences into detectable filter-output discontinuities at texture boundaries. By locating these discontinuities, one can segment the image into differently textured regions. Distinct discontinuities occur, however, only if the Gabor filter parameters are suitably chosen. Some previous analysis has shown how to design filters for discriminating simple textures. Designing filters for more general natural textures, though, has largely been done ad hoc. We have devised a more rigorously based method for designing Gabor filters. It assumes that an image contains two different textures and that prototype samples of the textures are given a priori. We argue that Gabor filter outputs can be modeled as Rician random variables (often approximated well as Gaussian rv's) and develop a decision-theoretic algorithm for selecting optimal filter parameters. To improve segmentations for difficult texture pairs, we also propose a multiple-filter segmentation scheme, motivated by the Rician model. Experimental results indicate that our method is superior to previous methods in providing useful Gabor filters for a wide range of texture pairs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.392336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8892/00392336.pdf","startPage":"947","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.392336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Gabor filters for texture segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392336/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Gabor filters for texture segmentation","volume":"4","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5002972","pubMedId":"18290045","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Gabor filters for texture segmentation","sourcePdf":"00392336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048385S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"298","articleId":"392336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392344,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

Specifically, in the case of block-based transform coded images, loss of one or more packets due to network congestion or transmission errors can result in errant or entirely lost blocks in the decoded image. This article proposes a computationally efficient technique for reconstruction of lost transform coefficients at the decoder that takes advantage of the correlation between transformed blocks of the image. Lost coefficients are linearly interpolated from the same coefficients in adjacent blocks subject to a squared edge error criterion, and the resulting reconstructed coefficients minimize blocking artifacts in the image while providing visually pleasing reconstructions. The required computational expense at the decoder per reconstructed block is less than 1.2 times a non-recursive DCT, and as such this technique is useful for low power, low complexity applications that require good visual performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.392344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.392344","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1027","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8892/00392344.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transform coded image reconstruction exploiting interblock correlation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"Transform coded image reconstruction exploiting interblock correlation","publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"4","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5002979","pubMedId":"18290052","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392344/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transform coded image reconstruction exploiting interblock correlation","sourcePdf":"00392344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06003S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"101","articleId":"392344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":392371,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

Rehabilitators might also improve therapy by responding to the patient more quickly and precisely than a human therapist and by quantitatively measuring patient progress. The authors envision developing a family of inexpensive machines, each designed to retrain coordination in a specific activity of daily living, which could be used by physical and occupational therapists. To this end, the authors have built a rehabilitator for assisting hemiplegic stroke patients in bimanual lifting. In this task, subjects lift an object off a table with two hands, support it, then replace it on the table. If the disabled hand is unable to contribute to the task, the rehabilitator substitutes for it. The rehabilitator can substitute for the disabled hand well enough to lift a cafeteria tray with a cup of coffee on it without spilling it.

We find that user-initiated TCP session arrivals, such as remote-login and file-transfer, are well-modeled as Poisson processes with fixed hourly rates, but that other connection arrivals deviate considerably from Poisson; that modeling TELNET packet interarrivals as exponential grievously underestimates the burstiness of TELNET traffic, but using the empirical Tcplib interarrivals preserves burstiness over many time scales; and that FTP data connection arrivals within FTP sessions come bunched into \"connection bursts\", the largest of which are so large that they completely dominate FTP data traffic.

Such a physical medium permits the limited number of wavelengths to be re-used among the various fiber links, thereby offering very high aggregate capacity. Although the optical connectivity among the access station can be altered by changing the states of the various optical switches, the resulting optical connectivity pattern is constrained by the limitation imposed at the physical level. The authors also study two routing schemes, used to route requests for virtual connections. The heuristic is tested on a realistic traffic model, and the call blocking performance of new requests for virtual connections is studied through extensive simulations and compared against the blocking performance of an ideal infinite capacity centralized switch (lowest possible call blocking caused exclusively by congestion on the finite capacity user input/output links, never by the switch fabric itself). Surprisingly, the authors find that, for a wide range of parameters, the blocking performance of the lightwave network is almost the same as that of the ideal centralized switch. From these results, they conclude that the heuristic algorithm is effective and the routing scheme is efficient.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/90.392387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.392387","endPage":"288","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/8894/00392387.pdf","startPage":"281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic wavelength assignment algorithm for multihop WDM networks with wavelength routing and wavelength re-use","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392387/","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic wavelength assignment algorithm for multihop WDM networks with wavelength routing and wavelength re-use","volume":"3","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5003481","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic wavelength assignment algorithm for multihop WDM networks with wavelength routing and wavelength re-use","sourcePdf":"00392387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07269S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"139","articleId":"392387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392392,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The following issues are addressed: video system delay caused by internal buffering, traffic descriptors (TD) for video, and call admission. We find that while different video sequences require different TD parameters, the following trends hold for all sequences examined. First, increasing the delay in the video system decreases the necessary peak rate and significantly increases the number of calls that can be carried by the network. Second, as an operational traffic descriptor for video, the leaky-bucket algorithm appears to be superior to the sliding-window algorithm. And finally, with a delay in the video system, the statistical multiplexing gain from VBR over CBR video is upper bounded by roughly a factor of four, and to obtain a gain of about 2.0 can require the operational traffic descriptor to have a window or bucket size on the order of a thousand cells. We briefly discuss how increasing the complexity of the video system may enable the size of the bucket or window to be reduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5003486","displayDocTitle":"Traffic descriptors for VBR video teleconferencing over ATM networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic descriptors for VBR video teleconferencing over ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00392392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059593S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"94","articleId":"392392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":392799,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Recently, node clustering or compaction has been shown to enhance the performance of iterative partitioning algorithms by several authors. However, clustering has been mainly used as a preprocessing step before partitioning in existing methods. The paper describes a technique to extract clusters using information collected during a pass of an iterative exchange algorithm. Alternative approaches for the implementation of this new clustering technique are discussed, and one such approach is chosen to be incorporated in a modified Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm (C.M. Fiduccia, R.M. Mattheyses, 1982) based on a tradeoff between run time and performance. The resulting algorithm, BISECT, performs well in comparison with variants of the Kernighan-Lin algorithm including the Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm, local approaches, and simulated annealing on a wide variety of real and randomly generated benchmarks. BISECT is also used to find small vertex separators, and its results are compared with previous methods on several benchmarks. The empirical results show that BISECT is stable and is not very sensitive to the initial partition. Under suitably mild assumptions, BISECT can be shown to run in linear time. The empirical results confirm the speed of BISECT which can partition very large graphs (12,598 nodes and 91,961 edges) in less than six minutes of CPU time on a Sun Sparc 1+ workstation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast and robust network bisection algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.392848","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8936/00392848.pdf","startPage":"903","endPage":"913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.392848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"A fast and robust network bisection algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5013073","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast and robust network bisection algorithm","sourcePdf":"00392848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069298S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"29","articleId":"392848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392853,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37069212100"},{"name":"V.K.

A digital signal-processing technique for making an ultrasonic transducer array capable of automatically compensating for variations in the speed of sound due to temperature or any other atmospheric conditions is proposed and discussed in this paper. The technique is based on an iterative linearized least-squares estimator, namely an extended Kalman filtering algorithm, for processing the time-of-flight measurements from a reference target whose location is only approximately known. In contrast to other well-known techniques, neither additional external sensors for monitoring the environment nor accurately positioned reference targets are required. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed algorithm is performed through a Monte Carlo simulation study. The theoretical analysis provides a clear-cut picture for understanding the merits of the technique under a variety of physical operating conditions. The level of the measurement noise and the correct calibration of the transducers are proven to be the crucial factors for obtaining estimates of the speed of sound at a prescribed level of accuracy, given a fixed temporal interval for collecting the measurements. The main conclusions of the simulation study are confirmed by some real-life results obtained using an experimental tracking sonar device.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5013055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A digital signal-processing technique for compensating ultrasonic sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital signal-processing technique for compensating ultrasonic sensors","sourcePdf":"00392873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043816S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"8937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"47","articleId":"392873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392876,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Then, the spatial domain Green's functions are obtained by adding the contributions of the direct terms, surface waves, and complex images approximated by the Generalized Pencil of Functions Method (GPOF). In the derivations, the main emphasis is to put these closed-form representations in a suitable form for the solution of the mixed potential integral equation (MPIE) by the method of moments in a general three-dimensional geometry. The contributions of this paper are: 1) providing the complete set of closed-form Green's functions in spectral and spatial domains for general stratified media; 2) using the GPOF method, which is more robust and less noise sensitive, in the derivation of the closed-form spatial domain Green's functions; and 3) casting the closed-form Green's functions in a form to provide efficient applications of the method of moments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8938/00392913.pdf","startPage":"1545","endPage":"1552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.392913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.392913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form Green's functions for general sources and stratified media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Green's function methods","Magnetic domains","Moment methods","Magnetic multilayers","Magnetic analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Surface waves","Integral equations","Geometry","Nonhomogeneous media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Green's function methods","integral equations","method of moments","microstrip lines","waveguide theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form Green's functions","stratified media","vector potentials","scalar potentials","spatial domain","planar media","recursive algorithm","surface waves","complex images","generalized pencil of functions method","mixed potential integral equation","method of moments","three-dimensional geometry","microstrip geometries"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form Green's functions for general sources and stratified media","volume":"43","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5035125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form Green's functions for general sources and stratified media","sourcePdf":"00392913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037327S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"181","articleId":"392913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392916,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

In cases where noise figure or output power is at a premium, the performance of an amplifier can often be enhanced by using a design where k is less than unity thereby avoiding resistive loading. While a simultaneous conjugate match is impossible for such conditionally stable designs, single-sided matching can be achieved. Low-noise and power designs are examples where single-sided matching considerations naturally occur. With single-sided matching and 0<k<1, a design method is presented that results in device impedances on both the matched and unmatched sides that are always inside the Unit Smith Chart. This condition is referred to as jointly (input/output) stable. Gains resulting from jointly stable terminating impedances are shown to be bounded, the upper bound being given by 2 /spl middot/k/spl middot/ maximum stable gain.

A two-layer tissue model consists of an outer thin skin layer over a semi-infinite fat layer is analyzed for a X-band total power radiometer. A spherical tumor with same permittivity as, but slightly higher temperature than, the surrounding normal fat tissue is assumed to exist inside the fat tissue. Active probe characteristics are analyzed first using the FDTD method for a propagating, sinusoidally time-varying, TE/sub 10/ type of excitation source. For the same waveguide probe operated as the radiometer antenna, radiometric weighting factors associated with individual tissue cells are then derived from the FDTD calculated field values. Near field radiating characteristics of the probe and radiometric signals determined for tumors of various size and depth are discussed. The presence of the skin is found to result in a lower power transmission coefficient across the probe aperture and significantly lower absorbed powers by fat; both of these contribute to the much lower radiometric signals observed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8938/00392917.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.392917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.392917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD analysis of the radiometric temperature measurement of a bilayered biological tissue using a body-contacting waveguide probe","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Radiometry","Temperature measurement","Probes","Skin","Neoplasms","Rectangular waveguides","Biological tissues","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","temperature measurement","microwave measurement","radiometry","probes","rectangular waveguides","biomedical measurement","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD analysis","radiometric temperature measurement","bilayered biological tissue","body-contacting waveguide probe","open-ended rectangular waveguide probe","direct contact technique","two-layer tissue model","outer thin skin layer","semi-infinite fat layer","X-band total power radiometer","spherical tumor","active probe characteristics","sinusoidally time-varying TE/sub 10/ type","excitation source","radiometer antenna","radiometric weighting factors","near field radiating characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"FDTD analysis of the radiometric temperature measurement of a bilayered biological tissue using a body-contacting waveguide probe","volume":"43","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5035129","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD analysis of the radiometric temperature measurement of a bilayered biological tissue using a body-contacting waveguide probe","sourcePdf":"00392917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053392S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","articleId":"392917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":392918,"authors":[{"name":"F.M.

Within the last five years the necessity of turning their attention away from the military sector towards commercial products has caused more and more companies to look at millimeterwave communications and automotive radar. By chance, this was accompanied by the advent of low-cost integration procedures, i.e., hybrid- and monolithic-integration techniques, respectively. Thus, the necessary technology is mature and available now, opening a wide field of deployment areas. Millimeterwave systems have found an ever increasing interest, due to their specific advantages, as well as the lack of frequencies for new services. While the military market is decreasing, commercial applications in the area of microwave tags, radio communication, and traffic control are increasing rapidly. The two most important application areas right now are: 38 GHz short-haul transmission links for PCN installations, an already valuable niche market, and 77 GHz automotive radar sensors-simple collision warning devices and intelligent cruise control sensors as well-which have the largest market potential for the very near future.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.392935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8938","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00392935.png","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1653","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8938/00392935.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.392935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Commercial applications of millimeterwaves: history, present status, and future trends","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["History","Military communication","Automotive engineering","Intelligent sensors","Turning","Radar","Frequency","Microwave devices","Radio communication","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre waves","millimetre wave detectors","history","reviews","automotive electronics","traffic control","radar equipment","personal communication networks","microwave links","land mobile radio","cellular radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave applications","commercial applications","microwave tags","radiocommunication","traffic control","automotive radar sensors","MM-wave communications","short-haul transmission links","PCN installations","collision warning devices","intelligent cruise control sensors","EHF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Commercial applications of millimeterwaves: history, present status, and future trends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"43","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5024328","publicationDate":"July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Commercial applications of millimeterwaves: history, present status, and future trends","sourcePdf":"00392935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066145S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"197","articleId":"392935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":392947,"authors":[{"name":"F.

With the addition of filters and bypassing capacitors, the RF portion of the phone shares the same printed circuit board (PCB) as the DSP, CODEC, and logic ICs. The availability of such highly integrated 1.9-GHz RFICs requires the solution of many complex design, manufacturing, and test problems.

In this arrangement, access to the optical medium for the network subscribers is provided via frequency-hopping (FH). The proposed FH technique in this analysis takes advantage of the Reed-Solomon (RS) codes to encode information packets and, consequently, to combat possible burst errors at the receiver. At user locations, encoded subpackets are frequency-hopped with the aid of a phase modulator, using a preassigned FH pattern for transmission over the optical medium. At the receiver site, a balanced phase discriminator/detection device followed by a frequency-dehopping receiver is used to recover the desired information. An alternative receiver structure, where the received signal is heterodyned prior to dehopping, is also proposed. The implications of this coherent detection are consequently discussed. Performance measures in terms of throughput and probability of incorrect decoding for chip synchronous model with asynchronous transmission characteristic in the absence of side information are obtained to assess the viability of the proposed packet-switched fiber-optic multiple-access communication system. Numerical results are presented when short RS codes are utilized as FH assignment codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.392967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/8939/00392967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.392967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8939","startPage":"2241","endPage":"2253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of packet-switched fiber-optic frequency-hopping multiple-access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of packet-switched fiber-optic frequency-hopping multiple-access networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5013145","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of packet-switched fiber-optic frequency-hopping multiple-access networks","sourcePdf":"392967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043641S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","articleId":"392967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":392968,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Spur reduction is accomplished through dithering amplitude and phase values prior to wordlength reduction. The analytical approach developed for analog quantization is used to produce new bounds on spur performance in these dithered systems. Amplitude dithering allows output wordlength reduction without introducing additional spurs. Effects of periodic dither similar to that produced by a pseudo-noise (PN) generator are analyzed. This phase dithering method provides a spur reduction of 6(M+1) dB per phase bit when the dither consists of M uniform variates. While the spur reduction is at the expense of an increase in system noise, the noise can be made white, making the noise power spectral density small. This technique permits the use of a smaller number of phase bits addressing sinusoid look-up tables, resulting in an exponential decrease in system complexity. Amplitude dithering allows the use of less complicated multipliers and narrower data paths in purely digital applications, as well as the use of coarse-resolution, highly-linear digital-to-analog converters (DAC's) to obtain spur performance limited by the DAC linearity rather than its resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.392968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.392968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/8939/00392968.pdf","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2262","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00392968.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spur-reduced digital sinusoid synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Spur-reduced digital sinusoid synthesis","volume":"43","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5013146","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spur-reduced digital sinusoid synthesis","sourcePdf":"392968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036545S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","articleId":"392968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":392969,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

This is particularly true in a frequency selective environment where an adaptive equalizer may be required. In this paper, a frequency offset estimation algorithm is presented which is based on applying a nonlinear operation on the received sampled baseband signal. Tones at multiples of the clock frequency are produced and the phases of these tones provide both the desired frequency offset and clock phase information. This algorithm is intended to operate without knowledge of the pulse shape and therefore may be suitable for frequency selective environments. Additionally, the clock phase may be estimated with very little overhead.

These field trials are for mobile unit geolocation systems and adaptive phased array \"smart antenna\" applications. The geolocation system trials are in response to the demand for high confidence geolocation of mobile units for enhanced emergency 911 service and for use in the US Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (NHS) initiative. The smart antenna array application addresses the cellular service providers' need for more user channel capacity and/or geographic coverage from existing base station installations. Software radio architectures were selected because of their ability to provide superior performance at low life cycle cost. These systems use 4 to 8 wideband coherent channels and fully characterize the arriving RF energy to either geolocate the emitter or to maximize the carrier-to-interference ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/8941/00392997.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.392997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.392997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=392997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction finding and \"smart antennas\" using software radio architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directive antennas","Software radio","Adaptive arrays","Antenna arrays","Phased arrays","Application software","Software testing","System testing","Performance evaluation","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio direction-finding","cellular radio","land mobile radio","radio equipment","adaptive antenna arrays","antenna phased arrays","automated highways","channel capacity","digital radio","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart antennas","software radio architectures","800 MHz mobile cellular radio band","mobile unit geolocation systems","adaptive phased array smart antenna applications","geolocation system trials","emergency 911 service","US Department of Transportation Intelligent Vehicle Highway System","channel capacity","geographic coverage","base station installations","wideband coherent channels","arriving RF energy","carrier-to-interference ratio","800 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/392997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Direction finding and \"smart antennas\" using software radio architectures","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4969567","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction finding and \"smart antennas\" using software radio architectures","sourcePdf":"00392997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089009S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"66","articleId":"392997","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":392998,"authors":[{"name":"R.I.

The feature vectors used consist of acoustic backscatter as a function of angle of incidence. Simulated seafloor backscatter is obtained by employing the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff approximation and the statistical properties of bottom reverberation. These synthetic data are used initially to train multilayer perceptrons and then to test them for their ability to discriminate among signal returns produced by seafloors with different roughness parameters. The same data are also processed with optimum Bayesian classifiers. A comparison of the results indicates a suboptimum performance for the perceptrons. The same procedures are applied to real data collected by the Sea Beam bathymetric system over two Central North Pacific seamounts. In this case, the perceptron performance is similar to that of the statistical classifier, which is no longer optimum, since no prior knowledge of the probability distribution parameters is available. In addition, Self Organizing Maps are applied to both synthetic and real data and are shown to result in a successful separation of the output space into distinct regions corresponding to different seafloor classes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.393074","startPage":"190","endPage":"197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/8943/00393074.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.393074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural and statistical classifiers to the problem of seafloor characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sea floor","Backscatter","Reverberation","Multilayer perceptrons","Acoustic testing","Sea floor roughness","Bayesian methods","Acoustic beams","Probability distribution","Self organizing feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oceanographic techniques","geophysical techniques","seafloor phenomena","backscatter","Bayes methods","self-organising feature maps","geophysical signal processing","multilayer perceptrons","acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical classifiers","seafloor characterization","simulated seafloor backscatter","Helmholtz-Kirchhoff approximation","statistical properties","bottom reverberation","synthetic data","multilayer perceptrons","signal returns","roughness parameters","optimum Bayesian classifiers","suboptimum performance","Sea Beam bathymetric system","Central North Pacific seamounts","perceptron performance","statistical classifier","probability distribution","Self Organizing Maps"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural and statistical classifiers to the problem of seafloor characterization","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5013154","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural and statistical classifiers to the problem of seafloor characterization","sourcePdf":"00393074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061276S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"41","articleId":"393074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":393077,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, an on-line adaptation method \"Imaginary Training\" is proposed to improve the time-consuming adaptation process of the original SONCS. The Imaginary Training can be realized by a parallel structure which enables the SONCS to adjust the controller network independently of actual operation of the controlled object. The SONCS is divided into two separate parts: the Real-World Part where the controlled object is operated according to the objective, and the Imaginary-World Part where the Imaginary Training is carried out. In order to adjust the controller network by the Imaginary Training, it is necessary to introduce a forward model network which can generate simulated state variables without involving actual data. A neural network \"Identification Network\" which has a specific structure to simulate the behavior of dynamical systems is proposed as the forward model network. The effectiveness of the Imaginary Training is demonstrated by applying to the heading keeping control of an AUV \"Twin-Burger\". It is shown that the SONCS adjusts the controller network-through on-line processes in parallel with the actual operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.393077","startPage":"221","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/8943/00393077.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.393077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-line adaptation method in a neural network based control system for AUVs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Control systems","Underwater vehicles","Vehicle dynamics","Sliding mode control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Programmable control","Velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","adaptive control","learning (artificial intelligence)","online operation","computerised control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online adaptation","neural network","AUV","adaptive control","Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","Imaginary Training","time-consuming adaptation","parallel structure","forward model network","simulated state variables","dynamical systems","effectiveness","heading keeping control","Twin-Burger","controller network-through on-line processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"An on-line adaptation method in a neural network based control system for AUVs","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5013157","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-line adaptation method in a neural network based control system for AUVs","sourcePdf":"00393077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076296S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"71","articleId":"393077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":393093,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Expressions are obtained for the mutual coherence function of an incoherent source when the signals are discrete in time and space and have finite lengths. Expressions are also obtained for statistics and effective signal-to-noise ratios that describe the error in the assumption of an incoherent source with finite signal lengths. Images of a one-dimensional source are reconstructed for different signal lengths and different pulse windows. The results show that ultrasonic signals with a relatively long effective length are needed to satisfy the incoherence requirement for image reconstruction based on the van Cittert-Zernike theorem. Consequently, although the van Cittert-Zernike theorem may be used to estimate the coherence length of ultrasonic signals in the aperture of an imaging system, special data acquisition techniques are needed for satisfactory reconstruction of ultrasonic images when depth resolution like that in current b-scans is required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8944/00393102.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.393102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.393102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"About the application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem in ultrasonic imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Image reconstruction","Apertures","Optical imaging","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical distortion","Radio astronomy","Image analysis","Image resolution","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic imaging","image reconstruction","coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["van Cittert-Zernike theorem","ultrasonic imaging","mutual coherence function","incoherent source","statistics","signal-to-noise ratios","one-dimensional source","image reconstruction","signal lengths","pulse windows","aperture","data acquisition","depth resolution","b-scans"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"About the application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem in ultrasonic imaging","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5036126","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"About the application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem in ultrasonic imaging","sourcePdf":"393102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06928S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"37","articleId":"393102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":393110,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The estimator's output can be calculated by evaluating the 2D autocorrelation function of the demodulated (baseband) backscattered echoes at two lags. A full derivation and mathematical description of the estimator is presented, based on the framework of the 2D Fourier transform. The same framework is adopted to analyze two other established velocity estimators (the conventional 1D autocorrelator and the crosscorrelator) in a unifying manner, and theoretical arguments as well as experimental results are used to highlight the common aspects of all three estimators. In addition, a thorough performance evaluation is carried out by means of extensive simulations, which document the effect of a number of factors (velocity spread, range gate length, ensemble length, noise level, transmitted bandwidth) and provide an insight into the optimum parameters and trade-offs associated with individual algorithms. Overall, the 2D autocorrelator is shown to offer the best performance in the context of the specific simulation conditions considered here. Its superiority over the crosscorrelator is restricted to cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. However, the 2D autocorrelator always outperforms the conventional 1D autocorrelator by a significant margin. These comparisons, when linked to the computational requirements of the proposed estimator, suggest that it combines the generally higher performance of 2D broadband time-domain techniques with the relatively modest complexity of 1D narrowband phase-domain velocity estimators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.393110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8944/00393110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.393110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8944","startPage":"672","endPage":"688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An axial velocity estimator for ultrasound blood flow imaging, based on a full evaluation of the Doppler equation by means of a two-dimensional autocorrelation approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An axial velocity estimator for ultrasound blood flow imaging, based on a full evaluation of the Doppler equation by means of a two-dimensional autocorrelation approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5036134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An axial velocity estimator for ultrasound blood flow imaging, based on a full evaluation of the Doppler equation by means of a two-dimensional autocorrelation approach","sourcePdf":"393110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044315S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"311","articleId":"393110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":393111,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The evaluation also encompasses the well-established 1D autocorrelation technique for velocity estimation and its corresponding power estimator (1D zero-lag autocorrelator), to allow performance comparisons under identical conditions. Clutter-suppressed in vitro data sets from a steady-flow system are used to document the effect of the range gate and ensemble length, noise level and angle of insonation on the precision of the velocity estimates. The same data sets are used to examine issues related to the estimation of the Doppler signal's power. The first-order statistics of power estimates from regions corresponding to flow and noise are determined experimentally and the ability of power-based thresholding to separate flow signals from noise is characterized by means of ROC analysis. In summary, the results of the in vitro evaluation show that the proposed 2D-autocorrelation form of processing is consistently better than the corresponding 1D-autocorrelation techniques, in terms of both velocity and power estimation. Therefore, given their relatively modest implementation requirements, the 2D-autocorrelation algorithms for velocity and power estimation appear to represent a superior, yet realistic, alternative to conventional Doppler processing for color flow mapping.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.393111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8944/00393111.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.393111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8944","startPage":"689","endPage":"699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation of velocity and power estimation for ultrasound blood flow imaging, by means of a two-dimensional autocorrelation approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation of velocity and power estimation for ultrasound blood flow imaging, by means of a two-dimensional autocorrelation approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5036135","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation of velocity and power estimation for ultrasound blood flow imaging, by means of a two-dimensional autocorrelation approach","sourcePdf":"393111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104975S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"120","articleId":"393111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":393115,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Lai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Dong-Lai Liu","id":"37087167142"},{"name":"R.C.

The measurements were employed to emulate data in one dimension by summing waveforms in the elevation direction after a geometric correction was performed using a fourth-order polynomial fit to the surface of arrival time. Distortion calculation and time-shift compensation were performed independently on waveforms in the one-dimensional and two-dimensional apertures and the waveforms were focussed using a Fourier transform method to obtain the point-spread function in the central elevation plane. The results show that distortion is smoothed increasingly by one-dimensional apertures as the elevation dimension grows and that the smoothing is substantial for elevations similar to those employed in present clinical imagers. The results also show that one-dimensional compensation becomes less effective than two-dimensional compensation as the size of the elevation increases but that one-dimensional compensation performs almost as well as two-dimensional compensation in apertures with elevations like those in current imaging systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.393115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.393115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8944","startPage":"726","endPage":"733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/8944/00393115.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393115","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Distortion measurement","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Humans","Abdomen","Time measurement","Performance evaluation","Polynomials","Surface waves","Surface fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic wavefront distortion","two-dimensional apertures","one-dimensional apertures","human abdominal wall","time-shift compensation","Fourier transform","point-spread function","clinical imaging","elevation","geometric correction","polynomial"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of ultrasonic wavefront distortion and compensation in one-dimensional and two-dimensional apertures","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5036139","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393115/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of ultrasonic wavefront distortion and compensation in one-dimensional and two-dimensional apertures","sourcePdf":"393115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025178S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"19","articleId":"393115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":393117,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

Starting with the Poise system in the early 1980s, we visited issues such as office automation and the paperless office. We showed that office information systems such as Poise suffered from procedural rigidity, resulting in limited applicability. Knowledge-based techniques then emerged to meet these limitations. The successor to Poise was Polymer, a task support system built upon a plan-based expert system. D-Polymer, the distributed version, followed, expanding the scope of Polymer to multiple users (workgroups). D-Polymer used techniques from distributed artificial intelligence for multiagent coordination. A parallel trend in workgroup support in the late 1980s and early 1990s was the tool perspective that heavily influenced CSCW systems. The tool perspective viewed systems such as D-Polymer as overly complex, favoring highly user-centered tools. Acknowledging the contributions of the tool perspective, we developed D-Polymer to address workflow issues. The most recent member in the Poise/Polymer line of research is Polyflow. This workflow system uses the power of goal-based knowledge representation to assist in planning, monitoring, and repairing workflows with emphasis on the users and their workgroups.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","pdfPath":"/iel3/64/8945/00393142.pdf","doi":"10.1109/64.393142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/64.393142","startPage":"41","endPage":"47","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From office automation to intelligent workflow systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393142/","displayDocTitle":"From office automation to intelligent workflow systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5024964","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From office automation to intelligent workflow systems","sourcePdf":"00393142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158749S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"19","articleId":"393142","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":393181,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

Transverse single-mode emitting devices show a record low emission linewidth of 30 MHz and a linewidth-power product of 2.2 mW/spl middot/MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/8946/00393188.pdf","startPage":"730","endPage":"732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.393188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.393188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8946","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of planar Be-doped InGaAs VCSEL's with two-sided output","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indium gallium arsenide","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","Threshold current","Threshold voltage","Power generation","Power lasers","Surface emitting lasers","Optical modulation","Epitaxial layers","Mirrors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indium compounds","gallium arsenide","aluminium compounds","beryllium","III-V semiconductors","quantum well lasers","surface emitting lasers","ion implantation","semiconductor doping","laser mirrors","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VCSEL optimization","two-sided output","low threshold current densities","output power","wall-plug efficiency","operating voltage","InGaAs-AlGaAs planar vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers","p-doped Bragg reflector","interface grading","modulation doping","planar Be doping","optimized p-doped mirrors VCSEL","low driving voltage","transverse single-mode emitting devices","emission linewidth","linewidth-power product","InGaAs strained quantum wells","planar proton implantation","solid source MBE","1.6 V","17.6 percent","10 mum","AlGaAs:Be-GaAs","In/sub 0.2/Ga/sub 0.8/As-Al/sub 0.3/Ga/sub 0.7/As","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of planar Be-doped InGaAs VCSEL's with two-sided output","volume":"7","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5019769","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of planar Be-doped InGaAs VCSEL's with two-sided output","sourcePdf":"00393188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028164S","chronDate":"July  1995","isNumber":"8946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"30","articleId":"393188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":393196,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An important goal of the Futures Lab project is to understand how to incorporate advanced display and media server systems into scientific computing environments. The objective is to create new collaborative environment technologies that combine advanced networking, virtual-space technology, and high-end virtual environments to construct virtual teams for scientific research. We hope to add new capabilities to scientific computing systems and to accelerate development of virtual organizations to conduct experimental, computational, and theoretical science. Our research focuses largely on developing new technology and integrating it with selected applications projects to demonstrate the technology. We want to drive large-scale supercomputer systems architecture toward more balanced (and human-oriented) systems that support a variety of human interfaces and media systems. Large-scale parallel computing and immersive technology are naturally complementary, so we are striving to develop improved mechanisms for linking parallel supercomputers and immersive displays. The collaborative environments we envision are logical extensions of the classic Internet. The Futures Lab and its associated research projects are a new research focus for Argonne's Mathematics and Computer Science Division. Our approach is both interdisciplinary and collaborative. Two primary projects-the multimedia and collaborative space project and the virtual environments project-are under way, both supported by activities in advanced networking.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Parallel & Distributed Technology: Systems & Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Parallel & Distributed Technology: Systems & Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/88/8947/00393228.pdf","doi":"10.1109/88.393228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/88.393228","startPage":"14","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing the future of collaborative science: Argonne's Futures Laboratory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393228/","displayDocTitle":"Designing the future of collaborative science: Argonne's Futures Laboratory","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5026295","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Summer 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing the future of collaborative science: Argonne's Futures Laboratory","sourcePdf":"00393228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069385S","chronDate":"Summer 1995","isNumber":"8947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"88","citationCount":"9","articleId":"393228","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":393230,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

DAVE is unique in that it provides a distributed plug-and-play application programming interface, is object-oriented, offers device and media extensibility, uses traditional Unix network facilities for transmission, and employs existing audio and video hardware commonly found on many workstations. To demonstrate DAVE's usefulness, we used it to develop two multimedia applications applicable to collaborative engineering: desktop videoconferencing and video broadcasting/receiving. DAVE's object-oriented techniques provide a high level of abstraction for devices. Application developers can treat media devices (such as cameras and microphones) as distributed resources, much as workstations treat graphics and windows. This flexibility and accessibility lets developers easily integrate multimedia into existing distributed environments. Through inheritance and data independence, developers can define additional devices and media types and integrate them into the environment. This plug-and-play approach provides easy access for application developers who want to avoid learning the details of media devices or who want to dynamically change their applications at runtime.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer 1995","publicationDate":"Summer 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5026296","volume":"3","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DAVE: a plug-and-play model for distributed multimedia application development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DAVE: a plug-and-play model for distributed multimedia application development","sourcePdf":"00393230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04321S","chronDate":"Summer 1995","isNumber":"8947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"88","articleId":"393230","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":393303,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The use of the periodic properties of powers of two taken modulo 2/sup a/+1 simplifies the result correction process and permits a highly regular circuit structure which is suitable for VLSI implementation. Since the multiplier is almost exclusively composed of full and half adders, it can easily be pipelined with throughput reaching hundreds of megahertz.

A cyclic redundancy code (CRC) is employed to generate FCS at one end and check the entire received message (data plus FCS) at the other end. This is the case of frame relay for instance. Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) even go further not only protecting either the entire message or each cell but also all cell headers that carry routing information. This raises the need for a simple and fast method to calculate CRC.

BIC sensors are used to monitor the power-bus static current of these circuits to detect excessive current consumption. This excessive static current consumption is compared to a predefined reference value in order to detect radiation-induced multiple parametric failures and system power supply breakdown. BIC sensors can also be affected by these faults and the reliability of the system can be lost. However, we show that the proposed current sensor is strongly code disjoint (SCD) with respect to the above faults and the system reliability is guaranteed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1993.393307","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3140/8949/00393307.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1993.393307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quiescent current monitoring to improve the reliability of electronic systems in space radiation environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393307/","displayDocTitle":"Quiescent current monitoring to improve the reliability of electronic systems in space radiation environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4955941","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quiescent current monitoring to improve the reliability of electronic systems in space radiation environments","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00393307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039322S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3140","citationCount":"6","articleId":"393307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":393319,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, traditional SPICE like simulators or even mixed-mode simulators are too slow for the task of simulating the effects of /spl alpha/-particle hits on relatively large circuits. Gate-level simulators offer tremendous speedup over these electrical level simulators, but they are only as good as the model which captures the /spl alpha/-particle effect at the logic level. The goal of this research is to develop a computationally efficient model which captures the behavior of the /spl alpha/-particle at the logic level. This model can then be used in a gate-level timing simulator to propagate the /spl alpha/-particle effects to the latches and the outputs of the circuit under simulation. We have developed a closed form solution to approximate the logic pulse waveform resulting from /spl alpha/-particle hits. As is presented in the paper, the model tracks the data from SPICE simulations remarkably well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1993.393319","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3140/8949/00393319.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1993.393319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A logic-level model for /spl alpha/-particle hits in CMOS circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393319/","displayDocTitle":"A logic-level model for /spl alpha/-particle hits in CMOS circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4955929","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A logic-level model for /spl alpha/-particle hits in CMOS circuits","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00393319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025957S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3140","citationCount":"51","articleId":"393319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":393327,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The system consists of 64 processing units interconnected in a three-dimensional (3D) mesh network with the help of bi-directional free-space optical interconnects. Theoretical analysis of signal delay and wiring congestion characteristics in the 3-D mesh network using free-space optical interconnects concludes that the network is superior to that using a conventional backplane interconnects. In the prototype system, signal transmission of all 96 free-space optical interconnects is stable even after repeated extraction and insertion of the processor boards, and system operation without error for 100 h is performed.

A self-tuned system has an adjustable clock and measurement logic. During the tuning process the adjustable clock is made to run faster and faster until before the system fails. After tuning and during operation each cycle is measured and, if a failure is imminent, the system is retuned. During the tuning phase test vectors-either hardware embedded or software-select near maximum speed for a particular instance of the system. As self-tuning is predicated on self-test, it is essential to build in self-test features. These same self-test features are useful in circuit level performance monitoring. Two extremes on the continuum of self-tuning are discussed: at one extreme is purely hardware self-tuning and at the other, nearly purely software. Data is given from an experimental self-tuned primary memory indicating 70 ns access time DRAM can be operated at 45 ns or less.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware self-tuning and circuit performance monitoring","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1993.393383","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3140/8949/00393383.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1993.393383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8949","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Hardware self-tuning and circuit performance monitoring","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4955865","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware self-tuning and circuit performance monitoring","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00393383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033793S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3140","citationCount":"22","articleId":"393383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":393387,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The fault effects include redundant faults and state oscillations. Input/output redundancy is a special feature of STGASLCs which relaxes the fundamental mode in HMASLCs.

As a result, memory management overhead is significant. The paper evaluates an application-specific coprocessor architecture to speed up object creation and memory reclamation in object-oriented systems. The architecture supports a bit-vector approach to dynamic storage allocation and liberation. Newly created objects reside in a cache which is reference counted. The paper presents measurements of the performance of this coprocessor design. Simulation results show that 50% to 70% of objects die before they age out of the cache, greatly reducing the number of references to main memory. Overall, more than 60% of memory traffic is saved by the proposed scheme, and the interval between main-memory garbage collections is extended by more than 60%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Memory management","Hardware","Internet","Computer architecture","Innovation management","Costs","Contracts","Frequency","Computer languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented programming","object-oriented methods","storage management","coprocessors","computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-caching coprocessor design","object-oriented systems","object creation","memory management overhead","application-specific coprocessor architecture","memory reclamation","bit-vector approach","dynamic storage allocation","memory traffic","main-memory garbage collections"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1993.393393","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD'93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3140/8949/00393393.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1993.393393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of an object-caching coprocessor design for object-oriented systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of an object-caching coprocessor design for object-oriented systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393393/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4955855","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of an object-caching coprocessor design for object-oriented systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00393393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04121S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3140","citationCount":"8","articleId":"393393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":393497,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The co-processor can be used for sophisticated static scheduling as well as for online scheduling using many different algorithms such as earliest deadline first, highest value first, or the Spring scheduling algorithm. When such an algorithm is used online it is important to assess the performance impact of the interface of the co-processor to the host system, in this case, the Spring kernel. We focus on the interface and its implications for overall scheduling performance. We show that the current VLSI chip speeds up the main portion of the scheduling operation by over three orders of magnitude and speeds up the overall scheduling operation 30 fold. The parallel VLSI architecture for scheduling is briefly presented. This architecture can be scaled for different numbers of tasks, resources, and internal word lengths. The implementation uses an advanced clocking scheme to allow further scaling using future IC technologies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3143/8952/00393510.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","publicationTitle":"1993 Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1993.393510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1993.393510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Spring scheduling co-processor: Design, use, and performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Springs","Coprocessors","Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Optimal scheduling","Very large scale integration","Kernel","Dynamic scheduling","Computer science","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor scheduling","scheduling","real-time systems","multiprocessing systems","performance evaluation","online operation","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI co-processor","real-time multiprocessor scheduling","static scheduling","online scheduling","earliest deadline first","highest value first","Spring scheduling algorithm","performance","interface","scheduling performance","VLSI chip","parallel VLSI architecture","tasks","resources","internal word lengths","advanced clocking scheme","IC technologies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"The Spring scheduling co-processor: Design, use, and performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4951329","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Spring scheduling co-processor: Design, use, and performance","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00393510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051168S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1993","isNumber":"8952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3143","citationCount":"11","articleId":"393510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":393513,"authors":[{"name":"T.-W.

The correctness of SSP schedules is justified by the concept of similarity which allows different but sufficiently timely data to be used in a computation without adversely affecting the outcome.

We give a schedulability bound for SSP and also report simulation results which show that SSP is especially useful for scheduling real-time data access on multiprocessor systems.

We present a new optimistic concurrency control algorithm that can avoid such unnecessary restarts by adjusting serialization order dynamically, and demonstrate that the new algorithm outperforms the previous ones over a wide range of system workload.

Each node simulates vehicles on its local terrain partition. Vehicles communicate with sets of nearby vehicles within a given radius r, a region called the communication circle. A message is sent (i.e. consumes network bandwidth) unless the communication circle is local-that is, entirely within the originating node's terrain partition. The algorithm continuously accomplishes two (somewhat contradictory) goals: (I) dynamic load balancing through repartitioning the terrain via swaps of small discrete terrain parcels and vehicles therein, and (2) maximizing the proportion of communication circles that are local and thus require no network bandwidth.

In this paper, we show that optimistic execution can also be used to parallelize program control structures. We discuss the requirements for handling unbounded constructs and demonstrate the need for a flexible time-stamp allocation scheme. We present a scheme using variable-length time-stamps which allows an arbitrary number of time-stamps to be generated between any pair of existing time-stamps. The ordering relation defined for these time-stamps is similar to that for fractional numbers: for two consecutive numbers of a given length it is always possible to generate a number whose value falls between them. Optimizations which improve the efficiency of time-stamp allocation for typical program structures are presented, together with an analysis of the cost. We show that the size of time-stamps is manageable even for programs with large, complex, control structures. Finally, we give an example of the use of time-stamps in parallelizing a simple control structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Apr 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4940253","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Time-stamp generation for optimistic parallel computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-stamp generation for optimistic parallel computing","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00393585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039274S","chronDate":"9-13 Apr 1995","isNumber":"8954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3145","citationCount":"4","articleId":"393585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":393663,"authors":[{"name":"D.

For each filter gain, the time complexity of the algorithm is a second-order polynomial in the filter order and is a first-order polynomial in the filter wordlength. Unlike conventional methods where each coefficient is allocated a fixed number of SPT terms, the author's method allows the number of SPT terms for each coefficient to vary subject to the number of SPT terms for the entire filter. This provides the possibility of finding a better filter without increasing the number of adders, which determines the realization cost for a given filter length. Application of the algorithm to finite impulse response (FIR) filter designs shows that it achieves up to 8.9 dB improvement over simulated annealing and mixed integer linear programing on the normalized peak ripples of example filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/1067/8956/00393663.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"87 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A polynomial-time algorithm for designing digital filters with power-of-two coefficients","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Algorithm design and analysis","Digital filters","Finite impulse response filter","Simulated annealing","Nonlinear filters","Extraterrestrial measurements","Costs","Mixed integer linear programming","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomials","digital filters","FIR filters","computational complexity","adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial-time algorithm","digital filters","power-of-two coefficients","signed power-of-two","filter gain","time complexity","second-order polynomial","filter order","first-order polynomial","filter wordlength","adders","realization cost","filter length","finite impulse response","normalized peak ripples"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"A polynomial-time algorithm for designing digital filters with power-of-two coefficients","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4978480","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A polynomial-time algorithm for designing digital filters with power-of-two coefficients","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00393663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027836S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","citationCount":"40","articleId":"393663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":393664,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

A multi-rate technique is proposed that achieves a typical throughput rate of 30 MHz with hardware that is sampling only at a 5 MHz rate. This achieved by using a frequency-sampling-like structure to divide the incoming spread-spectrum signal into five frequency bands and then processing in each of these small frequency bands at a lower sampling rate. These low-sampling-rate filters consist of an array of complex arithmetic bandpass filters that can be placed anywhere on the unit circle. These bandpass filters are monitored by the adaptive algorithm to detect when the energy in that band exceeds the value expected for the BPSK signal. When this occurs, narrow band interference is detected. A simple algorithm is used to subtract the output of the bandpass filter from the input to generate a notch at the interference frequency, thus attenuating the interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393676","startPage":"136","endPage":"139 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/1067/8956/00393676.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive notch filtering using multi-rate frequency-sampling band-pass filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive notch filtering using multi-rate frequency-sampling band-pass filters","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4984941","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393676/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive notch filtering using multi-rate frequency-sampling band-pass filters","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00393676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031853S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","articleId":"393676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":393683,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It is shown that implementing an orthogonal finite impulse response filter bank over a finite signal segment involves finding a set of orthogonal boundary filters, and that by carrying out a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure boundary filters are generated that necessarily remain localized in the region of the boundary. A complete constructive characterization of such boundaries is given for two-channel finite impulse response filter banks. These boundary constructions allow changing the topology of orthogonal subband trees at will, by growing or pruning branches at any time. The boundary filter case can be further generalized to give overlapping transition filters when changing between orthogonal structures. If the time-varying filter banks are used in an iterated scheme, they converge to continuous-time bases, much as in the non-time-varying case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4991202","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal time-varying filter banks and wavelets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal time-varying filter banks and wavelets","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00393740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027631S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","citationCount":"21","articleId":"393740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":393757,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

This method named discrete wavelet vector transform quantization (DWVTQ) is a coding system in which the speech signal is transformed into wavelet coefficients corresponding to different frequency bands which are vector quantized separately. The proposed implementation uses product code structure for each frequency band. The bit assignment of vector codes is adapted taking into account both the statistics of the wavelet coefficients and the fact that the human ear is less sensitive in the high-frequency bands. Vector quantization design procedures for discrete wavelet transformed speech and simulation results are presented. These results show the efficiency of DWVTQ over discrete wavelet scalar transform quantization (DWSTQ) of the transformed speech, and improvement of the optimal bit allocation in comparison to uniform bit allocation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint wavelet transform and vector quantization for speech coding","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393817","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/1067/8956/00393817.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"702 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=393817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Joint wavelet transform and vector quantization for speech coding","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4991279","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint wavelet transform and vector quantization for speech coding","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00393817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057493S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","citationCount":"1","articleId":"393817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":393820,"authors":[{"name":"G.-S.

Using the Rm amplifier, a new transresistance-capacitor (Rm-C) differentiator is designed. Considering the intrinsic capacitances of the MOS transistors as filter elements, the Rm-C configuration can be regarded as a very high frequency (VHF) bandpass biquad filter with the center frequency mainly depending on the differentiating capacitor value. The center frequency can be finely tuned by varying the r/sub m/ value of the tunable Rm amplifier. Without loading degradation, cascading the Rm-C biquads can enhance the quality factor Q of the filter. Simulation results indicate the capability of the proposed new filter implementation method to realize a VHF bandpass biquad with the center frequency as high as 100 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1993.393890","startPage":"990","endPage":"993 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1067/8956/00393890.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VHF bandpass filter design using CMOS transresistance amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"VHF bandpass filter design using CMOS transresistance amplifiers","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4991352","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393890/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VHF bandpass filter design using CMOS transresistance amplifiers","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00393890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027595S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","articleId":"393890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":393892,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These techniques include the use of negative feedback to reduce errors resulting from channel-length modulation and capacitive feedback, and fully-differential circuits with charge cancellation to reduce switch charge injection. It is argued that this piecemeal application of circuit techniques to suppress individual errors frequently carries penalties for silicon area, power dissipation, bandwidth and low supply voltage operation. An alternative approach is presented which attempts to enhance basic cell performance through successive refinement of the memorized sample. This is achieved in a two-step technique, called S/sup 2/ I, in which the input sample is coarsely memorized, a process which introduces a combination of all the normal errors, followed by detection and suppression of the combined errors. The circuit solution requires the addition to the basic memory cell of only two extra switches. The new cell carries little or none of the aforementioned penalties.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/393952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","publicationDate":"May 1993","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4991414","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"S/sup 2/I: a two-step approach to switched-currents","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"S/sup 2/I: a two-step approach to switched-currents","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00393952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084414S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","citationCount":"12","articleId":"393952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":393956,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The op-amp features rail-to-rail operation and has an input stage with a constant transconductance (g/sub m/) over the entire common-mode input range. The input stage consists of an n- and a p-MOS differential pair connected in parallel. The constant g/sub m/ is accomplished by regulating the tail-currents with the aid of an MOS translinear (MTL) circuit. The resulting g/sub m/ is constant within 5%. The common-source output stage employs a feedback circuit which also contains an MTL circuit. This feedback circuit ensures class AB operation and prevents the transistors in the output stage from cutting off. The op-amp isi realized in a semi-custom CMOS process with minimum channel lengths of 10/spl mu/m. Simulations show that the minimum supply voltage is less than 2.5 V. A unity gain bandwidth of 550 kHz and a DC voltage gain larger than 80 dB are feasible.

Architectures for partitioned coordinate rotations digital computer (CORDIC) units are proposed. They are described using the blockwidth of the partitioned data record as a parameter, and are suited for a possible automatic layout generation of such modules.

They are the word-level folded architecture and the bit-level folded or digit-serial architecture, for implementation of discrete wavelet transforms. In the word-level folded architecture, the computations of all wavelet levels are folded to the same low-pass and high-pass filters. The number of registers in the folded architecture is minimized by the use of generalized life time analysis. The advantage of the word-level folded architecture is low latency, and its drawbacks are increased hardware area, less than 100% hardware utilization, and complex routing and interconnection required by the converters used in this architecture. These drawbacks are eliminated in the alternate bit-level folded digit-serial architecture which requires simpler control circuits, routing, and interconnection, and achieves complete hardware utilization, at the expense of an increase in the system latency and some constraints on the wordlength. In latency-critical applications, the use of the word-level folded architecture is proposed.

Using the analogy between a floorplan and a resistive network, the length and width of an individual block of a floorplan are represented by the voltage and current of a branch in a resistive network of a certain topology. The floorplan area minimization problem becomes a resistive network synthesis problem with a given power dissipation. By applying network and graph theories, a systematic network analogy procedure is developed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for zero wasted area floorplan are also given. An optimal algorithm for solving the optimization problem is proposed by replacing the nonlinear equations with the linear ones.

The DRAM implements a new column redundancy scheme called the data line suppression (DLS) to achieve fast access time. The widely used redundancy method for DRAMs (the address suppression scheme) has the disadvantage that access time for the redundancy column is longer than the normal column. The new DLS scheme overcomes this problem. A full chip 64-Mb DRAM which incorporates the new redundancy scheme is designed and successfully fabricated. Measurements confirm that column access time (t/sub AA/) for both the normal and redundant column are identical.

The author found that it was still worth the effort to develop a library which separates the basic algorithm from the application code. Development of new applications can be faster and further optimizations to the simulation code will apply to all applications. Also it will be easier to port applications to specialized hardware.

The author carries out a stability analysis by studying the vector field associated with the state equations. Specifically he notes the directions of the vector field in certain convex, compact subregions of the state space, capitalizing on the fact that the differential equations are piecewise-linear and actually linear in the regions considered. A three cell CNN with an opposite-sign template is described by differential equations. Complete stability of the opposite-sign cellular neural network is established for a certain parameter range.

Its principle is to synthesize a neural network by growing layers based on using training results until the required results are achieved. Each layer is trained with the pocket algorithm and hidden neurons are added only when needed. The proposed algorithm has the following properties. 1) The architecture of the network is generated dynamically by the learning process algorithm and it is unnecessary to estimate the number of layers and the number of hidden neurons before training. The neuron activation function is hard limiting instead of sigmoidal. 2) The learning speed is faster than other algorithms, especially the backpropagation algorithm. After the neural network is fully trained the system error is absolutely zero. 3) This algorithm can classify both linear separable and linear nonseparable families, whereas the backpropagation algorithm will fail sometimes. Extensive numerical simulation studies of this algorithm have confirmed these properties and thus the proposed training strategy looks promising.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1993.394248","pdfPath":"/iel2/1067/8956/00394248.pdf","startPage":"2403","endPage":"2406 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1993.394248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new algorithm for training multilayer feedforward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for training multilayer feedforward neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5021327","publicationDate":"May 1993","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for training multilayer feedforward neural networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00394248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034587S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","citationCount":"1","articleId":"394248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":394252,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Implementations of annealing universally always use a monotone decreasing, or cooling, temperature schedule which is motivated by the algorithm's proof of optimality as well as analogies with statistical thermodynamics. The authors challenge this motivation: the fact that cooling schedules are optimal in theory is not related to the practical performance of the algorithm. The finding is based on a new best-so-far criterion for measuring the quality of annealing schedules. Motivated by studies of optimal schedules for small problems, highly nonstandard annealing schedules are studied for training of feedforward perceptron networks on a real-world sensor classification benchmark. Clear evidence is found that optimal schedules do not necessarily decrease monotonically to zero.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1993.394291","startPage":"2572","endPage":"2575 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1067/8956/00394291.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1993.394291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulated annealing of neural networks: The 'cooling' strategy reconsidered","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Neural networks","Cooling","Optimal scheduling","Temperature distribution","Thermodynamics","Samarium","Computer science","Binary search trees","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","feedforward neural nets","perceptrons","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","simulated annealing","intractable global optimizations","training","monotone decreasing","cooling","best-so-far criterion","annealing schedules","feedforward perceptron networks","real-world sensor classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Simulated annealing of neural networks: The 'cooling' strategy reconsidered","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 1993","accessionNumber":"5021370","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulated annealing of neural networks: The 'cooling' strategy reconsidered","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00394291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054926S","chronDate":"3-6 May 1993","isNumber":"8956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1067","articleId":"394291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":394292,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The results for the 1.9 GHz amplifier show a small-signal gain of 14.5 dB and noise figure of 1.5 dB with a 4 V supply while drawing only 3 mA. The LNA was also tested with a 3 V supply and with a current of 2 mA the measured gain and noise figure were 13.5 dB and 1.75 dB, respectively. Thus the LNA is compatible with the voltage requirements of the latest generation of 3 V CMOS logic circuits. The results for the 2.4 GHz LNA show a small-signal gain of 15 dB and a noise figure 1.8 dB drawing less than 5 mA from a single +5 volt supply.

In this paper, we derive the ordered statistics of the noise after ordering and develop a simple algorithm based on these ordered statistics. This algorithm consists of successive reprocessing stages. For each stage, the error performance can be evaluated. For short codes of lengths up to 64, the optimum bit error performance is achieved in two stages of reprocessing, with at most a computation complexity of o(K/sup 2/) constructed codewords. For longer codes three or more reprocessing stages are required to achieve optimum decoding. The proposed algorithm applies to any linear block code, does not require any data storage and is well suitable for parallel processing. Furthermore, the maximum number of computations required at each reprocessing stage is fixed, which prevents the overflow problem at low SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1994.394624","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3149/8959/00394624.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1994.394624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","startPage":"395","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","displayDocTitle":"Soft decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4956144","publicationDate":"1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00394624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036791S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","citationCount":"7","articleId":"394624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":394626,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The main problem in using high-order neural networks for a specific application is to decide a proper set of product terms. We apply genetic algorithms to this structure-adaptation problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1994.394675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1994.394675","startPage":"343","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3149/8959/00394675.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant-time neural decoders for some BCH codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394675/","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Constant-time neural decoders for some BCH codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4956093","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-time neural decoders for some BCH codes","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00394675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045798S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","citationCount":"1","articleId":"394675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":394676,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

Recall that the cycle code C(G) of a graph G is the binary linear block code of F/sub 2//sup N/ generated by the characteristic vectors of the cycles of G, where every one of the N edges is identified with a vector coordinate. Even though one of the first things to be uncovered about such codes is that they are not optimal for growing N (for instance because, for a given rate, their minimum distance cannot grow faster than a logarithm of N), their simple structural appeal has attracted extensive study in the early days of coding theory. Today, one of the remaining open questions about cycle codes of graphs is: \"for a given information rate R, what is the highest channel error probability that these codes can sustain, while achieving vanishing (with block length N) residual error probability after decoding?\" The authors give a precise answer to this question.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Tree graphs","Vectors","Information rates","Decoding","Size measurement","Block codes","Character generation","Displays","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","block codes","linear codes","binary sequences","probability","error statistics","coding errors","telecommunication channels","cyclic codes","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error-correcting code","cycle codes","graphs","binary symmetric channel","binary linear block code","characteristic vectors","vector coordinate","minimum distance","coding theory","information rate","channel error probability","block length","residual error probability","decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=394711","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1994.394711","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3149/8959/00394711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1994.394711","startPage":"307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the error-correcting capabilities of cycle codes of graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the error-correcting capabilities of cycle codes of graphs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4956057","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the error-correcting capabilities of cycle codes of graphs","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00394711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018516S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","citationCount":"1","articleId":"394711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":394712,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

Unfortunately, this is not always the case practically. We prove that the capacity drops to order of zero when stored vectors and probe vector have nonuniform distributions. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the influence of these distributions on the capacity. To improve the capacity of associative memory, the high-order Hopfield model was proposed by Psaltis, Park and Hong (1988) whose capacity is rigorously determined in this paper. As an alternative of the Hopfield associative memory, are introduce an s-order polynomial approximation of the projection rule and prove that its storage capacity is higher than that of the Hopfield associative memory with the same implementation complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of associative memory","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1994.394746","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3149/8959/00394746.pdf","startPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1994.394746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=394746","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of associative memory","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4956022","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of associative memory","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00394746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064923S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","citationCount":"1","articleId":"394746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":394764,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

For such systems the sequence estimator significantly outperforms the symbol-by-symbol detector, even when a certain form of equalization techniques is used. The key obstacle to the applicability of sequence estimator is its large complexity. Denote the channel memory length by /spl nu/ and alphabet size by m. Using a Viterbi-like implementation, the estimator with truncation depth /spl delta/ requires O(m/sup /spl nu/+1/) arithmetic operations per symbol, and O(/spl delta/m/sup /spl nu//) storage elements. In most practical situations, /spl delta/ is chosen such that /spl delta/=O(/spl nu/). We propose the lattice sequence estimator (LSE), which only requires O(/spl delta/)/sup 2/ arithmetic operations per symbol, and O(/spl delta/) storage elements. For simplicity, the multilevel PAM system is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Maximum likelihood estimation","Upper bound","Digital communication","Arithmetic","Bandwidth","Hamming weight","Partial response channels","Intersymbol interference","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","microwave links","pulse amplitude modulation","sequential estimation","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lattice sequence estimator","performance","transmission errors","intersymbol interference","equalization techniques","channel memory length","alphabet size","Viterbi-like estimator","truncation depth","arithmetic operations","storage elements","multilevel PAM system","digital microwave radio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1994.394796","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3149/8959/00394796.pdf","startPage":"176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1994.394796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the lattice sequence estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=394796","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the lattice sequence estimator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394796/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4939325","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the lattice sequence estimator","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00394796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077429S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","articleId":"394796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":394799,"authors":[{"name":"L.L.

The relative performance advantages in using CSI are generally established through assessment of the two extreme cases of perfect and no CSI. Typically, the more severe the fading the greater the predicted relative performance advantage of perfect CSI. Little work has been done, however, in the development and characterization of explicit estimation techniques for recovering CSI on representative fading channels. We present one such scheme based upon use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. More specifically, we pose the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding problem as an incomplete data problem which is easily solved using the EM algorithm. The resulting EM-based procedure provides an iterative scheme for simultaneous ML decoding and channel state estimation. We demonstrate through simulation that this scheme is capable of providing performance close to that predicted on the slow-fading Rician channel when perfect CSI is available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4922826","displayDocTitle":"An EM-based procedure for iterative maximum-likelihood decoding and simultaneous channel state estimation on slow-fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EM-based procedure for iterative maximum-likelihood decoding and simultaneous channel state estimation on slow-fading channels","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00394944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044845S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","citationCount":"3","articleId":"394944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":394963,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Both speech and image compression systems are strongly dependant on VQ. When increasingly exploiting the compression capabilities of VQ, we normally have to pay a price in terms of problems with channel robustness and complexity. We have proposed linear mappings of block codes (LMBC) as a technique well suited to deal with some of these problems. As the scheme includes both a block code and a mapping, it is not obvious how to do the design. We demonstrate several design methods that work well and discuss their properties.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1994.394981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959","startPage":"241","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3149/8959/00394981.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design methods for VQ by linear mappings of block codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/394981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design methods for VQ by linear mappings of block codes","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4973173","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design methods for VQ by linear mappings of block codes","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00394981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054782S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","citationCount":"7","articleId":"394981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":394983,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We construct several decomposable codes for which a multistage decoding up to the minimum distance can be employed. The dimensions of constructed codes are 47, 43 and 24 for length 63, and 52 and 32 for length 72. We also construct codes of length 64 as shortened codes of the codes with length 72.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1994.395086","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/3149/8959/00395086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1994.395086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8959","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","startPage":"471","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"27 June-1 July 1994","displayDocTitle":"The state complexity of trellis diagrams for a class of generalized concatenated codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4962206","publicationDate":"1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The state complexity of trellis diagrams for a class of generalized concatenated codes","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"00395086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062652S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3149","citationCount":"5","articleId":"395086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":395116,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

The standard single scan JPDA algorithm updates a track with weighted sum of the measurements which could have reasonably originated from the target in track. The only information the standard JPDA algorithm uses is the measurements on the present scan and the state vectors and covariance matrices of the present targets. The n-scan-back algorithm presented here uses multiple scans of measurements along with the present target information to produce better weights for data association. The standard JPDA algorithm can utilize a formidable amount of processing power and the n-scan-back version only worsens the problem. Therefore, along with the algorithm presentation, implementations which make this algorithm practical are discussed and referenced. An example is also shown for a few n-scan-back window lengths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.395216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.395216","startPage":"1204","endPage":"1210","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/8964/00395216.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple scan joint probabilistic data association","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Multiple scan joint probabilistic data association","publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5007071","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395216/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple scan joint probabilistic data association","sourcePdf":"00395216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032523S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"25","articleId":"395216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":395219,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Due to the nonlinear characteristics of these loads, significant harmonic voltages and currents are produced on the electrical distribution system. Measurements were made with a harmonic analyzer at several locations in an electrical distribution system to quantify harmonic currents and voltages. The system impedance diagram, prepared from the system one line diagram, was used to model the electrical system and calculate power system natural frequencies. Calculations indicated harmonic resonance occurs near the seventh harmonic frequency depending on configuration of the electrical power system. The plant equivalent circuit was prepared for several harmonic frequencies to show the amplification of currents and voltages due to the effects of harmonic resonance. Calculations to determine network harmonics are presented using a simplified system representation in combination with traditional circuit reduction methods. The results of these calculations are shown to be valid by actual system measurement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.395273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.395273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8965","startPage":"682","endPage":"690","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/8965/00395273.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=395273","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Industrial plants","Power system harmonics","Voltage","Power system modeling","Frequency","Switches","Induction motors","Current measurement","Electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial power systems","power system harmonics","load (electric)","circuit resonance","distribution networks","power system measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial plants","electrical load","computer equipment","switch mode power supplies","AC induction motor","nonlinear characteristics","harmonic currents","harmonic voltages","electrical distribution system","measurements","harmonic analyzer","impedance diagram","natural frequencies","harmonic resonance","seventh harmonic frequency","electrical power system","equivalent circuit","circuit reduction methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic resonance at a medium-sized industrial plant","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5018525","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395273/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic resonance at a medium-sized industrial plant","sourcePdf":"00395273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059035S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1995","isNumber":"8965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"57","articleId":"395273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":395288,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Hoon Kim","id":"37366617200"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["Daewoo Institute for Advanced Engineering, Daewoo Telecom R and D Center, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37267508300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"395288","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":174,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2129},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Induction machines","Stators","Voltage","Inductance","Frequency","Industry Applications Society","Inverters","Production","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine control","machine theory","control system analysis","control system synthesis","optimal control","torque control","machine testing","electric current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction machine","field weakening region","maximum torque control","optimal current condition","flux level","current limit","voltage limit","simulation","experiment","induction motor drive","5 hp"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new approach to the induction machine control that ensures the production of maximum torque per ampere over the entire field weakening region is presented.

The paper describes variable frequency, variable voltage operation of a three-phase induction motor drive in single-phase mode for inverter fault conditions, such as open base drive and device short circuit. The detailed mathematical analysis of the machine in single-phase mode indicates that odd harmonic voltages of appropriate magnitude and phase can be injected at the machine terminal to neutralize the large low-frequency pulsating torques so as to permit smooth drive operation. The magnitude and phase angle of the desired harmonic voltages have been derived theoretically. However, to eliminate the parameter variation effect and operating point dependencies, a general purpose search algorithm has been proposed in the paper which fabricates the desired harmonic voltages on a real time basis. The search algorithm was initially exercised manually on a simulated drive system to prove its validity, and than tested extensively on a volts/hertz controlled 3-hp drive system in the laboratory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.395290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/8965/00395290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.395290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8965","startPage":"802","endPage":"811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line search based pulsating torque compensation of a fault mode single-phase variable frequency induction motor drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=395290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On-line search based pulsating torque compensation of a fault mode single-phase variable frequency induction motor drive","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5018541","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line search based pulsating torque compensation of a fault mode single-phase variable frequency induction motor drive","sourcePdf":"00395290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034697S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1995","isNumber":"8965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"34","articleId":"395290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":395296,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The developed sensorless synchronous motor drive starting function involves measurement of machine terminal voltage and current, from which the desired current command is then calculated and implemented by the drive power converter.

Reliability was demonstrated by the monotonically increasing success ratios with increasing training set size and by the small standard deviations from the mean success rates. An average success rate of 70 percent in diagnosing melanoma was attained for a training set size of 60 percent. The presence or absence of atypical moles in the training and test sets was shown to have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the generated classification rules. This was the case with both AIM and lst-Class, and indicates a high potential for success if a method can be found for discriminating between atypical moles and melanoma.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/8966/00395323.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/51.395323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.395323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=395323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of AI methods in detecting melanoma","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Malignant tumors","Decision trees","Spatial resolution","Pixel","Sun","Operating systems","Skin neoplasms","Induction generators","Computer languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skin","artificial intelligence","computer vision","medical image processing","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AI methods performance","melanoma detection","color skin tumor images","computer vision methods","benign tumors","monotonically increasing success ratios","training set size","mean success rates","atypical moles","AIM numeric modeling tool","lst-Class software","35 mm color slides","medical diagnostic imaging","35 mm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Performance of AI methods in detecting melanoma","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5023797","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of AI methods in detecting melanoma","sourcePdf":"00395323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055762S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1995","isNumber":"8966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"26","articleId":"395323","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":395400,"authors":[{"name":"D.-R.

We show that the HFN can emulate algorithms which are executable on the ring or the mesh-connected computer with the same time complexities in big-O notation. Moreover, the HFN can embed a folded hypercube having the same number of nodes with constant dilation. We compute the diameter, node connectivity, best container, /spl kappa/-wide diameter, and node-fault diameter of the HFN. We present optimal routing and broadcasting algorithms for the HFN.

After the presentation of previous work, a new concept of designing a digital FIR filter with a fixed order to suppress narrow-band disturbances is presented. The method is compared to a design using adaptive filters. A filter device, which was developed as an extension for a conventional PD detector, is presented. In the second part of the paper, a method for suppressing pulse shaped noise synchronous to the test voltage is discussed. The disturbing pulses are detected automatically in a PD signal by comparing several recorded cycles of the test voltage. There are two possibilities to suppress the pulses. The first one is an off-line method that allows attenuation degrees up to 30 dB, the second one works on line, and can process continuous PD signals. For the latter case a suppression of 14 dB for worst case pulses is possible with the developed hardware. In order to demonstrate the abilities of the filters, several measurements are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/94.395418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/8969/00395418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.395418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8969","startPage":"433","endPage":"446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rejection of narrow-band noise and repetitive pulses in on-site PD measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=395418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rejection of narrow-band noise and repetitive pulses in on-site PD measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5005890","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rejection of narrow-band noise and repetitive pulses in on-site PD measurements","sourcePdf":"00395418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036061S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"41","articleId":"395418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-24"},{"_id":395421,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Among the numerous fractal features that could be defined and used for an image surface, fractal dimension and lacunarity have been found to be useful for recognition purposes. Partial discharges (PD) occurring in all HV insulation systems is a very complex phenomenon, and more so are the shapes of the various 3-d patterns obtained during routine tests and measurements. It has been fairly well established that these pattern shapes and underlying defects causing PD have a 1:1 correspondence, and therefore methods to describe and quantify these pattern shapes must be explored, before recognition systems based on them could be developed. This contribution reports preliminary results of such a study, wherein the 3-d PD pattern surface was considered to be a fractal, and the computed fractal features (fractal dimension and lacunarity) were analyzed and found to possess fairly reasonable pattern discriminating abilities. This new approach appears promising, and further research is essential before any long-term predictions can be made.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5005887","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Can fractal features be used for recognizing 3-d partial discharge patterns","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can fractal features be used for recognizing 3-d partial discharge patterns","sourcePdf":"00395421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079676S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"8969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"107","articleId":"395421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":395461,"authors":[{"name":"B.B.

The EDGA combines the advantages of previous parallel GA models, viz., master/slave GA model and distributed GA model. In EDGA, the root processor executes the conventional genetic algorithm with global selection on total population and the remaining processors execute conventional genetic algorithm with local selection on subpopulations. After certain number of generations, the total population on the root processor and the subpopulations on the remaining processors are unchanged, and the process is repeated till terminating conditions are reached. This incorporates features of both global and local selection in the proposed EDGA. The EDGA is designed to obtain good speedup, global optimal solution, and full utilization of the parallel system. We have implemented master/slave GA, distributed GA, and the proposed EDGA in C on a transputer-based parallel MIMD machine and compared their performance. It is found that the EDGA achieves higher speedup than both master/slave GA, and distributed GA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1993.395461","pdfPath":"/iel2/3153/8971/00395461.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"733","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 5th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 5th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1993.395461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended distributed genetic algorithm for channel routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Extended distributed genetic algorithm for channel routing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4946047","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended distributed genetic algorithm for channel routing","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00395461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065345S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec 1993","isNumber":"8971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3153","citationCount":"7","articleId":"395461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":395481,"authors":[{"name":"Y.L.

By adding remote links to the diagonal directions of the torus network recursively, the RDT can realize a smaller diameter (e.g., it is 11 for 2/sup 16/ nodes) with smaller number of links per node (i.e., 8 links per node) than that of the hypercube. A simple routing algorithm called vector routing, which is near-optima and easy to implement is also proposed. The RDT comprises the mesh structure, and emulates hypercube and tree structures easily. FFT and the bitonic sorting algorithm are also easy to implement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 5th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3153/8971/00395481.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"594","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 5th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1993.395481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1993.395481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=395481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Diagonal Torus: an interconnection network for massively parallel computers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Computer networks","Concurrent computing","Hypercubes","Routing","Mesh networks","Tree data structures","Sorting","Communication networks","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor interconnection networks","parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Recursive Diagonal Torus","interconnection network","massively parallel computers","remote links","torus network","RDT","simple routing algorithm","vector routing","mesh structure","hypercube","tree structures","FFT","bitonic sorting algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Diagonal Torus: an interconnection network for massively parallel computers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4946027","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Diagonal Torus: an interconnection network for massively parallel computers","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00395481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028508S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec 1993","isNumber":"8971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3153","citationCount":"15","articleId":"395481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":395505,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The results of our experiments show that the parallelism in HMMs can be effectively exploited by the MP-1. Training that use to take nearly a week can now be completed in about an hour.

It uses the feedforward neural network with back-propagation (FN) as a building block. A single FN is used to classify all of the given patterns, then a confusion matrix is carefully studied and used to divide the patterns into groups. This process is repeated by training new FNs with these groups then dividing them into subgroups and so on, until no more grouping could be obtained. It is shown that by this approach, the available feature set can be used more effectively. The testing environment of this work is the isolated handwritten Arabic character set, which is a problem of reasonable complexity.

As a problem in machine reading and interpretation, it presents many challenges. A method for determining the delivery point codes (DPCs) for handwritten addresses by computer is described. Solution to the task requires locating and recognizing address components (e.g., ZIP Code, street number, P.O. box number) and using multiple information sources to assign the DPC to an address. The methodology uses diverse pattern recognition techniques, image processing algorithms (thresholding, underline removal, separation of lines, location and recognition of address components), and access to United States Postal Service (USPS) databases to determine the DPC.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395729","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR '93)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR '93)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3154/8972/00395729.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8972","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpretation of handwritten addresses in US mailstream","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=395729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interpretation of handwritten addresses in US mailstream","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395729/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4950937","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpretation of handwritten addresses in US mailstream","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"00395729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031249S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3154","citationCount":"22","articleId":"395729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":395737,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The model is a kind of multi-layer feedforward model. This model has three functional components. First is a recognition result generation according to a feedforward process in a multi-layer model. Another component calculates an uncertainty score from the output values. If the uncertainty score is greater than a threshold value, the last component, that is an inverse recall, operates. The inverse recall function produces changes in input values, in order to reduce the uncertainty score. The changes show input parts which are important for more certain recognition but are missed in the input pattern. The feedback method can adjust feature extraction parameters so as to detect the important features shown by the inverse recall network model. Then, features are extracted again by using the modified feature extraction parameter values. These feedforward and feedback processings are repeated until a certain recognition result is obtained. This method was examined for handwritten alpha-numeric recognition and it was found that a rejection ratio can be reduced at the same substitution error ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395737/","accessionNumber":"4950929","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Feedback pattern recognition by inverse recall neural network model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback pattern recognition by inverse recall neural network model","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"00395737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037251S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3154","articleId":"395737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":395738,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Ray tracing complex scenes can require large amounts of CPU time and memory storage. We present a parallel implementation of the ray tracing algorithm on the Intel Delta parallel computer.

In our database distribution, one part of the database is duplicated on each processor and the remaining part is evenly distributed among groups of processors.

Tiling is a well-known method for parallelization and for improving data locality. However, tiling has the potential of being even more beneficial. At the finest granularity, it can be used to guide register allocation and instruction scheduling; at the coarsest level, it can help manage magnetic storage media. It also can be useful in overlapping data movement with computation, for instance by prefetching data from archival storage, disks and main memory into cache and registers, or by choreographing data movement between processors. Hierarchical tiling is a framework for applying both known tiling methods and new techniques to an expanded set of uses. It eases the burden on several compiler phases that are traditionally treated separately, such as scalar replacement, register allocation, generation of message passing calls, and storage mapping. By explicitly naming and copying data, it takes control of the mapping of data to memory and of the movement of data between processing elements and up and down the memory hierarchy. This paper focuses on using hierarchical tiling to exploit superscalar pipelined processors. On a simple example, it improves performance by a factor of 3, achieving perfect use of the superscalar processor's pipeline. Hierarchical tiling is presented here as a method of hand-tuning performance; while outside the scope of this paper, the ideas can be incorporated into an automatic preprocessor or optimizing compiler.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3156/8974/00395939.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th International Parallel Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1995.395939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1995.395939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=395939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical tiling for improved superscalar performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Tiles","Computer science","Parallel processing","Zinc","Drives","Prefetching","Cache storage","Message passing","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message passing","parallel processing","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical tiling","superscalar performance","inner-loop performance","data locality","parallelization","register allocation","instruction scheduling","archival storage","compiler phases","scalar replacement","message passing","storage mapping","superscalar pipelined processors","automatic preprocessor","optimizing compiler"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical tiling for improved superscalar performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4962859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-28 April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical tiling for improved superscalar performance","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00395939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030897S","chronDate":"25-28 Apr 1995","isNumber":"8974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3156","citationCount":"24","articleId":"395939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":395947,"authors":[{"name":"I.

As opposed to the conventional list-scheduling approach, our technique works by first serializing the task graph and \"injecting\" all the tasks to one processor. The parallel tasks are then 'bubbled up' to other processors and are inserted at appropriate time slots. The edges among the tasks are also scheduled by treating communication links between the processors as resources. The proposed approach takes into account the link contention and underlying communication routing strategy, and can self-adjust on regular as well as arbitrary network topologies. To reduce the complexity, our scheduling algorithm is itself parallelized. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt in designing a parallel algorithm for scheduling. The proposed approach implemented on an iPSC/860 hypercube, while yielding a high speedup in its execution, performs considerably better under a wide range of parameters including the task graph size, communication-to-computation ratio, and the target system topology. Comparisons are made with two other approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1995.395947","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3156/8974/00395947.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1995.395947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8974","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th International Parallel Processing Symposium","startPage":"289","endPage":"293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"25-28 April 1995","displayDocTitle":"A parallel approach for multiprocessor scheduling","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4962866","publicationDate":"1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/395947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Apr 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel approach for multiprocessor scheduling","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00395947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054576S","chronDate":"25-28 Apr 1995","isNumber":"8974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3156","citationCount":"15","articleId":"395947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":395951,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Three main applications of an accurate locomotive computer model can be identified. First these models give engineers the ability to study the behaviour of complex equipment prior to the construction phase. Many design problems may be solved before the prototype stage resulting is large cost savings. Secondly for existing equipment a computer model is an invaluable diagnostic tool for technical staff to study the symptoms of various faults and thus expedite the rectification process. Thirdly a computer model can give unparalleled benefit in the technical training area. The actual operation of the system can be studied by personnel in an interactive manner. A total systems simulation of a Queensland Rail 3500 Class electric locomotive has been undertaken for which the 'SIMULINK' dynamic systems analysis package is utilised. This paper presents the techniques being applied to model the power conversion equipment, DC traction motors, mechanical drive train, wheel-rail interaction, control systems, traction transformer and supply systems. The model provides the user with the possibility to view macro effects such as control loop performance and power semiconductor stress levels interactively in the one simulation. Using this model the various control functions such as creep control and motor load sharing can be studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950207","publicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Electric Railways in a United Europe","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 International Conference on Electric Railways in a United Europe","pdfPath":"/iel3/3158/8976/00396031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19950207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8976","startPage":"202","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locomotive \"total systems\" simulation using SIMULINK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=396031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Locomotive \"total systems\" simulation using SIMULINK","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/396031/","conferenceDate":"27-30 March 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4940667","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locomotive \"total systems\" simulation using SIMULINK","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00396031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034639S","chronDate":"27-30 Mar 1995","isNumber":"8976","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3158","citationCount":"13","articleId":"396031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":396072,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The reality is a far cry from the apparent claims, but none the less, it is an emerging area where large global players are starting to flex their muscles as the potential business could be very large, and the impact on society irreversible. The first major service on such a \"super-highway\" may well be video on demand, a term that often includes not only movies and past TV programmes but also transactional services such as shopping, banking, education, training and games, all fully on-demand, and all initially aimed squarely at the mass residential market, delivered over telecommunications networks. To that end, during 1994, BT ran a technology trial of video on demand in Suffolk for 60 employee customers and is now moving towards launching a market trial of various interactive multimedia services for perhaps 2500 paying customers in 1995. The paper looks at the major technical aspects of BT's implementation of video on demand.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/396072/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4951682","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"26-29 March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"BT's video on demand technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BT's video on demand technology","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00396072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041304S","chronDate":"26-29 Mar 1995","isNumber":"8977","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3159","citationCount":"1","articleId":"396072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":396122,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We explain the concept, present the mathematical foundation, formulate the implementation, and discuss the verification aspects of the technique. We then present a further improvement over this new technique when we are concerned with only block codes. Finally, we present examples of using these new techniques to simulate the system error performance at the critical low error rate region of system operation.

Usually, the scattering parameters of each interface are computed independently for each incident space harmonic, and only a small number of these can be handled for the cascade process. This is not a limitation when thick substrates are used. but for thin dielectric layers a prohibitive number of harmonics must be used to obtain accurate results. In the present paper, an efficient and rigorous mode matching (MM) technique has been implemented for the analysis of multilayered rectangular FSS, that allows to use a high number of space harmonics in the cascade. The elementary structure considered as a building block, is a metallic screen with periodic rectangular apertures (inductive screen) or an array of rectangular patches (the complementary capacitive screen), placed on the interface between two different dielectrics. First, the whole GSM of a single screen, with a high number of space harmonics (several hundreds), is computed directly, assuming multiple harmonic incidence. Then, the GSMs are cascaded iteratively to analyse the multilayer structure. Numerical results are presented to show the importance of higher order space harmonics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1049/cp:19950368","publicationTitle":"1995 Ninth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation, ICAP '95 (Conf.

In contrast to AC distribution, the DC distribution used in telecommunications and its associated grounding are not extensively covered in electrical codes such as the National Electrical Code and the Canadian Electrical Code, or in international standards such as IEC 364. The paper identifies analogies and differences between the experience-based, codified requirements for single-phase DC systems and the evolving requirements for DC powering and system grounding used in telecommunications. It suggests that the harmonization efforts of evolving national, regional and global standards for these DC systems could benefit from a critical examination of the proven principles developed for AC distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/396619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct-3 Nov 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4939688","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 1994","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Three-wire DC distribution to telecommunication equipment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-wire DC distribution to telecommunication equipment","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00396619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030318S","chronDate":"30 Oct-3 Nov 1994","isNumber":"8982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3164","citationCount":"1","articleId":"396619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":396620,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The proposed converter exhibits soft-switching for no-load to full load conditions and maintains high overall efficiency.

The purpose of the systems has been to increase road traffic safety. Spread spectrum (SS) communication systems are able to communicate and range the distance between the terminals simultaneously. Thus it is advantageous to use the spread spectrum techniques for inter-vehicle communications. Considering the mobility of the terminals, the network need to be modeled as a number of terminals approaching each other randomly. So its operations and management should be done in a decentralized (i.e. base-station-less) manner. In this paper, medium access control (MAC) protocol for the inter-vehicle communication network using the spread spectrum technique is proposed, where a vehicle exchanges its data regularly with other surrounding vehicles. Computer simulations evaluates the basic performance of the protocol under highway conditions. It is shown that inter-vehicle communication can carried be smoothly carried out between one and surrounding vehicles in such environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC protocol for inter-vehicle communication network using spread spectrum technique","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of VNIS'94 - 1994 Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference","doi":"10.1109/VNIS.1994.396849","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of VNIS'94 - 1994 Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3166/8984/00396849.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNIS.1994.396849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=396849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/396849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"MAC protocol for inter-vehicle communication network using spread spectrum technique","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4939370","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC protocol for inter-vehicle communication network using spread spectrum technique","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00396849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051904S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3166","citationCount":"13","articleId":"396849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":396858,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.M.

Preventing drowsiness during driving requires a method for accurately detecting a decline in driver alertness and a method for alerting and refreshing the driver.

Diminished alertness is detected on the basis of the degree to which the driver's eyes are open or closed. This detection system provides a noncontact technique for judging various levels of driver alertness and facilitates early detection of a decline in alertness during driving.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VNIS.1994.396873","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of VNIS'94 - 1994 Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of VNIS'94 - 1994 Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3166/8984/00396873.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNIS.1994.396873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of drowsiness detection system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=396873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/396873/","displayDocTitle":"Development of drowsiness detection system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4939346","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of drowsiness detection system","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00396873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02105S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3166","citationCount":"83","articleId":"396873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":396922,"authors":[{"name":"Chu Kwong Chak","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Control, School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Chu Kwong Chak","id":"37087152665"},{"name":"Gang Feng","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Control, School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Gang Feng","id":"37087152770"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2404-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"396922","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy logic","Least squares approximation","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Parameter estimation","Automatic control","Humans","Neural network hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy logic","backpropagation","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network implementation","new fuzzy system","learning scheme","fuzzy logic system","membership functions","data pairs","back error propagation","least squares estimation","convergence","consequence parameters","backpropagation","premise parameters","high order fuzzy system","nonlinear function modelling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=396922","abstract":"The architecture and learning scheme of a new fuzzy logic system implemented in the framework of neural network is proposed.

After providing an overview of prior routing work, we define various QOS constraints. We present a call architecture that may be used for QOS matching and a connection management mechanism for network resource allocation.

These vocoders can produce intelligible speech at low data rates (800-2400 b/s), but they often sound synthetic and generate annoying artifacts such as buzzes, thumps, and tonal noises. These problems increase dramatically if acoustic background noise is present at the speech input. This paper presents a new mixed excitation LPC vocoder model that preserves the low bit rate of a fully parametric model but adds more free parameters to the excitation signal so that the synthesizer can mimic more characteristics of natural human speech. The new model also eliminates the traditional requirement for a binary voicing decision so that the vocoder performs well even in the presence of acoustic background noise. A 2400-b/s LPC vocoder based on this model has been developed and implemented in simulations and in a real-time system. Formal subjective testing of this coder confirms that it produces natural sounding speech even in a difficult noise environment. In fact, diagnostic acceptability measure (DAM) test scores show that the performance of the 2400-b/s mixed excitation LPC vocoder is close to that of the government standard 4800-b/s CELP coder.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mixed excitation LPC vocoder model for low bit rate speech coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.397089","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/8989/00397089.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.397089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"A mixed excitation LPC vocoder model for low bit rate speech coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5020825","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mixed excitation LPC vocoder model for low bit rate speech coding","sourcePdf":"00397089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030446S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"193","articleId":"397089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":397090,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The underlying principle is to decompose the vector space of the noisy signal into a signal-plus-noise subspace and a noise subspace. Enhancement is performed by removing the noise subspace and estimating the clean signal from the remaining signal subspace. The decomposition can theoretically be performed by applying the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) to the noisy signal. Linear estimation of the clean signal is performed using two perceptually meaningful estimation criteria. First, signal distortion is minimized while the residual noise energy is maintained below some given threshold. This criterion results in a Wiener filter with adjustable input noise level. Second, signal distortion is minimized for a fixed spectrum of the residual noise. This criterion enables masking of the residual noise by the speech signal. It results in a filter whose structure is similar to that obtained in the first case, except that now the gain function which modifies the KLT coefficients is solely dependent on the desired spectrum of the residual noise. The popular spectral subtraction speech enhancement approach is shown to be a particular case of the proposed approach. It is proven to be a signal subspace approach which is optimal in an asymptotic (large sample) linear minimum mean square error sense, assuming the signal and noise are stationary. Our listening tests indicate that 14 out of 16 listeners strongly preferred the proposed approach over the spectral subtraction approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","publicationDate":"July 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5020826","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A signal subspace approach for speech enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal subspace approach for speech enhancement","sourcePdf":"00397090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060865S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"8989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"607","articleId":"397090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":397091,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

Front ends were compared with a control mel filter bank (MFB) based cepstral front end in clean speech and with speech degraded by noise and spectral variability, using the TI-105 isolated word database. MFB recognition error rates ranged from 0.5 to 26.9% in noise, depending on the SNR, and auditory models provided error rates as much as four percentage points lower. With speech degraded by linear filtering, MFB error rates ranged from 0.5 to 3.1%, and the reduction in error rates provided by auditory models was less than 0.5 percentage points. Some earlier studies that demonstrated considerably more improvement with auditory models used linear predictive coding (LPC) based control front ends.

Most of the methods previously developed for mapping algorithms onto processor arrays assumed an unbounded array (i.e., one in which there will always be a sufficient number of processing elements (PEs) for the mapping). Implementing such an array is not practical. A more practical approach would be to assign the PEs to chips and map the given algorithm onto the new array of chips. The authors describe a way to directly map algorithms onto a multiple-chip data-driven array, where each chip contains a limited number of PEs. There are two optimization steps in the mapping. The first is to produce an efficient mapping by minimizing the area (i.e., the number of PEs used) as well as optimizing the performance (pipeline period and latency) for the given algorithm, or finding a trade-off between area and performance. The second is to divide the unbounded array among several chips each containing a bounded number of PEs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1993.397119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1993.397119","startPage":"41","endPage":"52","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASAP '93)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3169/8990/00397119.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASAP '93)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping algorithms onto a multiple-chip data-driven array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Mapping algorithms onto a multiple-chip data-driven array","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5043555","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397119/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping algorithms onto a multiple-chip data-driven array","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"00397119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029115S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3169","citationCount":"1","articleId":"397119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":397134,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This screen and format configurable design has potential applications in portable devices, wireless communication and head-mounted display for virtual reality systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1993.397145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1993.397145","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASAP '93)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASAP '93)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3169/8990/00397145.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power polygon renderer for computer graphics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Low-power polygon renderer for computer graphics","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5050104","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power polygon renderer for computer graphics","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"00397145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027256S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3169","citationCount":"3","articleId":"397145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":397157,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A systolically-flowing instruction accompanies each input vector propagating in the array. This avoids the need of emptying and refilling the array when the operating mode of the array is changed. Both the GENES-IV chip, containing a matrix of 2 /spl times/ 2 PEs, and an auxiliary arithmetic circuit have been manufactured and successfully tested.

A test algorithm for the popular ring-address SRAM-type FIFOs has been published [Go94]; it consists of 36 steps and has a test length of 2n/sup 2/+10n+12+2/spl middot/Del (where n is the number of cells in the FIFO, and Del a delay time), while not all coupling faults are detectable due to the addressing restrictions of the FIFO. This paper presents a new test algorithm based on BIST which consists of 25 steps, reduces the test length to 21n+13+2/spl middot/Del, and allows for full fault coverage. It has been implemented as part of a macro-cell generator for FIFOs at AT&T Microelectronics.

Simulation results are obtained using a previously developed circuit model of the defect experimentally validated. Depending on the transistor affected by a gate oxide short, different SRAM faulty behaviors, as coupling faults or dynamic faults, can occur. Merits of logic and current testing are considered, comparing the fault coverage and test cost of each methodology. Results show that current testing gives a higher fault coverage with a lower cost. Finally a modified SRAM architecture is proposed to enhance testability for current testable defects.

They introduce fading resistance and fading susceptance measures that are asymptotic performance characterizations capturing the ability or inability of detectors to withstand fading interference. It is found that the optimum single-user or conventional detection strategy, when employed over the CDMA Rician fading channel, is limited in performance by fading interference in a manner akin to specular or multiple-access interference. Even the multiuser detectors designed for the CDMA AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channel, which are known to be able to withstand specular interference, are found to be unable to combat fading interference. The detectors optimized for the Rician fading channel, the optimal faded detector, and the faded decorrelator are found, however, unlike the previous classes of detectors, to be resistant to such interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8992/00397244.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"141 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fading resistant multiuser detection over CDMA fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Rician channels","AWGN","Multiple access interference","Electrical resistance measurement","Additive white noise","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rician channels","fading","code division multiple access","radiofrequency interference","signal detection","Gaussian noise","white noise","memoryless systems","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA fading channels","detector performance","code division multiple access","fading resistance","fading susceptance","fading interference","Rician fading channel","multiuser detectors","AWGN","additive white Gaussian noise","optimal faded detector","faded decorrelator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fading resistant multiuser detection over CDMA fading channels","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4932827","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fading resistant multiuser detection over CDMA fading channels","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041607S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"1","articleId":"397244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":397246,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The LOROC encoding scheme is reviewed with emphasis on the multiple access interference (MAI) characterization of LOROC encoded multirate spread spectrum signals. The effect of interleaving is also addressed. A multiuser equalizer particularly suitable for a MAI rejecting mobile hand-portable has been put together with a LOROC decoder.

This technique is based on modeling the predistorter-modulator-HPA system as a neural network with memory. It is shown that, by extending the optimization algorithm of back-propagation to complex signals and with neurons modeled as finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters, the proposed algorithm determines automatically the predistorter with the objective that the overall transmitter behaves as a linear system with a prescribed pulse shape. The novelty with respect to previous techniques is that in the present scheme a control on the spectrum of the signal after the HPA is exercised.

Multiple transmissions are made for each spread signal. Each transmission is independently delayed and amplified in the complex domain according to the delay profile and the estimated path strength of the channel. This is done to facilitate reception of a signal at the mobile unit which is already a RAKE combination of the multipath signals. This method is called a pre-RAKE combination system because the RAKE combination function is performed pre-transmission. Using this method the size and complexity of the mobile unit can be kept to a minimum. The pre-RAKE method retains the advantages of diversity reception in a multi-path fading environment. An examination of the SNR for the traditional RAKE and the pre-RAKE systems and computer simulations show that the performance of the pre-RAKE system is equivalent to that of the RAKE system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397307","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8992/00397307.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"467 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-RAKE diversity combination for direct sequence spread spectrum communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397307/","displayDocTitle":"Pre-RAKE diversity combination for direct sequence spread spectrum communications systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4932890","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-RAKE diversity combination for direct sequence spread spectrum communications systems","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050151S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"64","articleId":"397307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":397308,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It is shown that the proposed AT acquisition scheme is robust for receiving packets with a large amplitude dynamic range. Compared with the conventional constant threshold acquisition scheme, the new scheme only needs a few more logic units and a small memory unit for its implementation.

The transmission method is based on generating nonuniformly pulsed PAM (pulse amplitude modulation) signals which at the network sampling instants go through one of the slicing levels of the A/D converter of the network. To accomplish this, both the slicing levels and the sampling clock times must be known. This is a hard practical problem and one can only conjecture if a reasonable solution will be possible.

If the length of the impulse response of the channel is not negligible compared to the permitted symbol length, the impulse response can be shortened by passing the received signal through a time-domain equalizer before modulation. The best performance for a given computational complexity can then be achieved by appending to each block of samples of the transmit signal a cyclic prefix that has the same length as the shortened impulse response. Several algorithms for designing the time-domain equalizer, which use adaptation in the frequency domain and windowing in the time domain in order to minimize the mean squared error of the equalized response, are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4932943","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Equalizer training algorithms for multicarrier modulation systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalizer training algorithms for multicarrier modulation systems","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098963S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"98","articleId":"397376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":397377,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The performance of the system, which depends strongly on the two parameters /spl alpha//sub 1/, /spl alpha//sub 2/ and on the codes is optimized.

It is shown that for different receiver conditions one can assume a graceful degradation by using such a combination and obtaining a coding gain at least of about 7.5 dB. This may used for enlarging the broadcasting area or to reduce the transmitter power.

Improvements of the standard coding system which can be separated in two groups are presented. The first group is composed of modifications concerning only the receiver, which can be used in current missions, such as the Galileo Mission, where every tenth of a decibel is needed. The second group comprises additional modifications on code parameters at the transmitter side and should be viewed as recommendations for future deep space missions. In the first group, additional coding gains of about 0.3 dB to 0.4 dB, and, in the second group, of about 0.6 dB to 0.9 dB can be achieved compared to the standard coding system.

In this context, a new approach called XOR strategy, based on the selective repeat strategy for capacity enhancement of a communication channel, is suggested. The idea of the XOR selective repeat strategy is to physically combine several blocks negatively acknowledged (NACKed) by different receivers by XORing (i.e., modulo 2 addition) to minimize the number of retransmissions and to increase throughput. Five different implementations of the XOR strategy and the pure selective repeat strategy are compared in terms of throughput. The XOR protocols differ in the applied algorithms for the XORing of NACKed data blocks. The analytical and simulative results show that, in terms of throughput, all five XOR strategies yield remarkably better results than the pure selective repeat.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397450","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8993/00397450.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397450","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"1113","endPage":"1117 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new efficient selective repeat protocol for point-to-multipoint communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new efficient selective repeat protocol for point-to-multipoint communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397450/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972516","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new efficient selective repeat protocol for point-to-multipoint communication","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044141S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"27","articleId":"397450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":397451,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The error probability of an uncoded OMPPM system is investigated in an optical direct-detection channel in the quantum limited case. Both capacity and cutoff rate are evaluated in this channel. Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are employed for OMPPM to achieve high energy information efficiency in the high throughput range. It is shown that OMPPM outperforms on-off keying (OOK), PPM, and MPPM in terms of both capacity and cutoff rate for the same bandwidth and the same probability of pulse occurrence. It is also shown that RS-coded OMPPM achieves high energy information efficiency, even in the range of high throughput.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8993/00397452.pdf","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1127 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlapping multi-pulse pulse position modulation in optical direct detection channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Overlapping multi-pulse pulse position modulation in optical direct detection channel","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4972518","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlapping multi-pulse pulse position modulation in optical direct detection channel","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025782S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"16","articleId":"397452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":397453,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The input signal is modeled as a finite state Markov process, and the fixed lag smoother equations for estimating this input sequence are derived. The unknown channel taps are simultaneously estimated, using an incomplete data version of the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, where the (unknown) regressed data error and covariance are replaced by their expectations conditioned on the observations. A sufficient condition for local convergence of the tap estimates is given in terms of a sufficiency of excitation condition of the input Markov chain. Sub-optimal algorithms of reduced computation requirement, which utilize reduced state estimation (via decision feedback), are specified. The performance of the algorithms is illustrated using simulations employing quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive blind equalisation of FIR channels using hidden Markov models","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397453","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8993/00397453.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1133 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive blind equalisation of FIR channels using hidden Markov models","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972519","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive blind equalisation of FIR channels using hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027908S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"13","articleId":"397453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":397457,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A hierarchical decomposition divides the overall task of equalizing a high-order QAM channel into much simpler sub-tasks. Each sub-task can be accomplished fast and reliably using a blind clustering algorithm derived originally for 4-QAM signals. The constant modulus algorithm (CMA) is used as a benchmark to assess this multi-stage blind equalizer. It is demonstrated that the new blind adaptive algorithm achieves much faster convergence. This multi-stage clustering equalizer only requires slightly more computations than the very simple CMA and, like the latter, its computational complexity does not increase as the levels of digital symbols increase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397457/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4972523","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-complexity multi-stage blind clustering equaliser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-complexity multi-stage blind clustering equaliser","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059131S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"10","articleId":"397457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":397459,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The authors present design criteria of an all-digital demodulator for rate-3/4 TC 16-QAM which attains a BER of 10/sup -5/ with a power savings of roughly 3.5 dB in a typical nonlinear channel, when compared to conventional uncoded 8-PSK. This figure includes all of the impairments produced by increased satellite amplifier output back off (OBO) and by the presence of the subsystems for symbol timing recovery, carrier phase estimation and automatic gain control. A key factor in achieving such a good performance is the compensation of the nonlinear distortion of the received signal constellation by means of a modified metrics computation in the Viterbi decoder. With the aid of this particular technique, it is possible to move the optimum operating point of the amplifier much closer to saturation than in the conventional case, without any need for on-board amplifier linearization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397577","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8994/00397577.pdf","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1727 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis-coded 16-QAM transmission over a nonlinear satellite channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397577/","displayDocTitle":"Trellis-coded 16-QAM transmission over a nonlinear satellite channel","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972627","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis-coded 16-QAM transmission over a nonlinear satellite channel","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025323S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","articleId":"397577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":397578,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Results show the promising performance of this technique, especially when channel parameters are slowly variant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8994/00397581.pdf","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1751 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous CDMA for satellite frequency-selective broadcasting channels: Performance and receiver structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","Code division multiplexing","Performance analysis","RAKE receivers","Multiaccess communication","Frequency conversion","Bit error rate","Fading","Multipath channels","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct broadcasting by satellite","code division multiple access","radiowave propagation","error statistics","multipath channels","radio receivers","delay circuits","equalisers","least mean squares methods","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA","satellite frequency-selective broadcasting channels","performance","synchronous code division multiple access","frequency-selective propagation conditions","bit error rate","receiver schemes","RAKE receiver","combining gain","tapped delay line","equalizer","minimum mean squared error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous CDMA for satellite frequency-selective broadcasting channels: Performance and receiver structures","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972631","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous CDMA for satellite frequency-selective broadcasting channels: Performance and receiver structures","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032819S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"9","articleId":"397581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":397582,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A simple timing and carrier recovery scheme for a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) approach is proposed. The algorithm uses the receiver decisions to eliminate the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) as well as to provide estimates for samples of the pulse response at the demodulator output. These estimates are then used to generate a sampling phase error signal that can be used in a single phase locked loop configuration to correct carrier frequency, as well as timing offsets in the QAM based system. The algorithm exploits the characteristics of both the system as well as the environment, and is simple enough to allow integration with all other receiver blocks on a single integrated circuit. Preliminary results for an ADSL system with blind equalization starting from an unequalized state are presented.

The relative performances of three such techniques for a fading channel, multi-user CDMA system are described. Personal communication network systems using suppression filters based on the transversal least mean square (LMS) and the lattice and transform domain algorithms are studied. Bit error rates are found by simulations for different suppression filters. The overlay signal is assumed to be narrowband binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and the performance of these systems is studied for varying BPSK carrier frequency offsets. Since both the lattice and LMS filters converge to the Wiener filter, their relative performance is also studied during the on/off transient of the interference. It is found that the LMS and recursive least square (RLS) perform similarly under stationary interference. The RLS is less susceptible to changes in the interference due to its faster convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/3171/8994/00397607.pdf","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1894 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC '93 - IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1993.397607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1993.397607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression for CDMA based PCN systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference suppression","Multiaccess communication","Personal communication networks","Least squares approximation","Wiener filter","Binary phase shift keying","Narrowband","Transversal filters","Lattices","Resonance light scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","personal communication networks","adaptive filters","interference suppression","fading","least mean squares methods","phase shift keying","lattice filters","recursive filters","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive interference suppression","lattice filters","CDMA based PCN systems","narrowband interference","code division multiple access","performances","fading channel","multi-user CDMA system","transversal least mean square","simulations","overlay signal","narrowband binary phase shift keying","carrier frequency offsets","LMS filters","Wiener filter","recursive least square","stationary interference","convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression for CDMA based PCN systems","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972657","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive interference suppression for CDMA based PCN systems","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00397607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050178S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1993","isNumber":"8994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3171","citationCount":"9","articleId":"397607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":397609,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Four existing training algorithms are reviewed under a parameter estimation framework, and the method of target state backpropagation previously proposed by the authors is extended. The new algorithm follows a different approach to the generation of error signals in embedded layers by backpropagating target or desired states rather than partial derivatives. The target states are used in conjunction with a linear Kalman based update algorithm, and transients associated with initial conditions are eliminated through a time-varying method of covariance modification. Comparisons of the five algorithms are made through a system identification problem, and the error convergence associated with each algorithm versus actual training time is presented. The results demonstrate an increased rate of convergence in comparison with backpropagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1993.397632","startPage":"582","endPage":"587","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3172/8995/00397632.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1993.397632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman based artificial neural network training algorithms for nonlinear system identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Artificial neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Convergence","Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Parameter estimation","Signal generators","System identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear systems","neural nets","identification","backpropagation","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","training algorithms","nonlinear system identification","parameter estimation","target state backpropagation","linear Kalman based update algorithm","error convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Kalman based artificial neural network training algorithms for nonlinear system identification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4955559","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman based artificial neural network training algorithms for nonlinear system identification","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00397632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058105S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug 1993","isNumber":"8995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3172","citationCount":"1","articleId":"397632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":397635,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The fitness function is referred to as fuzzy critic. The fuzzy critic evaluates plans as populations in the GA with respect to multiple factors. Depending on the goals of the tasks, human operators can easily determine inference rules in the fuzzy critic because of the fuzzy logic. The strategy determines a path for a mobile robot which moves from a starting point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles in a work space and picking up loads on the way.

The control of the PM-machine is accomplished without knowledge of the absolute rotor position and therefore the control methods are well suited to low dynamic applications. Both methods use only the information in the DC link current in the frequency converter. The current information is used to control the PM-machine and only a few calculations are necessary. In the first method the average DC-link current is minimized in a stationary operating point and the impressed stator voltage is adjusted until a minimum of power occurs. The second method controls the PM-machine depending on the contour of the DC-link current, which is dependent on the power factor. The stator voltage to the PM-machine is adjusted to obtain an optimum power factor and efficiency. A test system which contains a frequency converter, a DC-link current measuring system, a PM-machine and a DC-machine acting as load is implemented. Test results show that the two control algorithms control the impressed stator voltages to the PM-machine very close to the optimum operating point in an efficiency point of view. The efficiencies for both methods are measured and they show only a slight difference in the efficiencies for the two methods. The efficiencies are measured at different loads and different speeds, The maximum efficiency is found to be approximately 77% around nominal load and nominal speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4945896","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of two, energy optimizing techniques for PM-machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of two, energy optimizing techniques for PM-machines","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00397745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028196S","chronDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3173","citationCount":"9","articleId":"397745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":397752,"authors":[{"name":"V.G.

This absence of distinct harmonics results mainly in reduction of acoustic noise associated with the respective PWM switching, minimization of torque pulsations, etc. In this paper, an amplitude-modulation pulse-width-modulation strategy for three-phase voltage source inverters is proposed. Significant minimization of inverter switching points, due to the lowest possible ratio of the modulation interval over the inverter output period (1:3), makes the proposed strategy very attractive for medium power applications where, for instance, annoyance due to periodic PWM waveforms is of concern.

When Newton's algorithm is applied, it can be estimated that at each iteration, 2/spl times/N/sup 2/ trigonometric functions have to be evaluated, N being the number of unknown switching angles in the first quarter-period interval. This is very time-consuming when the equations are to be solved in real-time, even when a digital signal processor (DSP) is used. A new system of algebraic harmonic elimination equations, in which no trigonometric function appears explicitly, are derived in this paper. The time necessary for solving the equations using a DSP is thus reduced. For single-phase inverters, the local linear model, which is to be formulated at each iteration and then solved to provide a new iterative solution, is a special Vandermonde system. Since algorithms which are more efficient than Gauss elimination can be used to solve a linear Vandermonde system, total solution time can be further reduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/3173/8996/00397753.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"84 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1994.397753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1994.397753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=397753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsewidth modulation based on real-time solution of algebraic harmonic elimination equations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation","Nonlinear equations","Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Pulse inverters","Digital signal processors","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","power system harmonics","real-time systems","circuit analysis computing","digital simulation","nonlinear equations","Newton method","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM inverter","pulse patterns","low-order harmonics","algebraic harmonic elimination equations","nonlinear transcendental equations","Newton's algorithm","iteration","single-phase","unknown switching angles","quarter-period interval","digital signal processor","local linear model","linear Vandermonde system","solution time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Pulsewidth modulation based on real-time solution of algebraic harmonic elimination equations","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4945902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsewidth modulation based on real-time solution of algebraic harmonic elimination equations","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00397753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03801S","chronDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3173","citationCount":"41","articleId":"397753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":397757,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The circuit design of GTO power conversion systems is determined by the snubber circuits, which are necessary to release the GTOs from turn-on and turn-off switching losses and to keep the overvoltages to be caused by GTO switching low. However, the overvoltage snubber for the GTOs in a three-level inverter has not existed until now. In three-level inverter topology, the overvoltage across the inner GTOs can give rise to the larger blocking voltage than half that of the DC-link voltage, so that the power dissipation at turn off may be much larger than expected, and also switching failure of the GTOs may happen. This paper presents a circuit design for clamping the overvoltages across the GTOs in three-level GTO inverters. The proposed circuit has two roles as follows; one is to minimize the power dissipation in each GTO. It can be achieved by clamping the overvoltage to half that of the DC-link voltage as exactly as possible. The other is to get blocking voltage balancing between the inner GTOs and the outer GTOs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4945943","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A circuit design for clamping an overvoltage in three-level GTO inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A circuit design for clamping an overvoltage in three-level GTO inverters","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00397854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043555S","chronDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3173","citationCount":"9","articleId":"397854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":397880,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In the robot based on the joint space disturbance observer, equivalent mass matrix, which represents the virtual mass of the manipulator in operational space, is defined independently of the dynamics of the manipulator.

Gaze holding on an target object with the controlled cameras keeps the target's stereo disparity small, and simplifies the visual processing to locate the target for pursuit control. The novel feature of our tracking method is the disparity-based segmentation method of the target object. The method utilizes zero disparity filter and correlation to separate the target object with small disparity from distracting background. Furthermore, using correlation method to estimate stereo disparity makes it possible to fixate on a surface of the target object.

Superquadrics that is a parametric 3-D shape modeling function can represent various shapes by using a single equation with some parameters. In this study, the superquadrics parameters of 3-D shape are estimated from a 2-D shading image by using a genetic algorithm (GA), which is an optimizing technique based on mechanisms of natural selection. Ten parameters, which are five parameters of the superquadrics shape, three eular angle parameters, and two shift parameters, are coded as a string in the GA. The string is evaluated by the difference between the given 2-D shading image and the calculated shading image from the 3-D shape represented by the parameters. By applying the GA to the optimization of the evaluation value, the string having the minimum difference is sought.

The scheme has three levels: learning level, skill level and adaptation level. The learning level manipulates symbols to reason logically for control strategies. The skill level produces control references along with the control strategies and sensory information on environments. The adaptation level controls robots and machines while adapting to their environments which include uncertainties. For these levels and to connect them, artificial intelligence, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms are applied to the hierarchical control system while integrating and synthesizing themselves. To be intelligent, the hierarchical control system learns various experiences both in top-down manner and bottom-up manner. The hierarchical control scheme is effective for intelligent robotics and mechatronics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1994.397967","pdfPath":"/iel2/3173/8997/00397967.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1225 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1994.397967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy, neural network, and genetic algorithm based control system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy, neural network, and genetic algorithm based control system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4933776","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy, neural network, and genetic algorithm based control system","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00397967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052234S","chronDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3173","citationCount":"2","articleId":"397967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":397968,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

Centrifugal and Coriolis forces as well as the influence of gravitation and friction depend on the state variables of the system. In the presence of strong nonlinearities, linear PID controllers for the individual joint axis drives, usually employed in industrial applications, cannot provide satisfactory performance due to their inherent limitations. Model-based schemes have the disadvantage that they require accurate system models, which are difficult to obtain. The problem is solved by using multilayer feedforward neural networks, which do not rely on a system model. They are used as an addition to the existing linear individual joint control structure. The convergence of the system is proved using Lyapunov's stability theory.

The system allows the use of standard learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation, Madaline III, etc.) and generates the weights for a 128 analog neural network device called ETANN (Electrically Trainable Analog Neural Network). An ultra fast weight setting algorithm stores the internal coefficients into a real analog (not computer simulated) neural network. The trainer and programmer (NETMAP) system is able to cycle through steps of learning, weight setting and parallel processing runs, performing the so called \"chip-in-the-loop\" procedure. The NETMAP system integrates hardware and software to interface and take full advantage of ETANN parallel processing capabilities. Due to weight setting is a complex and computationally intensive process, a solution, based on an off-line mapping between weights and pulses of charge, is proposed to speed up the loading time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1994.397999","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1400 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1994.397999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8997","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/3173/8997/00397999.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog neural network development system with fast on line training capabilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/397999/","displayDocTitle":"Analog neural network development system with fast on line training capabilities","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4933808","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog neural network development system with fast on line training capabilities","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00397999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026377S","chronDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3173","citationCount":"4","articleId":"397999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":398001,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Chih Hsu","affiliation":["Department of E & E Engineering, Musashi Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Chin-Chih Hsu","id":"37087173369"},{"name":"S.

We choose a second order reference model as an ideal output, then adjust the proportional sensitivity by using fuzzy adaptive controller to make the plant's output follows the reference signal. We apply modified GAs for rules searching because that the rules set constructed by cut and try works unsatisfactory. In our study, we offer two types of fuzzy controllers (one is constructed with state error /spl epsi/ & change rate of error /spl Delta//spl epsi/ and the other is constructed with state error /spl epsi/ & plant output y/sub p/). The conclusions we get from simulation results are: (1) Modified GAs can find population with higher fitness values since it select better populations by multiple-point crossover and multiple-point mutation, (2) Fuzzy controller with /spl epsi/ and y/sub p/ shows higher performance indices than that with /spl epsi/& /spl Delta//spl epsi/ for the reason that the front controller can avoid using same rules for different time delay constants, and (3) System remains controllable when the time delay constants exceed the expected margin, it proves that our fuzzy controller contains the characteristic of robustness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1994.398001","startPage":"1407","endPage":"1412 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1994.398001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8997","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON'94 - 20th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/3173/8997/00398001.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced genetic algorithms applied in MRFACS for fuzzy rules set optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398001/","displayDocTitle":"Advanced genetic algorithms applied in MRFACS for fuzzy rules set optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4933810","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced genetic algorithms applied in MRFACS for fuzzy rules set optimization","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00398001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030456S","chronDate":"5-9 Sep 1994","isNumber":"8997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3173","articleId":"398001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":398051,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The skin and proximity effects which increase the ac resistance of the inductor winding are considered. The core losses are studied. Power losses of the inductor are modeled by means of a frequency dependent series resistance. Parasitic capacitances which affect the inductor high-frequency operation are also considered. The model is applicable to cores with and without an air gap. Calculated and measured inductor parameters such as equivalent series inductance (ESL), reactance, equivalent series resistance (ESR), impedance magnitude and phase, and quality factor are plotted as functions of the operating frequency and compared.

This method is simple, extremely useful and readily applicable to the empirical modeling of such complex plasma processes. In characterizing the SiO/sub 2/ films, it is found that the dominant film property is its impurity concentration. The impurity concentration dictates the refractive index and permittivity, two critical figures of merit when these films are used as interlayer dielectric and in optoelectronic applications. The most important parameters in determining the impurity concentration of the films are substrate temperature and pressure. Increasing the substrate temperature causes the impurity concentration to decrease. This drop in impurity concentration causes an increase in refractive index and a decrease in permittivity. Increasing pressure has almost the same effect, causing a decrease in permittivity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEMT.1993.398164","startPage":"458","endPage":"463","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th IEEE/CHMT International Electronic Manufacturing Technology Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMT.1993.398164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8999","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th IEEE/CHMT International Electronic Manufacturing Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3174/8999/00398164.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based modeling of the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398164/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based modeling of the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4938865","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based modeling of the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00398164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046697S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3174","citationCount":"2","articleId":"398164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":398165,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

The experiments carried out on different surface mount technology (SMT) device types prove the capability of neural-network-based approaches to correctly segment objects (solder joints etc.), and to detect defects (solder voids etc.).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEMT.1993.398228","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th IEEE/CHMT International Electronic Manufacturing Technology Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMT.1993.398228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8999","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th IEEE/CHMT International Electronic Manufacturing Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3174/8999/00398228.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving X-ray inspection of printed circuit boards by integration of neural network classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398228/","displayDocTitle":"Improving X-ray inspection of printed circuit boards by integration of neural network classifiers","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4938801","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving X-ray inspection of printed circuit boards by integration of neural network classifiers","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00398228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064093S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct 1993","isNumber":"8999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3174","citationCount":"12","articleId":"398228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":398272,"authors":[{"name":"Y.F.

We have shown that a single neural network can correct an oscillator's output frequency while several environmental sources of frequency shift act on the oscillator. The advantage that a neural network offers over microprocessor controlled oscillators or Kalman filter control techniques is that a neural network does not need an a priori model of the physical system to arrive at the correct control algorithm. The results of this demonstration indicate that a neural network can have beneficial applications in a variety of frequency standard devices. We believe that the neural controller will work best as a control system supervisor, rather than as the main controller of the frequency standard system. Specifically, the neural network would learn the non-linear effects associated with the several servos that control the main physical parameters of a frequency standard (temperature, magnetic field, etc.), and correct the oscillator's frequency based on the state of these servos and any additional sensed environmental parameters. The dominant remaining technical issue is the training of the neural network. During this demonstration program, maintaining a stable, reproducible environment that could be varied quickly and randomly over the whole training parameter space proved to be a significant technological challenge. Future efforts will focus on methods to more efficiently train the neural networks and the identification of specific devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398275/","accessionNumber":"4946109","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Operation of a neural network controlled crystal oscillator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of a neural network controlled crystal oscillator","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00398275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094068S","chronDate":"1-3 Jun 1994","isNumber":"9000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3175","citationCount":"2","articleId":"398275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":398280,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

Two resonators have been constructed for oscillator development. One resonator is a room temperature thermoelectric (TE) stabilized sapphire resonator operating at 9.00000 GHz and configured as a two port device with an unloaded Q factor of 187000 and port couplings of 0.74 and 0.17. The second resonator is a liquid nitrogen cooled sapphire resonator with two stale temperature control operating at 8.95 GHz with an unloaded Q factor of about 40 million. The single sideband phase noise of a free running loop oscillator incorporating the room temperature resonator has been measured to be -104 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz with a f/sup -3/ dependence and is limited by the resonator Q and the flicker noise of the active components. By incorporating specially designed feedback electronics we have measured a reduced single sideband phase noise of -125 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz with a f/sup -3/ dependence. For this oscillator configuration the phase noise was limited by the flicker noise of the phase detector in the feed back electronics. Based on the room temperature results we predict that we will obtain better than -155 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz with the liquid nitrogen cooled resonator-oscillator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 48th Annual Symposium on Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3175/9000/00398301.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 48th Annual Symposium on Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.1994.398301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.1994.398301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low noise microwave oscillators based on high-Q temperature stabilized sapphire resonators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave oscillators","Temperature","Phase noise","Microwave devices","Q factor","Nitrogen","Noise measurement","Phase measurement","1f noise","Thermoelectricity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave oscillators","crystal oscillators","sapphire","temperature control","phase noise","feedback oscillators","flicker noise","cooling","thermoelectric devices","electric noise measurement","electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-Q temperature stabilized sapphire resonators","X-band microwave oscillators","thermoelectric stabilized sapphire resonator","liquid nitrogen cooled sapphire resonator","temperature control","single sideband phase noise","feedback electronics","flicker noise","phase detector","feed back electronics","9 GHz","8.95 GHz","1 kHz","Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Low noise microwave oscillators based on high-Q temperature stabilized sapphire resonators","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4928441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low noise microwave oscillators based on high-Q temperature stabilized sapphire resonators","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00398301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066175S","chronDate":"1-3 Jun 1994","isNumber":"9000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3175","citationCount":"15","articleId":"398301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":398344,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Moreover emphasis is given to the importance of fusing data acquired by sensors operating in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Neural networks (NNs) are employed to perform fusion of TM data with SAR data in order to obtain a landcover classification of an agricultural area in the surroundings of Florence (Italy). Two different architectures of NN are presented and employed, the counterpropagation network and the Kohonen map; the results obtained in both cases are reported and discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MFI.1994.398379","startPage":"756","endPage":"762","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on MFI '94.

This paper describes a PC-based feature selection system that solves this problem. The system uses a real-time fuzzy neural network. By using the numerical data about the membership functions and by testing thousands of feature subset combinations, the system searches for a subset that increases the separation between classes. If such a subset exists, its use makes it easier to identify the classes. The use of fewer features also results in smaller array sizes and a faster operation. The results of applying this technique to two different systems are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MFI.1994.398398","startPage":"607","endPage":"614","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on MFI '94.

The authors start by recognizing the fact that signal interpretation is attributed much to a human expert's domain-specific, pattern-perceiving capability of grasping raw signals by structured representations having multiple levels of abstraction. First, they attempt to organize such structured representations by using the hierarchical clustering method of data analysis. Then, based on these representations they formulate a human expert's interpretation skills as an activity of searching for an optimum combination of those perceptual units within that structured representation space being constrained by the situational data. In order to implement this activity, they introduce a genetic algorithm and apply it to the structured representation space assimilating a human analyst's creative interpreting task of flexibly shifting the focal view of attention from the coarse to the precise. They implement a working system for signal understanding of the remote sensing data of seismic prospecting.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MFI.1994.398427","startPage":"395","endPage":"402","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on MFI '94.

The approach is based on the discrete scattering model used in the tissue characterization literature and the observation that most biological tissues are semi-regular scattering lattices. It has been demonstrated by many researchers and verified by the authors that the spectrum of the backscattered radio frequency (RF) signal collected with a diagnostic ultrasound transducer from a semi-regular tissue sample exhibits harmonically related resonances at frequencies determined by the average spacing between scatterers along a segment of the A-line. It is shown theoretically and demonstrated experimentally (for phantom, in vitro, and in vivo media) that these resonances change with changes in the tissue temperature within the processing window. In fact, changes in the resonances (/spl Delta/f) are linearly proportional to changes in the temperature (/spl Delta/T), with the proportionality constant being determined by changes in the speed of sound with temperature and the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the tissue. Autoregressive (AR) model-based methods aid in the estimation of /spl Delta/f. It should be emphasized that this new technique is not a time of flight velocimetric one, so it represents a departure from previously used ultrasonic methods for tissue temperature estimation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.398644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.398644","startPage":"828","endPage":"839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/9005/00398644.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noninvasive estimation of tissue temperature response to heating fields using diagnostic ultrasound","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Noninvasive estimation of tissue temperature response to heating fields using diagnostic ultrasound","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5053479","pubMedId":"7642197","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398644/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noninvasive estimation of tissue temperature response to heating fields using diagnostic ultrasound","sourcePdf":"00398644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035916S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"300","articleId":"398644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":398651,"authors":[{"name":"S.

When the channel is biased in inversion, the drain junction is forward biased and carriers from the AC signal source are readily injected into the channel, leading to charge exchange between the inversion carriers and the traps located in one half of the band gap. In channel depletion, the drain junction is reverse biased, and charge exchange is between the substrate majority carriers and traps located in the other half of the band gap. The charge interaction manifests itself in a differential gate capacitance, extracted from pre- and post-stress gate capacitance voltage curves. The differential capacitance spectrum shows two distinct peaks, which are attributed to the response of donor and acceptor interface traps, located on either half of the band gap. This model is supported by capacitance measurements at different frequencies. Lower frequencies lead to a proportionally larger increase in the depletion regime response. Prolonged stress results in the convolution of the two peaks. A reverse bias on the drain leads to the deconvolution of the spectrum, allowing the two peaks to be clearly resolved. Trap response may be masked by the fixed charge, but this can be overcome by depopulation of trapped electrons or neutralization of trapped holes through elevated temperature anneal. The differential gate-to-drain capacitance allows the electrical identification of both donor and acceptor interface traps in the same device.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.398669","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/9006/00398669.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.398669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of measurement frequency and temperature anneal on differential gate capacitance spectra observed in hot carrier stressed MOSFET's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Capacitance measurement","Frequency measurement","Stress measurement","Annealing","Hot carriers","Electron traps","Photonic band gap","AC generators","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","capacitance","electron traps","hole traps","annealing","interface states","equivalent circuits","hot carriers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement frequency","elevated temperature anneal","differential gate capacitance spectra","hot carrier stressed MOSFET","fixed traps","interface traps","gate-to-drain capacitance","MOS transistor","inversion carriers","substrate majority carriers","Si-SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Effects of measurement frequency and temperature anneal on differential gate capacitance spectra observed in hot carrier stressed MOSFET's","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2006","accessionNumber":"5018450","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of measurement frequency and temperature anneal on differential gate capacitance spectra observed in hot carrier stressed MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00398669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038717S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"15","articleId":"398669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":398671,"authors":[{"name":"Guobiao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Guobiao Zhang","id":"37087999489"},{"name":"Chenming Hu","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chenming Hu","id":"37087074328"},{"name":"P.Y.

It is based on previous work on efficient O(N) algorithms, where N is the number of links in the manipulator, and has been extended to include the effects of a mobile base (the URV body). In addition, the various hydrodynamic forces exerted on these systems in underwater environments are also incorporated into the simulation. The effects modeled in this work are added mass, viscous drag, fluid acceleration, and buoyancy forces. With efficient implementation of the resulting algorithm, the amount of computation with inclusion of the hydrodynamics is almost double that of the original algorithm for a six degree-of-freedom land-based manipulator with a mobile base. Nevertheless, the amount of computation still only grows linearly with the number of degrees of freedom in the manipulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.398681","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/9007/00398681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.398681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient dynamic simulation of an underwater vehicle with a robotic manipulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle dynamics","Underwater vehicles","Manipulator dynamics","Hydrodynamics","Heuristic algorithms","Robots","Computational modeling","Drag","Acceleration","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","robot dynamics","marine systems","hydrodynamics","manipulator dynamics","manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic simulation","robotic manipulator","underwater robotic vehicle","mobile base","hydrodynamic forces","underwater environments","added mass","viscous drag","fluid acceleration","buoyancy forces"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient dynamic simulation of an underwater vehicle with a robotic manipulator","volume":"25","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5013103","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398681/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient dynamic simulation of an underwater vehicle with a robotic manipulator","sourcePdf":"00398681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044142S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"110","articleId":"398681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":398682,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The inherent matching problems associated with the spurious features produced by overlapping among targets, the periodic structure of objects and the occlusion features were solved. The projection location constraint can be achieved by the deviation-to-distance transformation and the optimal epipolar constraint. The deviation-to-distance transformation transforms the location deviation of the extracted feature on an image plane to a maximum distance between the potential corresponding features and the epipolar line on another image for restricting the searching area of correspondences. The optimal epipolar constraint is obtained by adjusting the camera model before systems start to work. With the deviation-to-distance transformation and the optimal epipolar constraint, the arbitral area for searching the potential corresponding features can be made reasonably small. This not only saves computational time but also results in fewer ambiguous correspondences. In practice, the importance of the paper is that it proposes a very easy adjustment of camera geometry to simplify the most troublesome matching problem encountered in stereo systems. All the discussions and derivations are based on the geometry of the camera model and the mapping between the locations of the 3D features and their projection locations on the image planes. The non-ambiguity probability of the trinocular system is derived theoretically and verified by experimental results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/9007/00398682.pdf","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/21.398682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.398682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The optimal camera geometry and performance analysis of a trinocular vision system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Performance analysis","Machine vision","Information geometry","Stereo vision","Solid modeling","Robot vision systems","Senior members","Periodic structures","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","stereo image processing","image matching","feature extraction","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","trinocular vision system","projection location constraint","ambiguous correspondences","deviation-to-distance transformation","optimal epipolar constraint","location deviation","camera geometry","matching problem","stereo systems","3D features","nonambiguity probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"The optimal camera geometry and performance analysis of a trinocular vision system","volume":"25","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5013104","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The optimal camera geometry and performance analysis of a trinocular vision system","sourcePdf":"00398682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053698S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"5","articleId":"398682","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":398717,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Computer simulations using the maximum likelihood estimator provide a validation of the analytical results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.398717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9009/00398717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.398717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9009","startPage":"1557","endPage":"1567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction finding using noise covariance modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direction finding using noise covariance modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5037078","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction finding using noise covariance modeling","sourcePdf":"00398717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108309S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"74","articleId":"398717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":398719,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The structures obtained using the proposed technique have the perfect reconstruction property. Furthermore, all filters that constitute the subband coder are linear-phase FIR-type filters. In contrast with conventional design techniques that attempt to find a unitary alias-component matrix in the frequency domain, we carry out the design in the time domain, based on time-domain orthonormality constraints that the filters must satisfy. The M-band design problem is reduced to the problem of finding a suitable lowpass filter h/sub 0/(n). Once a suitable lowpass filter is found, the remaining (M-1) filters of the coder are obtained through the use of shuffling operators on the lowpass filter. This approach leads to a set of filters that use the same numerical coefficient values in different shift positions, allowing very efficient numerical implementation of the subband coder. In addition, by imposing further constraints on the lowpass branch impulse response h/sub 0/(n), we are able to construct continuous bases of M-channel wavelets with good regularity properties. Design examples are presented for four-, eight-, and 16-band coders, along with examples of continuous wavelet bases that they generate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.398719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9009/00398719.pdf","startPage":"1579","endPage":"1590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.398719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of efficient M-band coders with linear-phase and perfect-reconstruction properties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398719/","displayDocTitle":"Design of efficient M-band coders with linear-phase and perfect-reconstruction properties","volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5037080","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of efficient M-band coders with linear-phase and perfect-reconstruction properties","sourcePdf":"00398719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054885S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","articleId":"398719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":398720,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

In this paper, we present a unified theory of rank shaping for solving overdetermined and underdetermined versions of these problems. We develop several data-dependent rank-shaping methods and evaluate their performance. Our key result is a data-adaptive Wiener filter that automatically adjusts its gains to accommodate realizations that are a priori unlikely. The adaptive filter dramatically outperforms the Wiener filter on a typical realizations and just slightly under-performs it on typical realizations.

If noises in the auxiliary canceller channels are correlated with the noise in a main channel, then improvement in output signal-to-noise (S/N) power ratio is possible by cancelling in linear fashion the correlated auxiliary canceller channels with the main channel. The convergence performance of the polyspectral canceller is analyzed. A simple expression is derived for the asymptotic S/N efficiency of the adaptive polyspectral canceller as a function of the number of independent input sample vectors used to calculate the adaptive canceller weights and other canceller/noise model parameters. It is shown by simulation for low-order polyspectral cancellers of a specific form with Gaussian inputs that this asymptotic expression is a good approximation of the actual S/N efficiency for a moderate number of input sample vectors. However, for moderate-to-high order polyspectral cancellers, the asymptotic expression is a poor indicator of performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Signal to noise ratio","Convergence","Degradation","Random variables","Performance analysis","Vectors","Nonlinear systems","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","spectral analysis","interference suppression","signal sampling","matrix inversion","telecommunication channels","convergence of numerical methods","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic S/N results","adaptive polyspectral canceller","sample matrix inversion","auxiliary canceller channels","auxiliary sensor channels","output signal-to-noise power ratio","correlated auxiliary canceller channels","convergence performance","input sample vectors","adaptive canceller weights","canceller/noise model parameters","simulation","Gaussian inputs","S/N efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.398722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9009/00398722.pdf","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.398722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic S/N results for an adaptive polyspectral canceller using sample matrix inversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic S/N results for an adaptive polyspectral canceller using sample matrix inversion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398722/","volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5037083","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic S/N results for an adaptive polyspectral canceller using sample matrix inversion","sourcePdf":"00398722.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02998S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","articleId":"398722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":398723,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In particular, it presents necessary and sufficient conditions for strong consistency of the sample cumulants of arbitrary orders, and derives expressions for the asymptotic covariance of the sample estimates of the fourth-order cumulants. It is shown that the fourth-order cumulant C/sub 4y/ (/spl tau//sub 1/,...,/spl tau//sub 4/) can be written as a function of a single argument /spl tau/=/spl tau//sub 3/+/spl tau//sub 4/-/spl tau//sub 1/-/spl tau//sub 2/, which implies large flexibility in estimating the cumulant. It is recommended that the estimate be based upon lags such that /spl tau//sub 1/ is distant from /spl tau//sub 2/ and /spl tau//sub 3/ is distant from /spl tau//sub 4/, and/or as a linear combination of such terms. The asymptotic variance of a cumulant-based frequency estimator is shown to have the form c/sub 2//spl middot/SNR/sup -2/+c/sub 3//spl middot/SNR/sup -3/+c/sub 4//spl middot/SNR/sup -4/, where the coefficient c/sub 2/ may possibly vanish. The theory is illustrated via numerical examples. The results of this paper will be useful in analyzing the performance of various cumulant-based frequency estimation algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5037084","volume":"43","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical characterization of sample fourth-order cumulants of a noisy complex sinusoidal process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical characterization of sample fourth-order cumulants of a noisy complex sinusoidal process","sourcePdf":"00398723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042941S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","articleId":"398723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":398725,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The method is based on the property of cyclostationary signals to generate spectral lines when they pass through certain nonlinear transformations. The beamformer coefficients are selected according to a new optimization objective, which consists on minimizing the mean square error between the array output after the nonlinearity and a complex exponential. This approach optimally extracts any signal that generates a spectral line at the same frequency as the reference complex exponential. A gradient-based algorithm is derived to compute the optimum weights. Since the proposed cost function is a nonconvex function of the array coefficients, minima are analyzed for the three most common types of perturbations found in communications: Gaussian noise, multiple interferences, and multipath propagation. It is demonstrated via analysis and simulations that minima correspond to points where output noise power is minimized, interferences are canceled, and intersymbol interference is removed, i.e., the beamformer eliminates the distortion introduced by the radiocommunication channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.398725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9009/00398725.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.398725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive beamforming technique based on cyclostationary signal properties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=398725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive beamforming technique based on cyclostationary signal properties","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398725/","volume":"43","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5037086","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive beamforming technique based on cyclostationary signal properties","sourcePdf":"00398725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033221S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","articleId":"398725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":398733,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongde Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhongde Wang","id":"37350218200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"398733","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete transforms","Equations","Cyclic redundancy check","Discrete wavelet transforms","Strontium","Fourier transforms","Signal processing","Programming","Computer errors","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hartley transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized discrete Hartley transform","transforms","convolution"]}],"abstract":"The author comments on the paper by Hu et al.

One important issue in reliability synthesis is to find failure rates and repair rates of units, given the desired reliability requirement. Compensation of failures can be very significant for fail-fast TMR systems. This paper presents a new model of TMR systems in which fail-fast rates and compensating failures are considered, and employs a forward neural network to compute the failure rates and repair rates that meet the desired reliability requirement and the preassumed fail-fast rates. The failure rates and repair rates are obtained after the neural network becomes stable. Simulation results show that the model presented in this paper can allow higher failure rates of units to achieve the same reliability than the classical model. So we can design a redundant digital system with a much lower cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ATS.1993.398777","startPage":"44","endPage":"48","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE 2nd Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3179/9011/00398777.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE 2nd Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.1993.398777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network realization of Markov model of TMR systems with compensating failures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Costs","Computer networks","Redundancy","Computational modeling","Fault tolerant systems","Laboratories","Network synthesis","Digital systems","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","Markov processes","failure analysis","digital simulation","redundancy","reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triple modular redundancy","Markov model","TMR","compensating failures","reliability analysis","reliability estimation","reliability synthesis","failure rates","repair rates","forward neural network","fail-fast rates","redundant digital system","cost"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Neural network realization of Markov model of TMR systems with compensating failures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4991811","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network realization of Markov model of TMR systems with compensating failures","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00398777.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045131S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov 1993","isNumber":"9011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3179","articleId":"398777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":398799,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

The technique band-limits the continuous object before sampling it at the desired 3-D raster resolution. By precomputing tables of filter values for different types and sizes of geometric objects, the algorithm is very efficient and has a complexity that is linear with the number of voxels generated. The algorithm not only creates voxel models which are free from object space aliasing, but it also incorporates the image space antialiasing information as part of the view independent voxel model. The resulting alias-free voxel models have been used to model synthetic scenes, for discrete ray tracing applications. The discrete ray-traced image is superior in quality to the image generated with a conventional surface-based ray tracer, since silhouettes of objects, shadows, and reflections appear smooth (jaggy-less). In addition, the alias-free models are also suitable for intermixing with sampled datasets, since they can be treated uniformly as one common data representation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398854","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/3180/9012/00398854.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"84","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1993.398854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volume sampled voxelization of geometric primitives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Volume sampled voxelization of geometric primitives","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 Oct. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5050630","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/398854/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volume sampled voxelization of geometric primitives","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00398854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040942S","chronDate":"25-29 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3180","citationCount":"36","articleId":"398854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":398863,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While the SAR mode of the ERS-1 Active Microwave Instrument (AMI) can provide only limited temporal and spatial coverage, the scatterometer mode provides frequent, global coverage, albeit at a much lower (50 km) resolution. By applying a recently developed algorithm for generating enhanced resolution scatterometer images, the ERS-1 scatterometer data can be used to study both sea ice and glacial ice to support SAR-based studies. This paper describes the algorithm and its application to ERS-1 scatterometer data with particular emphasis on sea ice.

Recent studies have demonstrated that neural networks can be effective when used as a classifier of remote sensing data. One problem encountered using neural networks, though, is the time required to train the networks. This amount of time is directly related to the size of the network as well as to the amount of data used during the training. Earlier work demonstrated that a fast learning (FL) training algorithm provided a means to efficiently train neural networks in a fraction of the time required using conventional back-propagation learning algorithms. Additional decreases in the training time can be achieved by minimizing the network topology and analyses of the information content of the data. In this study, a fast learning (FL) neural network (NN) with optimized topology is applied to the problem of classification. Recently, new methods have been devised to determine the optimal size of the network required for a given set of data. The classification of remote sensing data using NNs trained with the FL and topology selection methods is examined. Several different SAR scenes are used to illustrate the technique. It is shown that the methods used are effective at classifying different land types while, at the same time, minimizing the size of the required networks and the time required for training the networks. The minimization of topology size, in addition to reducing training times, also reduces the amount of time for processing additional data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399454","pdfPath":"/iel2/3183/9017/00399454.pdf","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1412 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of remote sensing data using fast learning neural networks and topology selection algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Classification of remote sensing data using fast learning neural networks and topology selection algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5016444","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of remote sensing data using fast learning neural networks and topology selection algorithms","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00399454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065957S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","isNumber":"9017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3183","citationCount":"2","articleId":"399454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":399487,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.A.

The primary purpose of GlobeSAR is to strengthen the capability of the participating countries to use radar data in resource management applications, and to prepare for the use of data from the Canadian Radarsat satellite which will be launched in 1995. This program will continue for four years beginning with a training and data acquisition segment, followed by analysis of the airborne SAR and simulated Radarsat products, culminating in the analysis of the actual Radarsat data when these become available in 1995. An important aspect of the program is the close cooperation that will be established between the personnel in Canada and the host countries. GlobeSAR builds on the success of the Tropical Forestry Initiative (TFI) in Latin America, which was carried our recently by CCRS in cooperation with the European Space Agency. Through TFI, CCRS collected airborne radar data over some 15 tropically-forested sites in Brazil, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Guyana. With the TFI experience in mind, preliminary planning for a comprehensive global airborne radar program began.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399487","pdfPath":"/iel2/3183/9017/00399487.pdf","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1524 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Canadian GlobeSAR program","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"The Canadian GlobeSAR program","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5016477","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Canadian GlobeSAR program","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00399487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026437S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","isNumber":"9017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3183","citationCount":"11","articleId":"399487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":399598,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this work the unsupervised LPN module has been introduced to speed up the training phase of the MPL module. The performance of the MLP classifier trained, respectively, with the original uncompressed data and with the data preprocessed by the LPN module have been compared in terms of classification accuracy and computation time. The experimental results prove that even though the overall classification accuracy is comparable in both the experiments, the convergence time spent in the MLP training with the compressed data has been significantly reduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399598","startPage":"1873","endPage":"1876 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9018","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3183/9018/00399598.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multispectral classification by a modular neural network architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399598/","displayDocTitle":"Multispectral classification by a modular neural network architecture","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5027563","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multispectral classification by a modular neural network architecture","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00399598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043272S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","isNumber":"9018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3183","citationCount":"6","articleId":"399598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":399601,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Both methods are based on the evaluation of acceleration data measured by an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). The motion compensation algorithms were developed for the Experimental SAR System (E-SAR) of DLR which operates in L/C/X-Band. It is installed in a small Dornier Do-228 turboprop aircraft. Due to atmospheric turbulences and instabilities of the aircraft a highly accurate motion compensation becomes necessary to obtain high quality SAR images. The first method is furthermore based on results obtained by the Reflectivity Displacement Method (RDM). The RDM was developed by DLR and evaluates the radar raw data of the SAR sensor. The RDM provides a very accurate estimate of the forward velocity of the sensor which usually cannot be calculated by an inertial system with the required accuracy. Bias and drift components of the inertial data are eliminated by filtering. Residual systematic position errors are negligible for most applications and a high resolution SAR image can be generated. The advantages of this signal processing method are its robustness and its autonomy. The second method is based on the combination of inertial data and GPS position data. The GPS measurements are used to compensate the bias and drift components of the inertial data. Thus the actual position of the sensor can be estimated very accurately which guarantees a geometrically consistent high resolution SAR image. This signal processing method combines the absolute accuracy of GPS position measurements respectively its long term stability with the high bandwidth and data rate of the inertial measurements. In practice this method also turned out to be very robust.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399626","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3183/9018/00399626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9018","startPage":"1971","endPage":"1973 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensation for airborne SAR based on inertial data, RDM and GPS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=399626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensation for airborne SAR based on inertial data, RDM and GPS","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399626/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5038974","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensation for airborne SAR based on inertial data, RDM and GPS","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00399626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024456S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","isNumber":"9018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3183","citationCount":"19","articleId":"399626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":399653,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

In the multilook polarimetric filter, the joint distribution of the elements of the sample covariance matrix of the speckle vector is assumed to be a complex Wishart distribution. The Wishart pdf parameters are the look number L and six complex degrees of coherence. The filter output is a despeckled polarimetric feature vector from which a despeckled covariance matrix or Stokes operator matrix can be computed. For usual detected intensity images, the underlying radar reflectivity and the speckle intensity are assumed to be each a spatially correlated random variable. The input vector is an N dimensional vector whose components are the values of N pixels.

It is characterized by three real-valued parameters; one of these parameters, the number of looks, is related to the kind of processing the raw data suffer in order to become an image. This distribution has been mostly used for one look data. In this paper the multilook case is considered for both quadratic and linear detections. A closed (recursive) computational form is provided for the K cumulative distribution function, as well as the estimators derived from the substitution method. The sensitivity of the cumulative distribution function, with respect to possible discretizations of the parameters due to limitations imposed by the recursive form is discussed. The recursive form of the cumulative distribution function of K multilook random variables is used to perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test of goodness of fit over SAREX data. It is shown that, mainly for forest data, the fit with the K multilook distribution is superior to some of other distributions that frequently appear in the literature. Specifically, the use of the normal distribution for this kind of data is discarded systematically.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Random variables","Distribution functions","Convolution","Distributed computing","Backscatter","Recursive estimation","Performance evaluation","Testing","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical signal processing","forestry","synthetic aperture radar","remote sensing by radar","radar imaging","radar applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","radar remote sensing","terrain mapping","land surface","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","multilook amplitude K distribution","SAR image analysis","nonhomogeneous area","linear detection","quadratic detection","image processing","K cumulative distribution function","recursive form","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test","forest","vegetation mapping","forestry"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399683","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '94 - 1994 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3183/9018/00399683.pdf","startPage":"2173","endPage":"2175 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of multilook amplitude K distribution for SAR image analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=399683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the use of multilook amplitude K distribution for SAR image analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399683/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5044297","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of multilook amplitude K distribution for SAR image analysis","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00399683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035316S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","isNumber":"9018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3183","citationCount":"3","articleId":"399683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":399684,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.A.

For multi-look data incoherently averaged from correlated one-look samples, the authors found that, for better modeling, the number of looks has to assume a non-integer value. A procedure was developed to estimate the equivalent number of looks and the parameter of the K-distribution. Experimental results using NASA/JPL 4-look and 16-1ook polarimetric SAR data substantiated this multi-look K-distribution.

In addition, the coherence magnitude between the images is often used as a measure of the quality of the data and the processing. By modeling the SAR image data as independent circular Gaussian random variates, the authors develop the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates for interferogram phase, coherence magnitude, and the variance of the underlying circular Gaussian distribution. They show that the ML estimate of interferogram phase is equivalent to the standard technique of computing the phase of averaged complex returns. The ML estimate of the coherence magnitude depends on the estimated interferogram phase. In comparison, the sample coherence magnitude estimate based on amplitudes alone is badly biased. They also derive the Cramer-Rao bound for each ML estimate. The ML estimate of interferogram phase is close to this bound for moderate to high coherence values. Similarly, the coherence magnitude is close to the bound for values of coherence greater than approximately 1/2. For coherence magnitudes less than 1/2, the ML estimate of coherence magnitude is biased for data samples sizes up to 16 samples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399711/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5038998","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation for SAR interferometry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood estimation for SAR interferometry","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00399711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02258S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1994","isNumber":"9018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3183","citationCount":"96","articleId":"399711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":399740,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The Petri net model of the class of FMS considered is a bounded asymmetric choice net called PAC net. In this paper, we propose a deadlock avoidance control policy based on the structural analysis of Petri nets. Our method first adds the \"local control places\" to ensure that the minimal deadlocks which are not trapped remain always marked. We then prove that the restriction of the augmented net's evolution to safe markings (states) is sufficient to avoid any global deadlock. The safety property is defined in terms of a marking condition on the \"local control places\" and the principle of the method \"never grant a resource that takes the system from a safe to an unsafe state\" is easy to implement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399892/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4966498","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient deadlock avoidance control policy in FMS using structural analysis of Petri nets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient deadlock avoidance control policy in FMS using structural analysis of Petri nets","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00399892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037696S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3184","citationCount":"16","articleId":"399892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":399911,"authors":[{"name":"Hahn-Ming Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hahn-Ming Lee","id":"37087215741"},{"name":"Bing-Hui Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bing-Hui Lu","id":"37087295804"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2129-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"399911","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Knowledge engineering","Neurons","Knowledge acquisition","Electronic mail","Expert systems","Artificial neural networks","Fuzzy set theory","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge based systems","fuzzy neural nets","inference mechanisms","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy rule-based neural network model","knowledge-based fuzzy neural network model","approximate domain knowledge revision","KBFNN","approximate fuzzy rules","fuzzy neurons","S-neurons","G-neurons","LR-type fuzzy numbers","knowledge-based evaluator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=399911","abstract":"In this paper, a knowledge-based fuzzy neural network model, named KBFNN, is proposed.

Indeed, the size of real world problems is often very high, especially if numerous contextual parameters are used. This often leads to a prohibitive size for neural networks taken in their monolithic version. On the other hand, the absence of this context will destinate the work to a specific domain of application. These remarks are all the more accurate as we know that this contextual parameters generally have a continuous effect on the process and that they could be considered as specific modulators of the application. We present here a learning algorithm for neuro-controllers with reduced number of inputs. In fact, the contextual parameters are only used to estimate the synaptic weights of the neuro-controller with other NNs. Moreover, the present version is an online economic solution to this problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1994.399995","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1132 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3184/9020/00399995.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1994.399995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly adaptive neural networks for adaptive neuro-control: the OWE architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Size control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurocontrollers","adaptive control","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly adaptive neural networks","adaptive neuro-control","OWE architecture","orthogonal weight estimator","learning algorithm","synaptic weights estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/399995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Highly adaptive neural networks for adaptive neuro-control: the OWE architecture","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4980280","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly adaptive neural networks for adaptive neuro-control: the OWE architecture","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00399995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025014S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3184","citationCount":"1","articleId":"399995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
