The performance of PROOFS has been substantially improved in HOPE. In HOPE, a systematic way of screening out faults with short propagation zone is proposed. We propose several new techniques which further reduce the fault simulation time of HOPE. The new techniques are: functional fault injection, static fault ordering by fanout free regions and dynamic fault ordering of potentially detected faults. The three methods are incorporated into HOPE and called HOPE1.1. HOPE1.1 shows significant improvement in performance for all the benchmark circuits experimented as compared to HOPE. Experimental results show that HOPE1.1 is especially effective for large circuits.

A serious drawback of OBDD's is the need for application-specific heuristic algorithms to order the variables before processing. Further, for many problem instances in logic synthesis, the heuristic ordering algorithms which have been proposed are insufficient to allow OBDD operations to complete within a limited amount of memory. The paper proposes a solution to these problems based on having the OBDD package itself determine and maintain the variable order. This is done by periodically applying a minimization algorithm to reorder the variables of the OBDD to reduce its size. A new OBDD minimization algorithm, called the sifting algorithm, is proposed and appears especially effective in reducing the size of the OBDD. Experiments with dynamic variable ordering on the problem of forming the OBDD's for the primary outputs of a combinational circuit show that many computations complete using dynamic variable ordering when the same computation fails otherwise.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580029","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4431/12568/00580029.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic variable ordering for ordered binary decision diagrams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580029/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic variable ordering for ordered binary decision diagrams","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979658","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic variable ordering for ordered binary decision diagrams","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00580029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114748S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isNumber":"12568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4431","citationCount":"440","articleId":"580029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":580040,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The choice depends on the location of the CLB into which the output node will be mapped as well as the interconnection with those already mapped CLBs. To deal with such a complicated interaction among multiple output nodes, multiple ways of mappings and multiple CLBs, any greedy algorithms will be insufficient. Instead, we use a bipartite weighted matching algorithm to find a globally optimum solution. With the availability of the partial placement information.

A performance metric for a circuit is the cycle time of the clock signal. Correct circuit operation requires that all paths have a delay that lies between an upper bound and a lower bound. Traditional approaches in delay optimization for combinational circuits have dealt with methods to decrease the delay of the longest path. We address the issue of satisfying the lower bound constraints. Such a problem also arises in wave pipelining of circuits. We propose to handle short path constraints as a post processing step after traditional delay optimization techniques. There are two issues presented in this paper. We first discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for successful delay insertion without increasing delays of any long paths. In the second part, we present a naive approach to padding delays (greedy heuristic) and an algorithm based on linear programming.

This class has the flavor of traditional channeled gate arrays or standard cells and is exemplified by the Actel family of FPGAs. However, unlike conventional standard cell designs, the FPGA routing channels contain predefined wiring segments of various lengths which may be interconnected using antifuses. This paper develops analytical models that permit the design of FPGA routing channels and the analysis of the routability of row-based FPGAs devices based on a generic characterization of the row-based FPGA routing algorithms. In particular, it demonstrates that (using probabilistic models for the origination point and length for connections) an FPGA with properly designed segment length and distribution can be nearly as efficient as a mask-programmable channel (in terms of number of tracks required for routing a given interconnection specification). Experimental results corroborate this prediction. In addition, this paper provides a method for evaluating various channel architectures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture and routability analysis for row-based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580062","startPage":"230","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12568","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4431/12568/00580062.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Architecture and routability analysis for row-based FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979690","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture and routability analysis for row-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00580062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03043S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isNumber":"12568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4431","citationCount":"2","articleId":"580062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":580064,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The main feature of QuickCut is a \"neighborhood search\" strategy that is based on the result (obtained in this paper) that it is not necessary to search more than a certain subset of d/sup 2/ node pairs to find the node pair with the maximum swap gain. Here d is the maximum node degree of G. We also use an improved data structure, viz., balanced trees, to store the nodes in the two partitions. Due to the new search strategy and data structure, QuickCut has a worst-case time complexity of /spl Theta/(max(ed, e log n)), and an average-case complexity of /spl Theta/(e log n), where e is the number of edges of G. The K-L algorithm, on the other hand, has a time complexity of /spl Theta/(n/sup 2/ log n), where n is the number of nodes of G. Another contribution of this paper is the presentation of efficient node-pair scanning methods for obtaining the best node pair to swap in the K-L algorithm. We have implemented QuickCut, K-L, and its various enhancements suggested here. The results obtained from using these different algorithms to partition a number of random and other well-defined graphs show that QuickCut is the fastest, and that it is faster than the K-L algorithm by factors of 5 to 50. Thus QuickCut can serve as the basis for very fast VLSI partitioning and layout tools.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580083","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4431/12568/00580083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12568","startPage":"370","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New faster Kernighan-Lin-type graph-partitioning algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New faster Kernighan-Lin-type graph-partitioning algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580083/","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979711","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New faster Kernighan-Lin-type graph-partitioning algorithms","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00580083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05304S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isNumber":"12568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4431","citationCount":"36","articleId":"580083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":580087,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Given a general clock network, which may includes loops, together with a set of feasible widths for each branch, we formulate the optimal sizing of the clock network as a constrained optimization problem. By turning the skew minimization problem into a least-squares estimation problem, a modified Gauss-Marquardt's method is used to determine the optimal widths. An efficient initial sizing algorithm is proposed to speed up the sizing process. Instead of using zero-order delay model (path length) or one-order delay model (Elmore delay), we employ a generalized delay model which can handle general RLC and transmission line networks.

In order to ensure that these performance gains are realized, it is required that the underlying data flow graph (DFG) have no accumulation of data at its nodes. Hence, all operands should arrive simultaneously at a multi-input operation node. Buffers are therefore inserted to ensure these conditions. An algorithm for buffer distribution in a balanced DFG of order (V /spl times/ E) is proposed. The number of buffers in the proposed buffer distribution strategy is equal to the minimum number of buffers achieved by integer programming techniques. An extension of this algorithm, of order (V/sup 2/ /spl times/ log V) is proposed which can further reduce the number of buffers by altering the DFG while keeping the functionality and performance of the DFG intact. Performance results showing the improvement of these algorithms over the existing ones have been shown.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Computer architecture","Clocks","Throughput","Flow graphs","Linear programming","Delay","Computer science","Performance gain","Distribution strategy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer assignment","data driven architectures","performance gains","underlying data flow graph","multi-input operation node","buffer distribution","balanced DFG","buffer distribution strategy","integer programming techniques"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580158","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4431/12568/00580158.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer assignment for data driven architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Buffer assignment for data driven architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580158/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979754","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer assignment for data driven architectures","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00580158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046918S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isNumber":"12568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4431","citationCount":"2","articleId":"580158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":580162,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-T.

In this paper, we present a new EVBDD application for solving integer linear programs (ILP), which is an NP-hard problem that appears in many applications. Our approach is to combine the benefits of the EVBDD data structure (in terms of subgraph sharing and caching of computational results) with the state-of-the-art ILP solving techniques. Our program, called FGILP (Function Graph ILP) has been implemented in C under the SIS environment. The preliminary results of FGILP are comparable to those of LINDO.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580162","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4431/12568/00580162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12568","startPage":"685","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FGILP: An integer linear program solver based on function graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FGILP: An integer linear program solver based on function graphs","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580162/","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979758","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FGILP: An integer linear program solver based on function graphs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00580162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034061S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isNumber":"12568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4431","citationCount":"8","articleId":"580162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":580164,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In the near future coupled capacitance could contribute as much as 50-75% to the interconnect delay which has been largely ignored by performance-oriented layout tools. Given a routed design, this work minimizes the delay and the peak cross-talk by re-adjusting the space between interconnects. It can reduce the circuit delay significantly and, in addition, reduce the peak cross-talk problem.

Memory allocation techniques are used in high level synthesis for foreground and background memory allocation, the design of data format converters, and the design of synchronous inter-processor communication hardware. The techniques presented in this paper differ from other approaches in the sense that data streams are considered to be design entities and are not expanded to individual samples. A formal model for hierarchical data streams is given and a memory allocation algorithm is presented. The algorithm comprises two steps: data routing and assignment of signal delays to memories. A number of sub-problems are formulated as ILP programs. In the presented form, the allocation algorithm only considers interconnect costs, but memory size and other cost factors can be taken into account. The presented work is implemented in the memory allocation tool MEDEA which is part of the PHIDEO synthesis system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580169","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4431/12568/00580169.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1993.580169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation of multiport memories for hierarchical data streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Allocation of multiport memories for hierarchical data streams","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4979765","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation of multiport memories for hierarchical data streams","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00580169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059663S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 1993","isNumber":"12568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4431","citationCount":"56","articleId":"580169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":580180,"authors":[{"name":"Jiantin Wu","affiliation":["Northern Bell Research, Ottawa, Canada"],"lastName":"Jiantin Wu","id":"37066367800"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"lastName":"Shu Lin","id":"37276533700"},{"name":"T.

In this way, for the proposed scheme, one can achieve a large minimum Euclidean distance while the number of nearest neighbors is not too large. The authors also design a multi-stage decoding algorithm, which is optimum in each stage and has low decoding complexity. Three specific examples are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12565/00580199.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coded modulation scheme with interblock memory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","Decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Quadrature phase shift keying","Nearest neighbor searches","Block codes","Signal to noise ratio","Binary codes","Bandwidth","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","modulation","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interblock memory","coded modulation scheme","multistage coding structure","coding designs","minimum Euclidean distance","multistage decoding algorithm","decoding complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"A coded modulation scheme with interblock memory","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February-April 1994","accessionNumber":"4684432","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coded modulation scheme with interblock memory","sourcePdf":"00580199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030644S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"580199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":580200,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This procedure does not require a startup sequence for estimating the channel impulse response. Rather, the data and the channel are simultaneously estimated. It is implemented without any loss of optimality by a trellis search algorithm which searches for the best data sequence from among a number of hypothesized trellises which are constructed from the observed sequence. The number of states in each trellis and the number of trellises grow exponentially with the channel memory. A suboptimal trellis search algorithm is proposed whose complexity at best is slightly higher than that of the adaptive Viterbi algorithm operating with a known channel response. A simplified channel estimation algorithm when the number of data alphabets is greater than 2 is also proposed. Fast convergence of the algorithm in estimating the channel is demonstrated for binary pulse amplitude modulation over a variety of channels. Convergence over a wide range of SNR occurs within 100 symbols. The channel estimation algorithm for multi-level signals converges within 500-1000 symbols. We finally present an application of this algorithm to the problem of sequence estimation in the presence of rapidly time-varying intersymbol interference. The algorithm provides reliable zero-delay decisions which results in a better channel tracking algorithm when compared to previously proposed schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12565/00580208.pdf","endPage":"1011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data and channel estimation using blind trellis search techniques","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580208","startPage":"1000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Joint data and channel estimation using blind trellis search techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580208/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4688886","publicationDate":"February-April 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"234","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data and channel estimation using blind trellis search techniques","sourcePdf":"00580208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025954S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"189","articleId":"580208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":580209,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The results are then used for the case of narrowband transmission. New phenomena occur with wideband transmission. This paper presents an analysis of the mitigation of the Rayleigh fading effect for wideband direct sequence code division multiple access (DS/CDMA) signaling. There are measurements that show this phenomenon. The reduction of the Rayleigh fading effect is an advantage of CDMA over narrowband transmission systems and it eases the burden of CDMA power control. A general expression for the coefficient of variation of the received wideband signal power is derived. It is shown how the coefficient of variation of the received power decreases as the bandwidth spreading increases. This paper also analyzes the time correlation needed for other analyses (e.g., CDMA power control).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12565/00580209.pdf","startPage":"1012","endPage":"1016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rayleigh fading effect reduction with wideband DS/CDMA signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Narrowband","Power control","Land mobile radio","Frequency","Signal analysis","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Genetic expression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","code division multiple access","radiowave propagation","mobile radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading effect reduction","mobile radio","wideband transmission","DS/CDMA signals","direct sequence code division multiple access signaling","received wideband signal power","bandwidth spreading","time correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Rayleigh fading effect reduction with wideband DS/CDMA signals","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February-April 1994","accessionNumber":"4688887","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rayleigh fading effect reduction with wideband DS/CDMA signals","sourcePdf":"00580209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035007S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","articleId":"580209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":580210,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

It is first shown that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence probabilities can be approximated using the innovations likelihoods generated by a parallel bank of Kalman filters. These filters generate a set of channel estimates conditioned on the possible symbol subsequences contributing to the intersymbol interference. The conditional estimates and MAP symbol metrics are then combined using a suboptimum Bayesian formula. Two methods are considered to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. First, the technique of reduced-state sequence estimation is adopted to reduce the number of symbol subsequences considered in the channel estimation process and hence the number of parallel filters required. Second, it is shown that the Kalman filters can be replaced by simpler least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filters. A computational complexity analysis of the LMS Bayesian equalizer demonstrates that its implementation in parallel programmable digital signal processing devices is feasible at 16 kbps. The performance of the resulting algorithms is evaluated through bit-error-rate simulations, which are compared to the performance bounds of the maximum-likelihood sequence estimator. It is shown that the Kalman filter and LMS-based algorithms achieve blind start-up and rapid convergence (typically within 200 iterations) for both BPSK and QPSK modulation formats.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12565","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1032","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12565/00580210.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian algorithms for blind equalization using parallel adaptive filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian algorithms for blind equalization using parallel adaptive filtering","publicationDate":"February-April 1994","accessionNumber":"4688888","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"234","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian algorithms for blind equalization using parallel adaptive filtering","sourcePdf":"00580210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047696S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"65","articleId":"580210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":580211,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

Comparisons with traditional decoding schemes show that the proposed solution has better performance in terms of acquisition time and cycle slips.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12565/00580211.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate ML decoding of coded PSK with no explicit carrier phase reference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Phase estimation","Constellation diagram","Signal design","Maximum likelihood detection","Viterbi algorithm","Detection algorithms","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","phase shift keying","trellis codes","estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate method","decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","coded PSK sequences","unknown carrier phase","Viterbi algorithm","encoder trellis diagram","phase estimation","detection algorithm","branch metrics","trellis coded modulation","cycle slips","acquisition time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Approximate ML decoding of coded PSK with no explicit carrier phase reference","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February-April 1994","accessionNumber":"4688889","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate ML decoding of coded PSK with no explicit carrier phase reference","sourcePdf":"00580211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045327S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","articleId":"580211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":580214,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The improvement in performance compared to FSK can be up to 15 dB depending on the characteristics of the channel.

To meet this requirement, we define a real-time channel as a unidirectional connection between two nodes in such a network that guarantees every packet to be delivered before a user-defined, end-to-end deadline. The goal of this paper is to lay a mathematical basis for the problem of establishing real-time channels by (i) deriving a necessary and sufficient condition for the schedulability of a set of channels over a link, and (ii) developing an efficient method for calculating the minimum delay bound over a link for each channel. Given the traffic characteristics of a channel, our results can be used to check whether or not every packet will be delivered within a pre-specified delay bound.

With a view to designing algorithms to execute on-line in a system, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem and study the use of stochastic approximation techniques. Given the distributed nature of the problem, we extend previous results obtained for a single node to the case where several nodes operate simultaneously and in an asynchronous manner.

Based on the complete statistical characterization of the Stokes parameters, extracted through appropriate signal processing in the presence of shot and additive Gaussian noise, the optimum maximum likelihood receiver operating symbol by symbol is derived. The exact performance in terms of the average symbol error probability is found. Optimum constellations for the case of equipower 4, 8, 16 and 32 signals are found on the basis of the minimization of the error probability for a given average power. Their performance turns out to be promising as compared to other standard modulation techniques. The spectral analysis of polarization modulated signals is presented.

Since the channel fading is due to multipath propagation, the received signal contains multipath or time diversity which is resolved at the receiver by a RAKE-structure. The maximum-likelihood (ML) rule is invoked to estimate the phases, and the combining factors of the receiving paths, as well as the frequency offset between the carrier of the receiver and the transmitter. The ML algorithm is simplified by using decision-directed feedback. The resulting digital algorithms for synchronization, data demodulation, and frequency error detection (FED) are well suited for digital implementation because of their fairly low numerical complexity. Analytical expressions of the bit error probability versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and versus frequency offset are presented. In addition, experimental results using Monte-Carlo simulations have also been carried out. The results show a negligible influence of the decision-direction above a certain SNR, as well as a \"robust\" transient behavior of the phase estimation and the automatic frequency control (AFC) scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12565/00580239.pdf","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coherent spread-spectrum diversity-receiver with AFC for multipath fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580239/","displayDocTitle":"A coherent spread-spectrum diversity-receiver with AFC for multipath fading channels","volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"February-April 1994","accessionNumber":"4688917","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coherent spread-spectrum diversity-receiver with AFC for multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"00580239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039845S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","articleId":"580239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":580241,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The modified CRB proves useful when, in addition to the parameter to be estimated, the observed data also depend on other unwanted parameters. The relationship between the modified and true CRB is established and applications are discussed regarding the estimation of carrier-frequency offset, carrier phase, and timing epoch in linearly modulated signals. Modified CRBs for phase and timing estimation have been already discussed in previous works where it is shown that several practical carrier-phase and clock recovery circuits do attain such bounds. Frequency discrimination, instead, is not so well-represented in the literature and a significant contribution of this paper is the calculation of the modified CRB for frequency estimation. This bound is compared with the performance of some frequency detectors and it is concluded that further work is needed in search of more efficient frequency discrimination methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.580247","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12565/00580247.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The modified Cramer-Rao bound and its application to synchronization problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"The modified Cramer-Rao bound and its application to synchronization problems","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4688925","publicationDate":"February-April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The modified Cramer-Rao bound and its application to synchronization problems","sourcePdf":"00580247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03502S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"390","articleId":"580247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":580248,"authors":[{"name":"Seok Chang Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seok Chang Kim","id":"38150135900"},{"name":"Byeong Gi Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeong Gi Lee","id":"37281113300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"580248","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":88},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shift registers","Decision support systems","Frequency selective surfaces","Asynchronous transfer mode","Costs","Spread spectrum communication","Mathematical model","Communication switching","Communications Society","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences","asynchronous transfer mode","synchronisation","digital communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shift register generators","synchronization","distributed sample scramblers","frame synchronous scramblers","ATM scrambling","mathematical modeling","descrambler"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a theory is developed to support the synchronization of shift register generators (SRG) in the distributed sample scramblers (DSS).

Examples include medical image processing and radar signal processing. One drawback of the histogram equalization can be found on the fact that the brightness of an image can be changed after the histogram equalization, which is mainly due to the flattening property of the histogram equalization. Thus, it is rarely utilized in consumer electronic products such as TV where preserving the original input brightness may be necessary in order not to introduce unnecessary visual deterioration. This paper proposes a novel extension of histogram equalization to overcome such a drawback of histogram equalization. The essence of the proposed algorithm is to utilize independent histogram equalizations separately over two subimages obtained by decomposing the input image based on its mean with a constraint that the resulting equalized subimages are bounded by each other around the input mean. It is shown mathematically that the proposed algorithm preserves the mean brightness of a given image significantly well compared to typical histogram equalization while enhancing the contrast and, thus, provides a natural enhancement that can be utilized in consumer electronic products.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1997","volume":"43","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5548636","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Contrast enhancement using brightness preserving bi-histogram equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contrast enhancement using brightness preserving bi-histogram equalization","sourcePdf":"00580378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026224S","chronDate":"Feb 1997","isNumber":"12594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"849","articleId":"580378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":580381,"authors":[{"name":"Sangjoong Kim","affiliation":["New Media Service Sec., Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sangjoong Kim","id":"37069758900"},{"name":"Yonggil Kim","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Ajou University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yonggil Kim","id":"37859346500"},{"name":"Kangbin Yim","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Ajou University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kangbin Yim","id":"37397620600"},{"name":"Hwaja Chung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, PSNU"],"lastName":"Hwaja Chung","id":"37856737300"},{"name":"Kyunghee Choi","affiliation":["School of I.E. & C.E, Ajou University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyunghee Choi","id":"37348632600"},{"name":"Yongdeak Kim","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Ajou University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yongdeak Kim","id":"37280930900"},{"name":"Gihyun Jung","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Ajou University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gihyun Jung","id":"37347291800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"580381","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":34},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"abstract":"We modify the three step search (TSS) algorithm to be applicable to real-time system, based on the statistics of motion vector distribution and propose a new architecture.

A cost evaluation function allows us to select the most convenient solution in terms of overhead and the final 100% TSC circuit.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12592","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel3/4438/12592/00580407.pdf","doi":"10.1109/GLSV.1997.580407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLSV.1997.580407","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parity bit code: achieving a complete fault coverage in the design of TSC combinational networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580407/","displayDocTitle":"Parity bit code: achieving a complete fault coverage in the design of TSC combinational networks","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 1997","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5609247","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parity bit code: achieving a complete fault coverage in the design of TSC combinational networks","confLoc":"Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00580407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038761S","chronDate":"13-15 Mar 1997","isNumber":"12592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438","citationCount":"4","articleId":"580407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":580414,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This is because the total capacitance being switched when a voltage change occurs on a bus line is usually sensibly larger than the capacitive load that must be charged/discharged when internal nodes toggle. In this paper, we propose an encoding scheme which is suitable for reducing the switching activity on the lines of an address bus. The technique relies on the observation that, in a remarkable number of cases, patterns traveling onto address buses are consecutive. Under this condition it may therefore be possible, for the devices located at the receiving end of the bus, to automatically calculate the address to be received at the next clock cycle; consequently, the transmission of the new pattern can be avoided, resulting in an overall switching activity decrease. We present analytical and experimental analyses showing the improved performance of our encoding scheme when compared to both binary and Gray addressing schemes, the latter being widely accepted as the most efficient method for address bus encoding. We also propose power and timing efficient implementations of the encoding and the decoding logic, and we discuss the applicability of the technique to real microprocessor-based designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 1997","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5609254","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic zero-transition activity encoding for address busses in low-power microprocessor-based systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic zero-transition activity encoding for address busses in low-power microprocessor-based systems","confLoc":"Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00580414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049043S","chronDate":"13-15 March 1997","isNumber":"12592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438","citationCount":"160","articleId":"580414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":580416,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We model the channel outages as statistically correlated errors. Classic ARQ strategies are found to lead to a considerable waste of energy, due to the large number of transmissions. The use of finite energy sources in the face of dependent channel errors leads to new protocol design criteria. As an example, a simple probing scheme, which slows down the transmission rate when the channel is impaired, is show? to be more energy efficient, with a slight loss in throughput. A modified scheme that yields slightly better performance but requires some additional complexity is also studied. Some references on the modeling of battery cells are discussed to highlight the fact that battery charge capacity is strongly influenced by the available \"relaxation time\" between current pulses. A formal approach that can track complex models for power sources, including dynamic charge recovery, is also developed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/12588/00580424.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.580424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.580424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error control and energy consumption in communications for nomadic computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Energy consumption","Batteries","Protocols","Energy efficiency","Portable computers","Wireless communication","Automatic repeat request","Power system modeling","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless LAN","computer power supplies","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nomadic computing","energy consumption","wireless channel","portable devices","ARQ strategies","battery charge capacity","dynamic charge recovery","protocol design","mobile computing","mobile communications","wireless systems","error control","channel probing","battery modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Error control and energy consumption in communications for nomadic computing","volume":"46","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5542554","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error control and energy consumption in communications for nomadic computing","sourcePdf":"00580424.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051127S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"119","articleId":"580424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":580432,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Publications show how some classes of power systems and electromagnetic problems are solved using artificial neural networks. Some students at the American University of Beirut, willing to further their careers along academic lines or in research and development, are encouraged to take special projects to investigate and laydown the foundation for more serious research. Two such developments are reported in this paper. The first is a neural network-based automatic mesh generation method capable of developing meshes that preserve major properties such as Delauney triangulation and Dirichlet tessellation. In the second application, we demonstrated the possibility of creating a single artificial neural network to estimate the critical clearing time of faults in a realistic power system with differing load levels, fault locations, and network topologies.","doi":"10.1109/FIE.1994.580605","startPage":"567","endPage":"572","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference - FIE '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.1994.580605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12614","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference - FIE '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/4449/12614/00580605.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks: a new approach for treating electrical engineering problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580605/","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks: a new approach for treating electrical engineering problems","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4985977","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks: a new approach for treating electrical engineering problems","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00580605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024191S","chronDate":"2-6 Nov 1994","isNumber":"12614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4449","citationCount":"2","articleId":"580605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":580709,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This concentration of data, together with the burstiness caused by the simultaneous trigger of data sources for every event would inevitably produce congestion in the switching fabrics unless traffic shaping is applied at the input. We have studied several traffic shaping schemes. These include three types of barrel shifters and a traffic randomization method. For the latter case we have designed and implemented hardware components, based on ASICs and FPGAs, that will be integrated in a VME based ATM data source module.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Sep 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5218693","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based ATM traffic shaper for event-building networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based ATM traffic shaper for event-building networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00580709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03407S","chronDate":"18-22 Sep 1995","isNumber":"12613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4448","articleId":"580709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":580721,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The uplink of a coherent DS-CDMA system is investigated. The channel estimation is carried out via a control channel, which is transmitted simultaneously to the data channel. This concept is very closely related to the CODIT-CDMA concept. In the channel estimation, an averaging process is involved, which for long averaging periods, suppresses the noise influence efficiently. On the other hand, long averaging intervals lead to systematic errors in the estimated channel coefficients due to the time-variant behavior of the channel. Taking into account these effects, a closed-form analysis of the data-channel symbol-error rate (SER) is presented. This analysis allows the prediction of the system's performance and helps to optimize the parameter settings for channel estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of channel estimation on the performance of a coherent DS-CDMA system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.580764","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/12620/00580764.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.580764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Influence of channel estimation on the performance of a coherent DS-CDMA system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587908","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of channel estimation on the performance of a coherent DS-CDMA system","sourcePdf":"00580764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041014S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","articleId":"580764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":580767,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.

However, it would be inevitable for these distributed schemes to lose some system performance compared to a centralized one since they control their power level based on only the local C/I measurements. An efficient distributed power-control (DPC) scheme is proposed to maximize the system performance. A distributed C/I balancing algorithm is suggested, which converges fast and is robust to C/I estimation errors. A simple instability detection rule is also suggested to accelerate the balancing phase of DPC schemes. Numerical results indicate that our algorithm achieves improvements in terms of the outage probability as well as the algorithm speed. Robustness to the C/I measurement errors is also explored.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/12620/00580769.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.580769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.580769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient distributed power control for cellular mobile systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","System performance","Robustness","Centralized control","Control systems","Power measurement","Estimation error","Phase detection","Acceleration","Measurement errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","power control","telecommunication control","centralised control","distributed control","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","numerical stability","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular mobile systems","distributed power control","distributed carrier-to-interference balancing","system performance","centralized power control","local C/I measurements","distributed C/I balancing algorithm","C/I estimation errors","instability detection rule","outage probability","algorithm speed","C/I measurement errors","algorithm convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Efficient distributed power control for cellular mobile systems","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient distributed power control for cellular mobile systems","sourcePdf":"00580769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049665S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","articleId":"580769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":580770,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

A suite of fixed, but arbitrarily programmable low-rate, perceptually weighted vector quantized (VQ) codecs with and without run-length compression (RLC) are contrived for quarter common intermediate format (QCIF) videophone sequences. The 11.36-kb/s Codec 1 is Bose-Chaudhuri-Hochquenghem (BCH) (127,71,9) coded to a rate of 20.32 kb/s and this arrangement is comparatively studied along with the 8-kb/s Codec 2 and BCH (127,50,13) scheme, which has the same 20.32-kb/s overall rate. The source-sensitivity matched Systems 1-6 characterized in a table were contrived to comparatively study the range of system design options. For example, using Codec 1 in System 1 and coherent pilot symbol assisted 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-PSAQAM), an overall signaling rate of 9 kBd was yielded, if the noise-limited channel had a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in excess of about 22 dB in the vicinity of the basestation or in indoors scenarios. In contrast, over lower quality outdoors channels near the fringes of the cell, the more robust 4-QAM mode of operation had to be invoked, which required twice as many time slots to accommodate the resulting 18-kBd stream and hence, reduced the total number of users supported. The robustness of Systems 2-4, and 6 was increased using automatic repeat requests (ARQ), again, inevitably reducing the number of users supported, which was between 6 and 16. In a bandwidth of 200 kHz, similarly to the Pan-European GSM mobile radio system's speech channel, using Systems 1, 3, 4, or 5, for example, 16 and eight videophone users can be supported in the 16- and 4-QAM modes, respectively, while in dual-mode cells the number of users is between eight and 16. The basic system characteristics are highlighted.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/12620/00580772.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.580772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.580772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-mode vector-quantized low-rate cordless videophone systems for indoors and outdoors applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videophone systems","Codecs","Noise robustness","Signal to noise ratio","Quadrature phase shift keying","Automatic repeat request","Transceivers","Interference","Video compression","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector quantisation","land mobile radio","indoor radio","transceivers","video codecs","videotelephony","cordless telephone systems","BCH codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","automatic repeat request","cellular radio","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-rate cordless videophone systems","indoor applications","outdoor applications","dual-mode wireless videophone transceivers","vector quantization","video quality","bit rate","robustness","complexity","perceptually weighted vector quantized codecs","run length compression","quarter common intermediate format","videophone sequences","BCH codes","system design","coherent pilot symbol assisted 16QAM","signaling rate","noise-limited channel","signal-to-noise ratio","basestation","4-QAM","automatic repeat requests","GSM","11.36 kbit/s","20.32 kbit/s","8 kbit/s","200 kHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Dual-mode vector-quantized low-rate cordless videophone systems for indoors and outdoors applications","volume":"46","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587915","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-mode vector-quantized low-rate cordless videophone systems for indoors and outdoors applications","sourcePdf":"00580772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166064S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","articleId":"580772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":580773,"authors":[{"name":"N.

With the strong motivation toward portable radio and personal communication systems, power limitation has manifest itself in the picture, and, consequently, nonlinear operation of the amplifiers involved (hence, the channel) will have to be dealt with. Constant envelope modulation schemes have been used in digital mobile radio systems recently installed. The Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) is employed in the Global System for Mobile (GSM) communications installed in Europe, while in the North American IS-54 system, the modulation scheme used is the /spl pi//4-DQPSK. As the quest for higher data rates has kept on increasing, multilevel modulation schemes have been proposed with their performance over nonlinear channels having been overlooked. The paper provides a comparative study, based on simulation, and tests the performance of various modulation schemes operating over a wide variety of mobile radio channel conditions. The effective throughput of all systems is also considered.","doi":"10.1109/25.580777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/12620/00580777.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.580777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12620","startPage":"390","endPage":"395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the /spl pi//4-DQPSK, GMSK, and QAM modulation schemes in mobile radio with multipath fading and nonlinearities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the /spl pi//4-DQPSK, GMSK, and QAM modulation schemes in mobile radio with multipath fading and nonlinearities","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580777/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587920","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the /spl pi//4-DQPSK, GMSK, and QAM modulation schemes in mobile radio with multipath fading and nonlinearities","sourcePdf":"00580777.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034345S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","articleId":"580777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":580779,"authors":[{"name":"Tjeng Thiang Tjhung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Centre for Wireless Communications, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Tjeng Thiang Tjhung","id":"37276664700"},{"name":"Chin Choy Chai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Centre for Wireless Communications, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Chin Choy Chai","id":"37276677500"},{"name":"Xiaodai Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Centre for Wireless Communications, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xiaodai Dong","id":"37065012700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"580779","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":747},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Shadow mapping","Land mobile radio","Protection","Microwave communication","Microcell networks","Loss measurement","Propagation losses","Wireless communication","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["log normal distribution","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","Rician channels","fading","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","lognormal-shadowed Rician channels","Rician signal","Rician interferers","Rayleigh signal","Rayleigh interferers","lognormal shadowing","microcellular mobile radio systems","normalized reuse distance","cluster size","Rician fading environments"]}],"abstract":"A new general outage probability expression for a Rician signal received among L Rician interferers is derived.

In fact, packet voice can efficiently exploit speech on-off activity to improve bandwidth utilization over time division multiple access (TDMA). Such an approach has been first suggested in the packet reservation multiple-access (PRMA) technique, an adaptation of the reservation ALOHA protocol to the cellular environment. However, being PRMA-based on a fixed frame scheme, it cannot thoroughly take advantage of the very short propagation delays encountered in microcellular systems that allow, for instance, the immediate retransmission of packets lost because of the interference noise from adjacent cells. We present the centralized PRMA, a natural enhancement of PRMA, in which the base station (BS) plays a central role in scheduling the transmissions of mobile stations (MSs). As a consequence, the transmission scheduling is very flexible and can account for the different traffic rate and delay constraints that emerge from voice and data integration. A packet retransmission policy to recover corrupted packets can be implemented and operated efficiently to provide an acceptable grade of service, even in a very noisy environment. The simulation results presented show the quantitative improvements of the centralized packet reservation multiple-access (C-PRMA) performance with respect to PRMA.","doi":"10.1109/25.580781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"422","endPage":"436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.580781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12620","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/12620/00580781.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation delay","Time division multiple access","Working environment noise","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Speech","Bandwidth","Access protocols","Interference","Base stations","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet reservation multiple access","cellular radio","access protocols","data communication","land mobile radio","voice communication","delays","packet radio networks","scheduling","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C-PRMA","centralized packet reservation multiple access","local wireless communications","packet-switched technology","cellular radio systems","short propagation delay","voice transmission","packet voice","bandwidth utilization","packet reservation multiple-access","reservation ALOHA protocol","microcellular systems","interference noise","simulation results","base station","transmission scheduling","mobile stations","traffic rate","delay constraints","voice-data integration","packet retransmission policy","grade of service","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"C-PRMA: a centralized packet reservation multiple access for local wireless communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580781/","volume":"46","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5587924","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C-PRMA: a centralized packet reservation multiple access for local wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00580781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039191S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"60","articleId":"580781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":580783,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The reliability of the radio link is investigated by specifying the radio spectrum occupation for a given required reliability of the radio link.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.580791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12620","startPage":"528","endPage":"536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/12620/00580791.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle-to-vehicle communications for AVCS platooning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vehicle-to-vehicle communications for AVCS platooning","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5587934","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle-to-vehicle communications for AVCS platooning","sourcePdf":"00580791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03672S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"57","articleId":"580791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":580792,"authors":[{"name":"N.

As a result, traditional expert systems are not effective in providing reliable analysis, often require a large set of rules, and lack flexibility in terms of learning and modification. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based neural network (FLBN) to develop a case-based system for diagnosing symptoms in electronic systems. We demonstrate through data obtained from a real call-log database that the FLBN is able to perform fuzzy AND/OR logic rules and to learn from samples.

A specific system under consideration is a passive nonlinear line-of-sight (LOS) stabilization system with strong interactions between two channels. By using the concept of decentralized control, a control structure is developed that is composed of two control loops, each of which is associated with a single-variable fuzzy controller and a decoupling unit. A simplified fuzzy control algorithm is used to implement the fuzzy controller. We propose two novel approaches to designing the decoupling units. The first one is based on the theory of fuzzy reasoning whereas the second scheme relies on the principle of adaptation.

The results show that the system SNR is not completely recovered although the signal power is restored after several stages of amplifiers and that there exists the residual degradation of the system SNR. Through a 5.3 Gb/s data transmission experiment over 3000 km, the transmission penalty due to the excess span loss is confirmed to be decided by this residual degradation of the system SNR.

Our model predicts and our experiments substantially verify that the dominant gain saturating mechanism is the Rayleigh backscattered ASE centered around the 1535 nm peak in the ASE spectrum and that the spectral shape of the output ASE becomes much more sharply peaked around the 1535 nm gain peak. In an experimental open cascade of three EDFAs the ASE spectral density at the 1535 nm gain peak is increased by as much as 8-9 dB, resulting in gain compression ranging from 1-2 dB near 1550 nm to as much as 35 dB nearer 1538 nm. This combined with multiple Rayleigh scattering of the ASE around our 1538 and 1540 nm signal wavelengths results in Rayleigh scattering induced reductions of the optical signal to ASE ratio of 1-2 dB at the output of the first amplifier increasing to 36 dB at the output of the third amplifier each signal traverses.","doi":"10.1109/50.580808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.580808","startPage":"749","endPage":"757","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/12618/00580808.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model for bidirectional transmission in an open cascade of optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Model for bidirectional transmission in an open cascade of optical amplifiers","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5579908","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580808/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model for bidirectional transmission in an open cascade of optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00580808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038699S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","articleId":"580808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":580811,"authors":[{"name":"Chiung-Shien Wu","affiliation":["Communication Research Laboratories Chutung, Industrial Computer and Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chiung-Shien Wu","id":"37348118600"},{"name":"Gin-Kou Ma","affiliation":["Communication Research Laboratories Chutung, Industrial Computer and Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Gin-Kou Ma","id":"37287658400"},{"name":"B.-S.P.

Spectroscopic measurements were made on un-oriented samples of this material; excited-state lifetimes and LaCl/sub 3/:Dy/sup 3+/ Judd-Ofelt parameters are reported. Wavelength-resolved absorption and emission cross sections are presented for the 1.3 /spl mu/m W/spl rlhar2/Z band. Pump-probe measurements (using 0.92 /spl mu/m and 1.32 /spl mu/m, respectively) prove that the observed gain properties of LaCl/sub 3/:Dy are consistent with those predicted on the basis of the spectroscopic cross sections.

This beam direction compensating system can suppress the decrease in coupling efficiency between transmitters and receivers to no more than 15%, even if boards are inserted and extracted repeatedly, and are shocked repeatedly at a high intensity of 100 G. The compensation is very fast (20 ms). Furthermore, various optical interconnections necessary for ATM switching networks can be achieved by beam deflectors of a liquid crystal microprism array. In this preliminary study, we fabricate no more than eight-channel optical interconnections.

The technique is suitable for IIR filters processing a finite number of samples in phased array radars. The initialization processor is complex one and utilized the first received sample to force the filter to reach its steady-state value at a single frequency irrespective of the number of processed samples. This is done by initially loading the internal memories of the filter with their steady-state values. If the filter has a zero steady-state response at that particular frequency then this will ensure that the transient frequency responses of the filter will also have a zero response at that frequency.

For an ARX model this lead to a linear regression. The well-known least squares method would then be very desirable since it can have good numerical properties and low computational burden, in particular for fast or nonuniform sampling. It is examined under what conditions a least squares fit for this linear regression will give adequate results for an ARX model. The choice of derivative approximation is crucial for this approach to be useful. Standard approximations like Euler backward or Euler forward cannot be used directly. The precise conditions on the derivative approximation are derived and analyzed. It is shown that if the highest order derivative is selected with care, a least squares estimate will be accurate. The theoretical analysis is complemented by some numerical examples which provide further insight into the choice of derivative approximation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Parameter estimation","Sampling methods","Linear regression","Least squares methods","Autoregressive processes","Control systems","Nonuniform sampling","Astrophysics","Forward contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","least squares approximations","autoregressive processes","discrete time systems","modelling","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least-squares parameter estimation","continuous-time ARX models","discrete-time data","continuous-time parameterization","direct estimation","linear regression","low computational burden","fast sampling","nonuniform sampling","derivative approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/9.580871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/12616/00580871.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.580871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least squares parameter estimation of continuous-time ARX models from discrete-time data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Least squares parameter estimation of continuous-time ARX models from discrete-time data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580871/","volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5587725","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least squares parameter estimation of continuous-time ARX models from discrete-time data","sourcePdf":"00580871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045569S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"100","articleId":"580871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":580873,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Chiou Liou","affiliation":["AT and T Laboratories, Middletown, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Jing-Chiou Liou","id":"37363414700"},{"name":"M.A. Palis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Camden, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Palis","id":"37318658900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-7793-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-7133"}],"articleNumber":"580873","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580873","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Clustering algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Merging","Software algorithms","Load management","Optimizing compilers","Laboratories","Computer science","Parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","processor scheduling","graph theory","resource allocation","distributed memory systems","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor scheduling","two phase method","task clustering","near optimal number of processors","task graph scheduling","task clustering algorithm","load balancing","cluster merging","communication traffic minimizing","CTM","task graphs","distributed memory parallel architectures"]}],"abstract":"The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the two phase method of scheduling, in which task clustering is performed prior to the actual scheduling process. Task clustering determines the optimal or near optimal number of processors on which to schedule the task graph. In other words, there is never a need to use more processors (even though they are available) than the number of clusters produced by the task clustering algorithm. The paper also indicates that when task clustering is performed prior to scheduling, load balancing (LB) is the preferred approach for cluster merging. LB is fast, easy to implement, and produces significantly better final schedules than communication traffic minimizing (CTM). In summary, the two phase method consisting of task clustering and load balancing is a simple, yet highly effective strategy for scheduling task graphs on distributed memory parallel architectures.","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1997.580873","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 11th International Parallel Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 11th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4440/12600/00580873.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1997.580873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of general approaches to multiprocessor scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of general approaches to multiprocessor scheduling","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5559770","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of general approaches to multiprocessor scheduling","confLoc":"Genva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00580873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0615S","chronDate":"1-5 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4440","citationCount":"35","articleId":"580873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":580874,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.

We present a proof of convergence (with probability one), a characterization of the limit of convergence, and a bound on the resulting approximation error. Furthermore, our analysis is based on a new line of reasoning that provides new intuition about the dynamics of temporal-difference learning. In addition to proving new and stronger positive results than those previously available, we identify the significance of online updating and potential hazards associated with the use of nonlinear function approximators. First, we prove that divergence may occur when updates are not based on trajectories of the Markov chain. This fact reconciles positive and negative results that have been discussed in the literature, regarding the soundness of temporal-difference learning. Second, we present an example illustrating the possibility of divergence when temporal difference learning is used in the presence of a nonlinear function approximator.","doi":"10.1109/9.580874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/12616/00580874.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.580874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of temporal-difference learning with function approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of temporal-difference learning with function approximation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580874/","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5587726","volume":"42","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of temporal-difference learning with function approximation","sourcePdf":"00580874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031849S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"475","articleId":"580874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":580875,"authors":[{"name":"Gyung-Leen Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Gyung-Leen Park","id":"37614215800"},{"name":"B.

The uncertainties are assumed to be bounded by an unknown pth-order polynomial in the outputs. The resulting controller maintains global robustness and disturbance rejection properties. The output tracking error is shown to be bounded within a compact set, the size of which can be made arbitrarily small by appropriate choice of the control gains.

One of the earliest parallel sorting algorithms is bitonic sort, which is represented by a sorting network consisting of multiple butterfly stages. The paper studies bitonic sort on modern parallel machines which are relatively coarse grained and consist of only a modest number of nodes, thus requiring the mapping of many data elements to each processor. Under such a setting optimizing the bitonic sort algorithm becomes a question of mapping the data elements to processing nodes (data layout) such that communication is minimized. The authors developed a bitonic sort algorithm which minimizes the number of communication steps and optimizes the local computation. The resulting algorithm is faster than previous implementations, as experimental results collected on a 64 node Meiko CS-2 show.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 11th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4440/12600/00580914.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"309","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 11th International Parallel Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1997.580914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1997.580914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12600","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=580914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing parallel bitonic sort","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Application software","Concurrent computing","Parallel algorithms","Computer science","Modems","Parallel machines","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer networks","Phase change random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting","parallel machines","parallel algorithms","optimisation","communication complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized parallel bitonic sort algorithm","parallel sorting algorithms","sorting network","multiple butterfly stages","coarse-grained parallel machines","data element mapping","processing nodes","communication steps","local computation","Meiko CS-2"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing parallel bitonic sort","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5566833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing parallel bitonic sort","confLoc":"Genva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00580914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030992S","chronDate":"1-5 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4440","citationCount":"21","articleId":"580914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":580922,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

The algorithms can handle any type of loop-carried dependencies. They follow the INSPECTOR/EXECUTOR scheme and improve upon previous algorithms with the same generality by allowing concurrent reads of the same location and by increasing the overlap of dependent iterations. The algorithms are based on time-stamping rules and implemented using multithreading tools. The experimental results on an SMP server with four processors show that our schemes are efficient and outperform their competitors consistently in all test cases. The difference between the two proposed algorithms is that one allows partially concurrent reads without causing extra overhead in its inspector while the other allows fully concurrent reads at a slight overhead in the dependence analysis. The algorithm allowing fully concurrent reads obtains up to an 80% improvement over its competitor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1997.580939","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 11th International Parallel Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 11th International Parallel Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4440/12600/00580939.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"450","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1997.580939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-stamping algorithms for parallelization of loops at run-time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Time-stamping algorithms for parallelization of loops at run-time","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 April 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5559812","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/580939/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-stamping algorithms for parallelization of loops at run-time","confLoc":"Genva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00580939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032828S","chronDate":"1-5 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4440","citationCount":"3","articleId":"580939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":580977,"authors":[{"name":"D.

By this, firm contacts on 2,756 bond pads provided on a 6\" diameter wafer are made in a temperature range from room to 125/spl deg/C. In order to establish the contacts, a polyimide membrane with nickel bumps (ASMAT/sup (R/) manufactured by Nitto Denko Corp.) is used The polyimide membrane is fixed on a ring of ceramic having a thermal expansion coefficient similar to the silicon substrate so the entire membrane tracks the silicon during thermal changes. The other feature is the use of localized pressure-sensitive conductive rubber (PCR/sup TM/ manufactured by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co. Ltd.) establishing connections between the bumps provided on the polyimide membrane and the wiring substrate. The atmospheric pressure in the space between the bumps and the wafer is decreased in order to apply a uniform pressure in-between. By this, problems such as the thermal expansion difference and the thermal shrinkage of polyimide membrane are solved simultaneously. In addition to these, problems of the deviations of bump heights (/spl plusmn/3 /spl mu/m) and the warp of the wiring substrate (/spl plusmn/6 /spl mu/m) are solved by the use of localized pressure sensitive conductive rubber. This leads to a realization of a cost effective and reliable WLBI.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Apr 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5665101","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 1997","displayDocTitle":"A wafer-level burn-in technology using the contactor controlled thermal expansion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wafer-level burn-in technology using the contactor controlled thermal expansion","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00581186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039967S","chronDate":"2-4 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437","citationCount":"4","articleId":"581186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":581268,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The effect of various design parameters like bump geometry, \"soft\" and \"hard\" underfill, and used solder mask on the thermal fatigue life of solder joints is discussed. Since special attention has been directed towards Flip Chip on Board (FCOB) assemblies, constitutive properties of polymeric and solder materials are discussed in detail. The solder is modeled using a nonlinear constitutive law with time dependent (creep) and time independent plastic strains. Furthermore, material testing shows that the underfill and solder mask materials might be considered as linear viscoelastic with temperature time shift properties. Thermal mismatch between the materials assembled is often the main reason for thermally induced stresses. Thermal cycling (125/spl deg/C...-55/spl deg/C...125/spl deg/C) is therefore the load generally used in the 3D non-linear finite element analysis. Calculation results of the solder bump deformation due to temperature changes are accompanied by experimental deformation analysis. The used MicroDAC method is based on algorithms of local object tracking in images obtained from electron scanning microscopy. The measured deformation fields were utilized for proper materials selection and processing, as well as for verification of finite element analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Materials mechanics and mechanical reliability of flip chip assemblies on organic substrates","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 3rd International Symposium on Advanced Packaging Materials Processes, Properties and Interfaces","doi":"10.1109/ISAPM.1997.581268","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 3rd International Symposium on Advanced Packaging Materials Processes, Properties and Interfaces","pdfPath":"/iel3/4447/12612/00581268.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPM.1997.581268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Materials mechanics and mechanical reliability of flip chip assemblies on organic substrates","conferenceDate":"9-12 March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658124","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Materials mechanics and mechanical reliability of flip chip assemblies on organic substrates","confLoc":"Braselton, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00581268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047285S","chronDate":"9-12 Mar 1997","isNumber":"12612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447","citationCount":"26","articleId":"581268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":581312,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

The existing algorithms of dynamic slice computation use data and control dependencies to compute dynamic slices. These algorithms are limited to structured programs because they may compute incorrect dynamic slices for unstructured programs, due to the limitations of control dependencies that are used to compute dynamic slices. In this paper, we present a novel approach to dynamic slice computation for unstructured programs. The approach employs the notion of a removable block in finding dynamic program slices. Dynamic slices are derived by identifying not only those parts of program execution that contribute to the computation of the value of a variable of interest, but also those parts of program execution that do not contribute to the computation of the variable value. Data dependencies are used to identify contributing computations, whereas removable blocks are used to identify noncontributing computations.

In this article, a simple procedure for designing finite-extent impulse response (FIR) discrete-time filters using the FFT algorithm is described. The zero-phase (or linear phase) FIR filter design problem is formulated to alternately satisfy the frequency domain constraints on the magnitude response bounds and time domain constraints on the impulse response support. The design scheme is iterative in which each iteration requires two FFT computations. The resultant filter is an equiripple approximation to the desired frequency response. The main advantage of the FFT-based design method is its implementational simplicity and versatility. Furthermore, the way the algorithm works is intuitive and any additional constraint can be incorporated in the iterations, as long as the convexity property of the overall operations is preserved. In one-dimensional cases, the most widely used equiripple FIR filter design algorithm is the Parks-McClellan algorithm (1972). This algorithm is based on linear programming, and it is computationally efficient. However, it cannot be generalized to higher dimensions. Extension of our design method to higher dimensions is straightforward. In this case two multidimensional FFT computations are needed in each iteration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/12571/00581378.pdf","doi":"10.1109/79.581378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.581378","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equiripple FIR filter design by the FFT algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581378/","displayDocTitle":"Equiripple FIR filter design by the FFT algorithm","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5550428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equiripple FIR filter design by the FFT algorithm","sourcePdf":"00581378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088436S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"64","articleId":"581378","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":581413,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Subtask data relocation is defined as selecting the sources for their needed data items. This study focuses on theoretical issues for data relocation using a stochastic HC model. It is assumed that multiple independent subtasks of an application program can be executed concurrently on different machines whenever possible. A stochastic model for HC is proposed, in which the computation times of subtasks and communication times for inter-machine data transfers can be random variables. The optimization problem for finding the optimal matching, scheduling, and data relocation schemes to minimize the total execution time of an application program is defined based on this stochastic HC model. The optimization criteria and search space for the above optimization problem are described. It is proven that a greedy algorithm based approach will generate the optimal data relocation scheme with respect to any fixed matching and scheduling schemes. This result indicates that a greedy algorithm based approach is the best strategy for developing data relocation heuristics in practice.","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1997.581415","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth Heterogeneous Computing Workshop (HCW'97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth Heterogeneous Computing Workshop (HCW'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4432/12573/00581415.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HCW.1997.581415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic model of a dedicated heterogeneous computing system for establishing a greedy approach to developing data relocation heuristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic model of a dedicated heterogeneous computing system for establishing a greedy approach to developing data relocation heuristics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5559740","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-1 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic model of a dedicated heterogeneous computing system for establishing a greedy approach to developing data relocation heuristics","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00581415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033238S","chronDate":"1 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4432","citationCount":"2","articleId":"581415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":581416,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For achieving a fast response time from such systems, an efficient assignment of the application tasks to the processors is imperative. The general assignment problem is known to be NP-hard, except in a few special cases with strict assumptions. While a large number of heuristic techniques have been suggested in the literature that can yield sub-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time, we aim to develop techniques for optimal solutions under relaxed assumptions. The basis of our research is a best-first search technique known as the A* algorithm from the area of artificial intelligence. The original search technique guarantees an optimal solution but is not feasible for problems of practically large sizes due to its high time and space complexity. We propose a number of algorithms based around the A* technique. The proposed algorithms also yield optimal solutions but are considerably faster. The first algorithm solves the assignment problem by using parallel processing. Parallelizing the assignment algorithm is a natural way to lower the time complexity, and we believe our algorithm to be novel in this regard. The second algorithm is based on a clustering based pre-processing technique that merges the high affinity tasks. Clustering reduces the problem size, which in turn reduces the state-space for the assignment algorithm. We also propose three heuristics which do not guarantee optimal solutions but provide near-optimal solutions and are considerably faster. By using our parallel formulation, the proposed clustering technique and the heuristics can also be parallelized to further improve their time complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1 Apr 1997","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"1-1 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5559741","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal task assignment in heterogeneous computing systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal task assignment in heterogeneous computing systems","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"00581416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033855S","chronDate":"1 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4432","citationCount":"14","articleId":"581416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":581418,"authors":[{"name":"G.O.

A mathematical model for the communication network: that interconnects the machines of the HC system is introduced and a probabilistic approach is developed to estimate the overall execution time distribution of the task graph. It is shown that, for a given matching and scheduling, computing the exact distribution of the overall execution time of a task graph is very difficult, and thus impractical. The proposed approach approximates the exact distribution and requires a relatively small amount of calculation time. The accuracy of the proposed approach is demonstrated mathematically through the derivation of bounds that quantify the difference between the exact distribution and that provided by the proposed approach.

In particular the enabling functions and rate functions used to specify the SPN model provide needed versatility to integrate processor heterogeneity, task priorities, allocation schemes, communication costs, and other factors characteristic of a HCS into a comprehensive performance analysis. The manner in which these parameters are incorporated into the SPN allows the model to be transformed into a testbed for optimization schemes and heuristics.

A system suck as this should also be fault tolerant and include the capability for redundancy. These goals can be met by paralleling together smaller inverters if a control scheme can be designed to allow them to operate independently yet still share the load. We have developed a control technique for operating two or more single phase inverter modules in parallel with no auxiliary interconnections. This technique uses frequency, fundamental voltage, and harmonic voltage droop to allow independent inverters to share the load in proportion to their capacities.

To accomplish this, voltage source inverters (VSI) now employ third generation insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); however, the fast rise times associated with these devices produce unintended consequences. This paper examines motor overvoltages resulting from IGBT PWM VSI. Previous investigations have shown a critical power cable distance exists beyond which twice bus voltage (2 pu) terminal voltages are possible. This is determined primarily by the rise time of the devices and cable characteristics. This paper investigates motor voltages >2 pu, their cause and solution. In contrast to motor voltages /spl ges/2 pu, the paper shows motor voltages >2 pu primarily are determined by the PWM carrier frequency and modulation strategy. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates motor voltages up to 3-4 pu are possible. Software modifications to the PWM modulator and modulating signal are presented to reduce >2 pu motor overvoltage. Additionally, a hardware correction, easily implemented within a field programmable gate array (FPGA), is disclosed and experimentally demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1997.581440","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4379/12569/00581440.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"113 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1997.581440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12569","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PWM inverters and their influence on motor overvoltage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PWM inverters and their influence on motor overvoltage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5595748","conferenceDate":"27-27 Feb. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PWM inverters and their influence on motor overvoltage","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00581440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040116S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379","citationCount":"31","articleId":"581440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":581442,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Jun Kim","affiliation":["Machine Tool Engineering Department, Hyundai Precision and Industrial Company Limited, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Jun Kim","id":"37087184247"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37086965531"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3704-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"581442","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":653},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Pulse width modulation inverters","AC motors","Inductance","Matched filters","Induction motors","Impedance","Surges","Frequency","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","DC-AC power convertors","power filters","overvoltage","power system transients","AC motors","machine theory","transient analysis","machine testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage-fed PWM inverter","power filter design","high voltage gradient suppression","inverter terminal","PWM waveform","AC motor terminals","computer simulation","experiments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581442","abstract":"This paper proposes a new filter topology that suppresses the high voltage gradient (dv/dt) in AC motor terminals when a cable feeding a motor is very long.

In addition, this proposed clamping circuit also provides a mechanism to reset the magnetizing current of the output transformer of SSIPP employing a forward converter as the output stage.

Regulation of the DC link current can be achieved by either phase shifting the gating pattern or varying the modulation index. Both of these methods however, result in unacceptably low values of input displacement factor (IDF) for light loads. A control strategy based on combining modulation index and phase shift control is proposed in this paper to achieve near unity IDF for a wide range of operating points. The paper includes a description of the proposed control strategy, investigation of IDF compensation limitations, and simulation and experimental results for various modes of operation. The paper also investigates the IDF values for the above three control strategies and for three different types of industrial loads. Results show that depending on the speed/torque characteristics of the load, a power factor correction system may not always be necessary for CSI based drives with PWM rectifier front end.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1997.581471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1997.581471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12569","startPage":"327","endPage":"332 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4379/12569/00581471.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of APEC 97 - Applied Power Electronics Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581471","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Rectifiers","Medium voltage","Drives","Switching frequency","Power harmonic filters","Capacitors","Thyristors","Size control","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motor drives","invertors","PWM power convertors","rectifying circuits","switching circuits","phase control","harmonics","electric current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near unity input displacement factor","medium voltage CSI based AC drives","current source rectifier","selective harmonic elimination","low switching frequencies","input harmonic requirements","modulation index","input displacement factor","light loads","phase shift control","industrial loads","speed/torque characteristics","power factor correction","PWM rectifier","300 to 420 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A near unity input displacement factor PWM rectifier for medium voltage CSI based AC drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"27-27 Feb. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5591292","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581471/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A near unity input displacement factor PWM rectifier for medium voltage CSI based AC drives","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00581471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030052S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1997","isNumber":"12569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379","citationCount":"5","articleId":"581471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":581507,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We introduce three new metrics for memory references: the Access Scatter Function, the Block Execution Interval, and the Local Execution Intervals. These new metrics and basic block sizes, branch distances, execution intervals, and the Stack Growth Function are used to characterize each sample. Then, samples are clustered to select representative samples.

This situation provides the motivation for efficient robust design of VLSI circuits. A method is proposed which generates a modular neural network MANN for mapping process level parameters to circuit performance. The MANN-an adaptive mixture of local experts competing to learn different aspects of a problem-is employed in performing extremely efficient optimization of the circuit yield at minimal cost. The MANN calculates circuit performance and optimizes yield with 97% accuracy at 20% of the cost of a full SPICE simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581646/","accessionNumber":"5540860","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-11 March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal transistor sizing for CMOS VLSI circuits using modular artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal transistor sizing for CMOS VLSI circuits using modular artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Cookeville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"00581646.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04509S","chronDate":"9-11 Mar 1997","isNumber":"12607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444","citationCount":"3","articleId":"581646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":581648,"authors":[{"name":"A.

With the rapid growth of the World Wide Web, semi-structured hierarchical data sources are becoming widely available to the casual user.

In view of their application in fiber optical switches the mirror height is 75 /spl mu/m. So the mirror covers well the fiber core of a single mode fiber, when the fiber is placed in a groove of the same depth and etched at the same time as the mirror. A minimal mirror thickness of 2.3 /spl mu/m was achieved, resulting in an aspect ratio over thirty. The verticality was better than 89.3/spl deg/. The surface roughness of the etched surface is 36 nm rms. For an increased reflectivity the silicon mirrors are coated with aluminium. Their reflectivity was measured to be 76%. To obtain an uniform etch depth, etching is stopped on a buried oxide layer. This allows to integrate at the same time mirrors with suspension and actuation structures as well as fiber-alignment grooves in one processing step. Using this technology we have fabricated a fiber optical switch with promising performance: The coupling loss in the OFF position is 2.5 dB and 4 dB in the ON position. The switching time is below 0.2 ms.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE The Tenth Annual International Workshop on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems.

These components are fabricated on planar substrates using a simple three mask, low-temperature, IC compatible process that allows the integration of microfluidic and circuit elements. The microfluidic elements are conformal to the substrate thus overcoming the planarization required by bonded structures. In addition they have relatively large volumes in contrast to polysilicon based devices and are completely sealed in a batch manner overcoming the limitations of micromoulding. The capillaries are also optically transparent and can range from 0.5 /spl mu/m to 100 /spl mu/m in height. The fluidic components have been fabricated on top of regular silicon, glass, and polycarbonate wafers.

The results of 48 tests on five different sets of MUMPs specimens yield the following material properties: Young's modulus=169/spl plusmn/6.15 GPa, Poisson's ratio=0.22/spl plusmn/0.011, and tensile strength=1.20/spl plusmn/0.15 GPa These values have a reasonably low coefficient of variation which demonstrates the consistency of both the processing and the measurement techniques.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1997.581881","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE The Tenth Annual International Workshop on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems.

First, it must provide low latency retrieval of very large volumes of spatio temporal data. This requires effective declustering and placement of a multidimensional dataset onto a large disk farm. Second, the order of magnitude reduction in data size due to post processing makes it imperative, from a performance perspective, that the post processing be done on the machine that holds the data. This requires careful coordination of computation and data retrieval. The paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of Titan, a parallel shared nothing database designed for handling remote sensing data. The computational platform for Titan is a 16 processor IBM SP-2 with four fast disks attached to each processor. Titan is currently operational and contains about 24 GB of AVHRR data from the NOAA-7 satellite. The experimental results show that Titan provides good performance for global queries and interactive response times for local queries.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Apr 1997","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5566875","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Titan: a high-performance remote-sensing database","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Titan: a high-performance remote-sensing database","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"00581883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053169S","chronDate":"7-11 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4453","citationCount":"61","articleId":"581883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":581906,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The important aspect here is the introduction of the new expression Shall (elementary unit within a specification) plus a representation of the shall-centered approach to the development of prototypes, test procedures, and the reuse of solutions already devised.

SU-8 is an epoxy-based resist designed specifically for ultrathick, high-aspect-ratio MEMS-type applications. We have demonstrated that with single-layer coatings, thicknesses of more than 500 /spl mu/m can be achieved reproducibly. Thicker resist layers can be made by multiple coatings, and we have achieved exposures in 1200-/spl mu/m-thick, double coated SU-8 resist layers. We have found that the aspect ratio for near-UV (400 nm) exposed and developed structures can be greater than 18 and remains constant in the thickness range between 80 and 1200 /spl mu/m. Vertical sidewall profiles result in good dimensional control over the entire resist thickness. To our knowledge, this is the highest aspect ratio reported for near-UV exposures and resist thicknesses. These results will open up new possibilities for low-cost LIGA-type processes for MEMS applications. In addition, the SU-8 material has interesting mechanical properties which also makes it attractive for photoplastic device fabrication.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1997.581916","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE The Tenth Annual International Workshop on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems.

A parallel-cascade, nonlinear system identification technique was used to separate overall stiffness into intrinsic and reflex components. Intrinsic stiffness was described by a linear, second-order system similar to that demonstrated previously. Reflex stiffness dynamics were more complex, comprising a delay, a unidirectional rate-sensitive element and then lowpass dynamics. Reflex mechanisms were found to be most important at frequencies of 5-10 Hz. The gain and dynamics of reflex stiffness varied strongly with the parameters of the perturbation, the gain decreasing as the mean velocity of the perturbation increased. Under some conditions, torques generated by reflex mechanisms were of the same magnitude as those from intrinsic mechanisms. It is concluded that reflex stiffness can be large enough to be important functionally, but that its effects will depend strongly upon the particular conditions.","doi":"10.1109/10.581944","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"493","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/12629/00581944.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.581944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of intrinsic and reflex contributions to human ankle stiffness dynamics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Muscles","Deafness","System identification","Delay","Frequency","Electromyography","Legged locomotion","Biomedical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elasticity","biomechanics","neurophysiology","muscle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflex contributions","intrinsic contributions","human ankle stiffness dynamics","position perturbations","parallel-cascade nonlinear system identification technique","unidirectional rate-sensitive element","lowpass dynamics","perturbation parameters","reflex mechanisms","ankle biomechanics","5 to 10 Hz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Ankle Joint","Elasticity","Electromyography","Humans","Least-Squares Analysis","Linear Models","Male","Muscle Contraction","Predictive Value of Tests","Reference Values","Reflex, Stretch","Reproducibility of Results","Supine Position"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"Identification of intrinsic and reflex contributions to human ankle stiffness dynamics","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5580400","pubMedId":"9151483","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581944/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of intrinsic and reflex contributions to human ankle stiffness dynamics","sourcePdf":"00581944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048791S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"291","articleId":"581944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":581964,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Among other drawbacks, these standard methods do not preserve full polarimetric data, or they do not use the a priori texture distribution, or they are restricted to one look data. In the simplified case of data satisfying the so-called \"product model\", new optimal techniques are described in this paper that are able to reduce speckle effects on multilook data, while preserving fully polarimetric information and texture variations. This \"product model\" is valid when the scene texture has a large scale of variation and is polarization independent, for instance in K-distributed clutter. Under this assumption, the measured covariance matrix (multilook data) is the product of a scalar random variable /spl mu/ (the texture) and the covariance matrix C/sub zh/ of an equivalent Gaussian homogeneous surface. C/sub zh/ is the mean covariance matrix and contains the polarimetric information. A PWF for multilook complex data (MPWF) is proposed and is shown to be related to optimal statistical estimators of the texture (Maximum Likelihood, Maximum A Posteriori, MMSE...) when the complex Wishart distribution is used. The ML estimation of C/sub zh/ for textured areas is given and the adaptive filters based on these new tools are described. The results indicate a large speckle reduction. Moreover, the mean values of polarimetric features such as the magnitude and the phase of the HH-VV complex degree of coherence are preserved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/12630/00581979.pdf","startPage":"632","endPage":"647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.581979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.581979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal speckle reduction for the product model in multilook polarimetric SAR imagery and the Wishart distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Covariance matrix","Nonlinear filters","Maximum likelihood estimation","Mean square error methods","Vectors","Layout","Large-scale systems","Polarization","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","radar imaging","speckle","radar polarimetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","radar remote sensing","land surface","terrain mapping","optimal speckle reduction","product model","multilook polarimetric SAR imagery","radar polarimetry","synthetic aperture radar","Wishart distribution","texture distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimal speckle reduction for the product model in multilook polarimetric SAR imagery and the Wishart distribution","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5598649","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal speckle reduction for the product model in multilook polarimetric SAR imagery and the Wishart distribution","sourcePdf":"00581979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044641S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"83","articleId":"581979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":581981,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

One of the parameters of this special case is related to the degree of homogeneity, and a limiting case is that of a scaled speckle.

This paper presents a fast algorithm for generating coherence maps, mainly intended for data browsing. The proposed estimator is based on the speckle similarity of coherent SAR data, and is thus independent of fringe frequency. The following advantages, with respect to the usual estimates, are achieved: (a) The estimator is more than 100 times faster, achieved at the cost of a reduced statistical confidence. (b) The estimator is not affected by possible local frequency estimation errors. (c) The estimator can be directly applied to single look detected images. The theoretical derivation of the statistical properties of the frequency independent estimator is carried out in the stationary case. The nonstationary case is then analyzed on real ERS SAR images.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/12630/00581984.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.581984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.581984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR interferometry: a \"Quick and dirty\" coherence estimator for data browsing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interferometry","Frequency estimation","Pixel","Costs","Phase estimation","Speckle","Image analysis","Satellites","Image registration","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical signal processing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","radar imaging","speckle","spaceborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","land surface","terrain mapping","radar imaging","radar remote sensing","quick method","SAR interferometry","synthetic aperture radar","coherence estimator","data browsing","fast algorithm","coherence map","speckle similarity","ERS","spaceborne radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"SAR interferometry: a \"Quick and dirty\" coherence estimator for data browsing","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5598651","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR interferometry: a \"Quick and dirty\" coherence estimator for data browsing","sourcePdf":"00581984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028586S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"62","articleId":"581984","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":581987,"authors":[{"name":"E.F.

This paper presents 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), a computer code which can accurately simulate the above problems. The 6S code is an improved version of 5S (Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), developed by the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique ten years ago. The new version now permits calculations of near-nadir (down-looking) aircraft observations, accounting for target elevation, non lambertian surface conditions, and new absorbing species (CH/sub 4/, N/sub 2/O, CO). The computational accuracy for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering effects has been improved by the use of state-of-the-art approximations and implementation of the successive order of scattering (SOS) algorithm. The step size (resolution) used for spectral integration has been improved to 2.5 nm. The goal of this paper is not to provide a complete description of the methods used as that information is detailed in the 6S manual, but rather to illustrate the impact of the improvements between 5S and 6S by examining some typical remote sensing situations. Nevertheless, the 6S code has still limitations. It cannot handle spherical atmosphere and as a result, it cannot be used for limb observations. In addition, the decoupling the authors are using for absorption and scattering effects does not allow to use the code in presence of strong absorption bands.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/12630/00581987.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.581987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.581987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum, 6S: an overview","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Atmospheric modeling","Sea surface","Computational modeling","Rayleigh scattering","Remote sensing","Land surface","Infrared sensors","Atmosphere","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","oceanographic techniques","remote sensing","atmospheric optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","land surface","terrain mapping","optical imaging","atmosphere optics","light propagation","satellite remote sensing","Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum","6S","airborne remote sensing","near infrared","visible region","sea surface","ocean","model","computer code","near-nadir","target elevation","nonlambertian surface conditions","aerosol scattering","successive order of scattering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/581987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum, 6S: an overview","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5598653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum, 6S: an overview","sourcePdf":"00581987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033984S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"1857","articleId":"581987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":581990,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In the second method, a new multistage multilayer feedforward architecture is used for the classification of the waveforms and for the extraction of various types of ocean information. The stage I networks work in a parallel fashion and map the input waveforms to a set of characteristics. The networks in stage II use these characteristics to assign a signature number to the waveform or extract other information.

This paper also compares the performances of two different methods, using the same data set for meaningful comparison. The advantages of FAM are: (1) expert knowledge acquired by geologists is fully utilized; (2) this knowledge is augmented by the neural network learning from the data, when available; and (3) FAM is \"transparent\" in that the knowledge is explicitly stated in the fuzzy rules.","doi":"10.1109/36.582000","startPage":"773","endPage":"780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.582000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12630","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/12630/00582000.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lithology determination from well logs with fuzzy associative memory neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582000/","displayDocTitle":"Lithology determination from well logs with fuzzy associative memory neural network","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5598662","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lithology determination from well logs with fuzzy associative memory neural network","sourcePdf":"00582000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034402S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"29","articleId":"582000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":582002,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This corpus was collected in 1987, although it was not published until 1990. The advances with compression algorithms have been achieving relatively small improvements in compression, measured using the Calgary corpus. There is a concern that algorithms are being fine-tuned to this corpus, and that small improvements measured in this way may not apply to other files. Furthermore, the corpus is almost ten years old, and over this period there have been changes in the kinds of files that are compressed, particularly with the development of the Internet, and the rapid growth of high-capacity secondary storage for personal computers. We explore the issues raised above, and develop a principled technique for collecting a corpus of test data for compression methods. A corpus, called the Canterbury corpus, is developed using this technique, and we report the performance of a collection of compression methods using the new corpus.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582019/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5665137","conferenceDate":"25-27 March 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A corpus for the evaluation of lossless compression algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A corpus for the evaluation of lossless compression algorithms","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00582019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050442S","chronDate":"25-27 Mar 1997","isNumber":"12634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456","citationCount":"73","articleId":"582019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582045,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

Specifically, we model image wavelet coefficients as being drawn from an independent generalized Gaussian distribution field, of fixed unknown shape for each subband, having zero mean and unknown slowly spatially-varying variances. Based on this model, we develop a powerful \"on the fly\" estimation-quantization (EQ) framework that consists of: (i) first finding the maximum-likelihood estimate of the individual spatially-varying coefficient field variances based on causal and quantized spatial neighborhood contexts; and (ii) then applying an off-line rate-distortion (R-D) optimized quantization/entropy coding strategy, implemented as a fast lookup table, that is optimally matched to the derived variance estimates. A distinctive feature of our paradigm is the dynamic switching between forward and backward adaptation modes based on the reliability of causal prediction contexts. The performance of our coder is extremely competitive with the best published results in the literature across diverse classes of images and target bitrates of interest, in both compression efficiency and processing speed. For example, our coder exceeds the objective performance of the best zerotree-based wavelet coder based on space-frequency-quantization at all bit rates for all tested images at a fraction of its complexity.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582045","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet coefficients","Bit rate","Image representation","Gaussian distribution","Shape","Context modeling","Maximum likelihood estimation","Rate-distortion","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image representation","data compression","transform coding","wavelet transforms","Gaussian distribution","maximum likelihood estimation","quantisation (signal)","rate distortion theory","table lookup","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","mixture modeling","wavelet coefficients","fast estimation-quantization","compression efficiency","infinite mixture model","space-frequency characterization","wavelet image representation","image wavelet coefficients","independent generalized Gaussian distribution field","zero mean","slowly spatially-varying variances","maximum-likelihood estimate","quantized spatial neighborhood context","processing speed","offline rate-distortion","optimized quantization/entropy coding","fast lookup table","forward adaptation mode","backward adaptation mode","causal prediction contexts","coder performance"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '97.

We use a simple uniform scalar quantizer to quantize the image subbands. Our algorithm puts the coefficient into one of several classes depending on the values of neighboring previously quantized coefficients. These previously quantized coefficients form contexts which are used to characterize the subband data. To each context type corresponds a different probability model and thus each subband coefficient is compressed with an arithmetic coder having the appropriate model depending on that coefficient's neighborhood. We show how the context selection can be driven by rate-distortion criteria, by choosing the contexts in a way that the total distortion for a given bit rate is minimized. Moreover the probability models for each context are initialized/updated in a very efficient way so that practically no overhead information has to be sent to the decoder. Our results are comparable or in some cases better than the recent state of the art, with our algorithm being simpler than most of the published algorithms of comparable performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '97.

Introduces a new transformation for block-sorting data compression methods. The transformation is similar to the one presented by Burrows and Wheeler, but avoids the drawbacks of uncertain runtime and low performance with large blocks. The cost is a small compression loss and a slower back transformation. In addition to that it is well suited for hardware implementation. Typical applications include real-time data recording, fast communication lines, on the fly compression and any other task requiring high throughput. The difference between this transformation and the original block-sort transformation is that the original transformation sorts on unlimited context, whereas this transformation sorts on limited context (typically a few bytes) and uses the position in the input block to determine the sort order in the case of equal contexts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast block-sorting algorithm for lossless data compression","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC '97.

In addition to a data cache that interfaces with slower off-chip memory, a fast on-chip SRAM, called Scratch-Pad memory, is often used in several applications. We present a technique for efficiently exploiting on-chip Scratch-Pad memory by partitioning the application's scalar and array variables into off-chip DRAM and on-chip Scratch-Pad SRAM, with the goal of minimizing the total execution time of embedded applications. Our experiments on code kernels from typical applications show that our technique results in significant performance improvements.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings European Design and Test Conference.

In a genetic optimization procedure, the crossover operator accepts two test patterns t/sub 1/ and t/sub 2/, and randomly copies parts of t/sub 1/ and parts of t/sub 2/ into one or more new test patterns. Such a procedure does not take advantage of circuit properties that may aid in generating more effective test patterns. In this work, we propose a representation of test patterns where subsets of inputs are considered as indivisible entities. Using this representation, crossover copies all the values of each subset either from t/sub 1/ or from t/sub 2/. By keeping input subsets undivided, activation and propagation capabilities of t/sub 1/ and t/sub 2/ are captured and carried over to the new test patterns. The effectiveness of this scheme is demonstrated by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/EDTC.1997.582408","pdfPath":"/iel3/4452/12625/00582408.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"511","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings European Design and Test Conference.

Compared with other approaches, no special tools or modeling languages are needed-instead the models and tools of the ASIC design flow are used. The architecture trade-off process is performed iteratively, and considers information from different levels of abstraction in parallel. At system level, software and behavioral models, which are part of executable specifications are examined to get the necessary top-down information (performance). Bottom-up information (hardware costs) for irregular hardware structures is obtained by generating, analyzing and synthesizing VHDL code at RT-Level. For regular structures, formulas or tables can be used to estimate area and timing. The proposed approach was successfully performed for parts of a multimedia design, where an executable specification (in 'C') was available together with the standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology for hardware architecture trade-off at different levels of abstraction","publicationTitle":"Proceedings European Design and Test Conference.

However, the applicability of this approach is restricted by several practical limitations: typical power systems are represented by very large state matrices that require specialized large-scale eigen analysis programs; the program where the power system models reside does not include linearization capabilities; only time domain data is available. This article illustrates the applicability of a new system identification software program, SYSID, developed to circumvent these limitations. The program incorporates several identification techniques that allow for the computation of equivalent linear models, suitable for control design applications, from time domain simulation data. The program has been used to calculate equivalent models from simulations performed with standard stability programs, as well as from the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) simulations of detailed three-phase power systems. The equivalent systems are small and retain the modal characteristics of the original system. The identification techniques are based on various algorithms including Prony's method, transfer function fitting, and Hankel matrices. In addition to the identification algorithms, the program also includes signal processing, plotting, modal analysis functions, and basic control design capabilities to assess closed loop system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582448/","volume":"10","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5556137","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Identifying linear models from time domain simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying linear models from time domain simulations","sourcePdf":"00582448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061631S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"18","articleId":"582448","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582451,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) implemented in a computer-based motor monitor can contribute to such condition-based maintenance functions. Such a system may also detect an abnormality in the process as well as the motor. Extensive online monitoring of the motors can lead to greater plant availability, extended plant life, higher quality product, and smoother plant operation. With advances in digital technology over the last several years, adequate data processing capability is now available on cost-effective, microprocessor-based, protective-relay platforms to monitor motors for a variety of abnormalities in addition to the normal protection functions. Such multifunction monitors, are displacing the multiplicity of electromechanical devices commonly applied for many years. Following some background information on motor monitoring, this article features recent developments in providing tools for the diagnosis of faults or incipient faults in electric motor drives, including: sensorless torque measurement; direct detection of turn-to-turn short circuits; detection of cracked or broken rotor bars; and detection of bearing deterioration.","doi":"10.1109/67.582451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel3/67/12623/00582451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.582451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12623","startPage":"39","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless, online motor diagnostics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless, online motor diagnostics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5556140","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless, online motor diagnostics","sourcePdf":"00582451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055575S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"61","articleId":"582451","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582461,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This paper proposes to control the time step size automatically within the program to save computing time substantially. It is shown that only simple formulae for estimating the local truncation errors at each timestep using backward Euler's method or Crank-Nicolson's method are all that are required to be derived. These formulae require no extra complicated computation. Hence the reported algorithm can be extended easily to many finite element investigations to more FEM a practical tool to industrial problems. The strategy in choosing the optimal step size is described. The proposed algorithm is then used to study the transient behaviour of an induction motor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/12599/00582511.pdf","startPage":"1370","endPage":"1373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.582511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.582511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of automatic choice of step size for time stepping finite element method to induction motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Equations","Finite wordlength effects","Torque","Computational modeling","Automatic control","Size control","Electromagnetic transients","Induction motors","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","machine theory","transient analysis","electric machine analysis computing","finite element analysis","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","transient behaviour modelling","time stepping finite element method","step size selection automation","CPU time","computing time","local truncation errors","backward Euler's method","Crank-Nicolson's method","algorithm","optimal step size","computer simulation","FEM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1997","displayDocTitle":"Application of automatic choice of step size for time stepping finite element method to induction motors","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5542640","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of automatic choice of step size for time stepping finite element method to induction motors","sourcePdf":"00582511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045883S","chronDate":"March  1997","isNumber":"12599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"23","articleId":"582511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":582521,"authors":[{"name":"Lezhu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"lastName":"Lezhu Zhou","id":"37346096400"},{"name":"L.E.

Numerical results indicate that the PML is by far superior to all other ABCs, especially when their layers, are implemented.

A potential advantage of the hybrid method compared to the genetic algorithm is that global optimization can be performed more efficiently. An intrinsic problem of the hybrid techniques is related to the moment of stopping the stochastic routine to launch the deterministic one. This is investigated using some natural criteria for the commutation between the two methods. The results show that it is possible to gain in efficiency and in accuracy but the criterion is usually problem dependent. Finally, to show the solution of a real problem, the hybrid algorithm is coupled to a 2D code based on the boundary element method to optimize a connector of 145 kV GIS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1997","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5548545","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm coupled with a deterministic method for optimization in electromagnetics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm coupled with a deterministic method for optimization in electromagnetics","sourcePdf":"00582645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032398S","chronDate":"March  1997","isNumber":"12599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"36","articleId":"582645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582651,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Joon Sim","affiliation":["Steel Process Div Electromagnetic Process Team, RIST, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Joon Sim","id":"37615171000"},{"name":"Dong-Hyeok Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Hyeok Cho","id":"37364821500"},{"name":"Jang-Sung Chun","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jang-Sung Chun","id":"37362788900"},{"name":"Hyun-Kyo Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyun-Kyo Jung","id":"37292316100"},{"name":"Tae-Kyoung Chung","affiliation":["Department of Elcctricdl Engineering, Choongang University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae-Kyoung Chung","id":"37857661300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"582651","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":683},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency optimization of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor using genetic algorithms","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/12599/00582651.pdf","startPage":"1880","endPage":"1883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.582651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12599","doi":"10.1109/20.582651","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Genetic algorithms","Synchronous motors","Genetic mutations","Design optimization","Finite element methods","Stochastic processes","Steel","Genetic engineering","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","machine theory","design engineering","genetic algorithms","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","optimal design method","efficiency optimization","genetic algorithms","objective function","design variables","performance prediction","air gap flux density","d, q axis inductances","FEM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582651","abstract":"This paper presents an optimal design method to maximize the efficiency of the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor.

This method is useful for nonlinear problems and model-building problems such as parameter determination.","doi":"10.1109/20.582668","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/12599/00582668.pdf","startPage":"1924","endPage":"1927","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.582668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of induction motor parameters by using neural network based on FEM results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1997","displayDocTitle":"Determination of induction motor parameters by using neural network based on FEM results","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5548561","publicationDate":"March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of induction motor parameters by using neural network based on FEM results","sourcePdf":"00582668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038796S","chronDate":"March  1997","isNumber":"12599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"12","articleId":"582668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":582669,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Qing","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Wu Qing","id":"37087308427"},{"name":"Shen Xueqin","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Shen Xueqin","id":"37088119013"},{"name":"Yang Qingxin","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yang Qingxin","id":"37087538990"},{"name":"Yan Weili","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yan Weili","id":"37087536415"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"582669","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Electromagnetic devices","Signal resolution","Wavelet transforms","Feedforward neural networks","Wavelet analysis","Electromagnetic modeling","Mathematical model","Time frequency analysis","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vacuum contactors","wavelet transforms","feedforward neural nets","optimisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","power engineering computing","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet neural networks","optimal design","electromagnetic devices","feedforward neural network","complex nonlinear functions","self-adaptive procedure","input/output maps learning","training sets","finite element analysis","learning speed","optimization design","AC vacuum contactor","DC exciting electrical circuit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582669","abstract":"A feedforward neural network based on the wavelet transform which can be applied to the approximation of complex nonlinear functions is discussed.

After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the different solutions, we give the results of the degradation of the performance of the block turbo decoder circuit due to data quantization.

The BER performance is obtained for a data rate of 8 kb/s with channel spacings of both 12.5 kHz and 6.25 kHz. These channel spacings and data rate correspond to those investigated by Levesque, Pizzi and Duncombe (1990) for a proposed standard for narrowband digital land mobile radio (Federal Standard 1024). For simulations in Rayleigh fading we examine RMS Doppler spreads, B/sub RMS/, up to 100 Hz. They show that DCQPSK-SRC is more sensitive to timing errors than GTFM. The adjacent channel interference (ACI) is characterized using the adjacent channel interference protection ratio (ACIPR). GTFM operating at 8 kb/s can achieve an ACIPR of 59 dB in a 12.5 kHz channel with nonlinear amplification. When linearly amplified, DCQPSK-SRC operating at 8 kb/s can achieve an ACIPR of 100 dB in a 12.5 kHz channel and 78 dB in a 6.25 kHz channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00582826.pdf","startPage":"1478","endPage":"1485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of generalized tamed-FM and differentially-coherent QPSK for land mobile radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Interchannel interference","AWGN","Protection","Rayleigh channels","Channel spacing","Filtering","Additive white noise","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio systems","frequency modulation","radiofrequency interference","phase shift keying","filtering and prediction theory","random noise","white noise","fading","digital radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized tamed-FM","differentially-coherent QPSK","Federal Standard 1024","bit error rate","BER performance","raised-cosine filtering","nonlinear amplification","square-root","DCQPSK-SRC","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","Rayleigh fading","data rate","channel spacings","narrowband digital land mobile radio","simulations","RMS Doppler spreads","timing errors","adjacent channel interference protection ratio","8 kbit/s","12.5 kHz","6.25 kHz","100 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of generalized tamed-FM and differentially-coherent QPSK for land mobile radio","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703056","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of generalized tamed-FM and differentially-coherent QPSK for land mobile radio","sourcePdf":"00582826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037461S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","articleId":"582826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":582830,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Such action requires a method for monitoring the channel state and detecting a change in it. The frequency of retransmission requests in ARQ and type-I hybrid-ARQ error control strategies provides a natural source of channel state information. The proposed scheme incorporates the retransmission requests into the scoring of a statistical sequential inspection scheme proposed by E. Page in 1954. Each transmitted packet is scored based on the outcome of the decoding process (i.e., whether it is accepted or rejected). When the cumulative score crosses a decision boundary, the coding strategy is altered and the sequential inspection scheme is restarted using the same scoring routine with different weighting and boundary constants. In this way the channel encoder/decoder is able to alter its strategy and adapt itself to changes in the channel. The analysis of this system is based on the average run length of the tests in the various channel states. These values indicate the delay the system experiences in reacting to a change in the channel and the tendency the test has to terminate prematurely. These factors are a function of the test constants which are determined algorithmatically by maximizing the system throughput using the system reliability as a constraint. Results show that the performance of this system is close to that of the ideal system with perfect channel state information.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00582836.pdf","startPage":"1533","endPage":"1543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sequential scheme for adaptive error control over slowly varying channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"A sequential scheme for adaptive error control over slowly varying channels","volume":"42","issue":"234","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703066","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequential scheme for adaptive error control over slowly varying channels","sourcePdf":"00582836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064776S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","articleId":"582836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":582838,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Harvey","affiliation":["Georgia Tech Research Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Harvey","id":"37273499900"},{"name":"S.B.

In this paper several packet combining schemes are presented for use in conjunction with the Viterbi decoder over stationary and time-varying channels. The first technique presented is an averaged diversity combiner, which is shown to be identical in performance to an interleaved code combiner over an AWGN channel. The averaged diversity combiner is then generalized to make use of packet weights based on either ideal channel state information or weights derived from side information generated by the Viterbi decoder. It is shown that the weighted diversity combiner using decoder side information performs almost as well as the system using ideal channel state information. All of the packet combining schemes discussed in this paper provide improved throughput and reliability performance relative to that provided by the standard type-I hybrid-ARQ or EEC systems. This performance improvement is obtained at the expense of negligible to moderate modifications to the transmitter and receiver. Performance bounds are derived for each of the combining schemes and their tightness verified through simulation results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582838/","volume":"42","issue":"234","accessionNumber":"4703067","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Packet combining systems based on the Viterbi decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet combining systems based on the Viterbi decoder","sourcePdf":"00582838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063462S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"88","articleId":"582838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582847,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The higher order cumulant statistics is exploited, in addition to the usual second-order statistics, of the data and of appropriately defined error signals. The proposed methods yield (globally) optimal solutions. The estimated channel impulse response can be used for channel equalization, either for reliable (\"open eye\") initialization of the conventional decision-directed equalizers or as a channel estimator for a Viterbi algorithm based equalizer.

State-of-the-art adaptive estimators employing decision feedback suffer from error propagation and limited robustness against faster fading. In this paper, the optimal feedforward channel estimator using only known training symbols is systematically derived. Statistical channel information is assumed to be available. For moderately rapid fading channels (snapshot assumption), the optimal estimator is shown to be divided into the two subtasks of maximum-likelihood acquisition and subsequent Wiener filtering of the acquired quantities. If perfect training sequences resulting in optimal performance are used, the Wiener filtering operation collapses into independent filtering of the individual acquired tap estimates, and the resulting channel estimator becomes efficient and flexible. The performance of the optimal estimator is evaluated for important cases. A design example of a near-optimal HF channel estimator/receiver is discussed. Linear interpolation is used to reduce the computational complexity of receiver coefficient adjustment. Simulation results confirm the superiority and robustness of feedforward synchronization having near-optimal performance at reduced complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00582864.pdf","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal parametric feedforward estimation of frequency-selective fading radio channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Wiener filter","Frequency synchronization","Robustness","Fading","Dispersion","Receivers","State estimation","State feedback","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","synchronisation","digital radio systems","parameter estimation","filtering and prediction theory","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal parametric feedforward estimation","frequency-selective fading radio channels","time-varying dispersive radio channels","receiver synchronisation","training symbols","statistical channel information","snapshot assumption","rapid fading channels","maximum-likelihood acquisition","subsequent Wiener filtering","training sequences","tap estimates","HF channel estimator","HF receiver","linear interpolation","computational complexity","receiver coefficient adjustment","simulation results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal parametric feedforward estimation of frequency-selective fading radio channels","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703076","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal parametric feedforward estimation of frequency-selective fading radio channels","sourcePdf":"00582864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052397S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"49","articleId":"582864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":582868,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A number of approximations are applied to this simplified parallel symbol (SPS) detector that lead to the derivation of suboptimal detectors. One such suboptimal detector is shown to be the same as the minimum-metric Viterbi detector. A brief comparison of the SPS detector and the Viterbi detector shows that the former has a slightly better performance at low values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the latter performs a smaller number of computations (particularly) at higher values of SNR; otherwise, the two detectors are comparable in performance and complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582868","startPage":"1661","endPage":"1671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00582868.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced complexity symbol detectors with parallel structure for ISI channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reduced complexity symbol detectors with parallel structure for ISI channels","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4703078","publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced complexity symbol detectors with parallel structure for ISI channels","sourcePdf":"00582868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115585S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"140","articleId":"582868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":582873,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

These kernel-based density estimators use the known properties of the impulsive noise densities to be estimated in their construction and, in so doing, yield estimates that closely approximate the true densities for small sample sizes. In fact, from an extensive small-sample-size simulation study, it is seen that the proposed nonparametric schemes significantly outperform the standard estimators, A method for comparing the L/sub 1/-performance of nonparametric and parametric-based density estimators is also derived in the paper.

The received signal in this multipoint-to-point channel is additively composed of white Gaussian noise and independently faded waveforms from a finite number of asynchronous users. The optimum sequence detector consists of a bank of single-user matched filters followed by a dynamic programming algorithm, has a demodulation complexity per symbol which is exponential in the number of users, and requires the knowledge of the system as well of the fading parameters. The decorrelating detector has a complexity which is polynomial in the number of users, and does not require knowledge of the signal amplitudes, which are assumed to vary slowly relative to the symbol rate. The single-user error rates are presented for both detectors and compared to conventional detection and isolated transmission, and the notion of asymptotic multiuser efficiency is developed for this channel. In contrast to conventional detection; which suffers from near-far effects due to Rayleigh fading, it is shown that the aforementioned multiuser detectors exhibit performance which rivals that of isolated transmission for sufficiently small thermal noise power. The results of the analysis are illustrated with numerical examples and indicate that the near-far problem may be alleviated by a more sophisticated receiver design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00582881.pdf","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detection in single-path fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582881/","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detection in single-path fading channels","volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703084","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detection in single-path fading channels","sourcePdf":"00582881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074621S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"93","articleId":"582881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582882,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

This is explained by the following observation: for independent flat-Rayleigh fading wireless systems with N mutually interfering users, they demonstrate that with K+N antennas, N-1 interferers can be nulled out and K+1 path diversity improvement can be achieved by each of the N users. Monte Carlo evaluations show that these results also hold with frequency-selective fading when optimum equalization is used at the receiver. Thus an N-fold increase in user capacity can be achieved, allowing for modular growth and improved performance by increasing the number of antennas. The interferers can also be users in other cells, users in other radio systems, or even other types of radiating devices, and thus interference cancellation also allows radio systems to operate in high interference environments. As an example of the potential system gain, the authors show that with 2 or 3 antennas the capacity of the mobile radio system IS-54 can be doubled, and with 5 antennas a 7-fold capacity increase (frequency reuse in every cell) can be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Mobile antennas","Interference","Wireless LAN","Fading","Frequency","Wireless communication","Local area networks","Monte Carlo methods","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","diversity reception","multi-access systems","fading","radio networks","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna diversity","capacity","wireless communication systems","interference-dominated wireless systems","mobile personal communications","personal communications","wireless PBX/LAN networks","system capacity","spatial diversity","multiple antennas","optimum combining","flat-Rayleigh fading wireless systems","mutually interfering users","Monte Carlo evaluations","frequency-selective fading","optimum equalization","cells","interference cancellation","mobile radio system IS-54"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582882","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00582882.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582882","startPage":"1740","endPage":"1751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of antenna diversity on the capacity of wireless communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The impact of antenna diversity on the capacity of wireless communication systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","volume":"42","issue":"234","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703085","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of antenna diversity on the capacity of wireless communication systems","sourcePdf":"00582882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036819S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"693","articleId":"582882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582889,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Previous works in this area have proposed two detectors: the correlation detector that is simple, but has poor performance for large number of users, and the optimal (minimum probability of error) detector that has exponential complexity in the number of users. Efficient multiuser detection algorithms consider the interfering user codes at the expense of electronic speed processing, unlike the optical processing achievable with the correlation detector. The multiple access system using the proposed multistage detector is shown to be of high performance and low complexity, compared to the conventional correlation detector and the optimal detector. The model studied includes multiple access interference as well as the Poisson characteristics of the optical direct detection process. An approximation to the probability of error is derived for the multistage detector, and it is compared to the actual error probability of the correlation detector, to a lower bound to the error probability of the optimal detector, and to simulation results for the multistage detector. The probability of error is calculated using a characteristic function method. Results are presented for a random code case that show a significant improvement in the performance of the OCDMA system using this detector over the correlation detector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00582889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.582889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","startPage":"1801","endPage":"1810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser detection for optical code division multiple access systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=582889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detection for optical code division multiple access systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703092","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detection for optical code division multiple access systems","sourcePdf":"00582889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0499S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"57","articleId":"582889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":582897,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The novel feature of the proposed adaptive MLSE is a channel estimation scheme, where the channel estimation is accomplished for each state in the VA along the surviving path connected to each state. This MLSE makes it possible to estimate a channel impulse response without an influence of a decision delay inherent in the VA, and the performance and complexity of the proposed procedure is controlled by the memory length of the VA. The bit error rate performance of the proposed MLSE is confirmed by experimental results.

However, in common with all other sampled-data modelling approaches, problems of accuracy and appropriate choice of formulation of difference equations still remain. Consequently, use of sampled-data models to determine frequency response is not recommended.

The final stage Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) provides a uniformly sampled reconstruction of the original signal.

Yet text retrieval is a daunting task because it is difficult to extract the semantics of natural language texts. Many problems must be resolved before natural language processing techniques can be effectively applied to a large collection of texts. Most existing text retrieval techniques rely on indexing keywords. Unfortunately, keywords or index terms alone cannot adequately capture the document contents, resulting in poor retrieval performance. Yet keyword indexing is widely used in commercial systems because it is still the most viable way by far to process large amounts of text. Using several simplifications of the vector-space model for text retrieval queries, the authors seek the optimal balance between processing efficiency and retrieval effectiveness as expressed in relevant document rankings.","doi":"10.1109/52.582976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/52.582976","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Software","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Software","pdfPath":"/iel1/52/12658/00582976.pdf","startPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Document ranking and the vector-space model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/582976/","displayDocTitle":"Document ranking and the vector-space model","volume":"14","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5542370","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Document ranking and the vector-space model","sourcePdf":"00582976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034797S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1997","isNumber":"12658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"191","articleId":"582976","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":583078,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Mobile robots rely on landmarks such as mile markers and street signs for information on global position and local traffic conditions. Due to the motion of the robot, the location, size and orientation of the landmarks are varying. Also, other objects in the scene might partially occlude the landmark. Thus, a robust recognition system is required to recognize the landmarks that may be distorted by a combination of these effects. A new fractal model called incremental fractional Brownian motion (BM) model, is developed to locate these landmarks. A new neural network architecture, reconfigurable neural network (RNN), is developed to recognize the landmarks. The fractal model is shown to be invariant to changes in intensity of incident light. The landmark candidate regions detected by the ifBM model are analyzed by the RNN. New learning rules based on update normalization are developed to decrease learning time and increase system stability. The network also has the ability to learn new patterns with minimal retraining time. The network is tested with images of actual street signs that were distorted by scale changes, rotations and occlusions.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1993.583175","startPage":"612","endPage":"618 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS '93)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1993.583175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12643","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS '93)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4461/12643/00583175.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outdoor landmark recognition using fractal based vision and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583175/","displayDocTitle":"Outdoor landmark recognition using fractal based vision and neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5043359","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outdoor landmark recognition using fractal based vision and neural networks","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00583175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030799S","chronDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","isNumber":"12643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4461","articleId":"583175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":583188,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed scheme compares well with the performance of alternative parallel acquisition schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.583410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00583410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.583410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","startPage":"1957","endPage":"1968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid sequence acquisition for DS/CDMA systems employing Kasami sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=583410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rapid sequence acquisition for DS/CDMA systems employing Kasami sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703108","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid sequence acquisition for DS/CDMA systems employing Kasami sequences","sourcePdf":"00583410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040942S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","articleId":"583410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":583411,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

The proposed overlay of spread spectrum signals on existing narrowband users implies strong interference for the SS system. The paper discusses how system performance can be improved by preprocessing to suppress narrowband interference. Linear prediction filters have been proposed since the 1980s for suppression of narrowband interference. Vijayan and Poor (1991) proposed nonlinear methods of suppressing the narrowband signal with significant increase in the SNR improvement. The present authors derive an enhancement to this nonlinear prediction and achieve further improvement by applying the technique to interpolating filter structures. Finally, they extend results to the case of multiple spread spectrum users and demonstrate how nonlinear filtering can dramatically outperform linear filtering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.583411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00583411.pdf","startPage":"1969","endPage":"1979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.583411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrowband interference suppression in CDMA spread spectrum communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=583411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583411/","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband interference suppression in CDMA spread spectrum communications","volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","accessionNumber":"4703109","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband interference suppression in CDMA spread spectrum communications","sourcePdf":"00583411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032768S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"141","articleId":"583411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":583419,"authors":[{"name":"Young Jong Cho","affiliation":["C&C Development Laboratory, GSIC Network Group, Anyang, Kyonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Jong Cho","id":"37277473900"},{"name":"Chong Kwan Un","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chong Kwan Un","id":"37344383600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"583419","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=583419","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Performance analysis","Automatic repeat request","Pattern analysis","System recovery","Throughput","Telecommunications","Mathematical model","Data communication","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","protocols","Markov processes","telecommunication channels","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARQ error controls","Markovian block error pattern","performance analysis","forward/backward channel memory","transmission errors","backward channel errors","modified go-back-N","timer control","buffer control","modified selective-repeat","modified stop-and-wait","modified ARQ","simulation results","analytical results","throughput","delay","error burstiness","independent error","protocols"]}],"abstract":"The authors investigate the effect of forward/backward channel memory (statistical dependence in the occurrence of transmission errors) on ARQ error controls. To take into account the effect of backward channel errors in the performance analysis, they suppose some modified ARQ schemes that have an effective retransmission strategy to prevent the deadlock incurred by the errors on acknowledgments. They consider two modified go-back-N schemes with timer control and with buffer control, one modified selective-repeat scheme and one modified stop-and-wait scheme. By analytical and simulation results, they show how much the performance in throughput and delay of the modified ARQ schemes is affected by the degree of error burstiness when the forward and backward channels are governed by a first-order Markovian block error pattern. They also show that there exists a large difference between the performances with the burst and independent error cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.1994.583419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12645/00583419.pdf","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.1994.583419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of ARQ error controls under Markovian block error pattern","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of ARQ error controls under Markovian block error pattern","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4703117","volume":"42","issue":"234","publicationDate":"FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of ARQ error controls under Markovian block error pattern","sourcePdf":"00583419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091818S","chronDate":"Feb/Mar/Apr 1994","isNumber":"12645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","articleId":"583419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":583444,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

Since there are a variety of models proposed within both technologies, we focus on the most significant model, i.e., Back Propagation Network (BPN) (J. McClelland et al., 1986) and Wang's fuzzy rule generator (L.X. Wang and J.M Mendel, 1992). First in the evaluation, we introduce a gravity effect field to illustrate these two models' influence under the existence of one instance. After that, we virtually construct two classification problems and discuss the behaviors of both methods through the gravity effect field. Finally, we propose another two real examples to demonstrate the results. We conclude that Wang's method is more suitable for piecewise region classification and needs more representative or complete training samples than BPN. BPN is more training data tolerant and less network parameter sensible than that of Wang's fuzzy rule generator. However, basic instinct problems still exist, BPN behavior is more black box than fuzzy rule generator.","doi":"10.1109/AFSS.1996.583561","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"Soft Computing in Intelligent Systems and Information Processing.

This process is used to verify the initial rule base and the rules refined by KBNN/TFS. With the interactive interface of ICE, we can detect redundant rules, subsumed rules, and conflict rules. Besides, we can also use RID to insert and delete fuzzy rules automatically if necessary. The proposed model is tested with an inverted pendulum system (IPS). In these experiments, we demonstrate the ability of ICE/RID to remove inconsistencies and insert rules in KBNN/TFS. With the combination of ICE/RID and KBNN/TFS, a valid and consistent rule base can be obtained.","doi":"10.1109/AFSS.1996.583599","startPage":"248","endPage":"253","publicationTitle":"Soft Computing in Intelligent Systems and Information Processing.

For overcoming this drawback, we incorporate the genetic search strategies in the fuzzy clustering algorithm to explore the data space from a multiple-point concept. The direct application of the genetic algorithms to the fuzzy clustering is not suitable, because sometimes the data set is enormous. Under this situation, the chromosome would be too long, so a distributed approach to fuzzy clustering by genetic algorithms is proposed to divide the huge search space into many small ones. The simulation results show our algorithm works fine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583630/","accessionNumber":"5540762","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A distributed approach to fuzzy clustering by genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed approach to fuzzy clustering by genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Kenting, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00583630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020746S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec 1996","isNumber":"12608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445","citationCount":"3","articleId":"583630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":583641,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Kai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chuan-Kai Lin","id":"37856390500"},{"name":"Sheng-De Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-De Wang","id":"37280449700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3687-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"583641","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Fuzzy systems","Fourier transforms","Multidimensional systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control system synthesis","Erbium","Buildings","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","fuzzy logic","inference mechanisms","uncertainty handling","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy model","wavelet transforms","fuzzy inference system","discrete wavelet transform","fuzzy rule","wavelet basis function","functional equivalence"]}],"abstract":"An approach using wavelet transforms to construct a fuzzy model is proposed.

The current algorithms proposed for data mining of association rules make repeated passes over the database to determine the commonly occurring item sets (or set of items). For large databases, the I/O overhead in scanning the database can be extremely high. The authors show that random sampling of transactions in the database is an effective method for finding association rules. Sampling can speed up the mining process by more than an order of magnitude by reducing I/O costs and drastically shrinking the number of transactions to be considered. They may also be able to make the sampled database resident in main-memory. Furthermore, they show that sampling can accurately represent the data patterns in the database with high confidence. They experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of sampling on different databases, and study the relationship between the performance, accuracy, and confidence of the chosen sample.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RIDE.1997.583696","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventh International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering.

In order to do so, the authors propose a method, called Ariadne's clew algorithm, to build a global path planner based on the combination of two local planning algorithms: an explore algorithm and a search algorithm. The purpose of the explore algorithm is to collect information about the environment with an increasingly fine resolution by placing landmarks in the searched space. The goal of the search algorithm is to opportunistically check if the target can be easily reached from any given placed landmark. The Ariadne's clew algorithm is shown to be very fast is most cases, allowing planning in dynamic environment. It is shown to be complete, which means that it is sure to find a path when one exists. A massively parallel implementation of this algorithm is described.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1993.583784","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS '93)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS '93)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4461/12646/00583784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1993.583784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12646","startPage":"1373","endPage":"1380 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The \"Ariadne's clew\" algorithm: global planning with local methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=583784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The \"Ariadne's clew\" algorithm: global planning with local methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583784/","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5043462","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The \"Ariadne's clew\" algorithm: global planning with local methods","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00583784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053045S","chronDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","isNumber":"12646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4461","citationCount":"54","articleId":"583784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":583790,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To fulfill all these requirements a conventional transversal surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter needs a large chip size. In order to reduce the total chip length we folded the propagation path of the SAW taking advantage of the reflector filter technique. Therefore, the usable time window for weighting becomes almost twice as large. We employed weighted reflectors not only to reflect the SAW but also to shape the filter frequency response. Thus we have more flexibility to design the transducers. We can make them shorter but still have lower impedances on quartz than with an unweighted reflector design. With this technique, we built filters at a center frequency of 110 MHz with an insertion attenuation of less than 15 dB, a 5 dB bandwidth of 1.26 MHz and an attenuation of more than 30 dB outside of a 1.80 MHz band. The chip is mounted in a 15.6/spl times/6.8 mm/sup 2/ SMD package. The reflector filter fulfills the frequency response specification required for CDMA mobile telephones on a chip length reduced by about 4 mm compared with the transversal or SPUDT design technique.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1996.583790","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Among these components, the last generation of SAW filters and signal processing devices, presenting low loss, flexible frequency and phase response characteristics, control of spurious, etc., have played a major role in designing new equipment and redesigning existing systems. The highest frequency obtainable with SAW technology in practical devices is limited to a couple of GHz, usually due to restrictions in the fabrication process involved and SAW propagation characteristics. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and shear horizontal (SH) mode, presenting phase velocities circa 40% superior than the SAW and low attenuation along certain directions, have permitted the construction of devices operating at higher frequencies. The High Velocity Pseudo-SAW (HVPSAW), with phase velocities about 100% higher than the SAW and low attenuation in many materials along certain directions, extends the high operating limit of SAW devices even further. In this paper the major characteristics of this new type of wave are reviewed. Extended topics such as: the boundary function magnitude behavior; the relationship between the \"growing tilted bulk-like partial waves\" and the bulk slowness; the number of roots (uncoupling of modes); the Poynting vector behavior with depth; are explored, enlightening the solution and behavior of this new type of high velocity pseudo-SAW.","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Implicit force control algorithms, such as stiffness control, damping control, impedance control, etc., can be applied to both free motion and constrained motion without switching the control law. However, precise force control is difficult, especially with nonrigid environments. The authors propose an alternative force control algorithm for nonrigid environments based on damping control, so that the transition occurs naturally. They model a damping control system with environmental dynamics and design a predictive control algorithm so that the force is precisely controlled when the motion of the robot is constrained. The proposed method is applied to a manipulator with one degree of freedom, and experimental results illustrate the validity of the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5049965","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Damping control with consideration of dynamics of environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping control with consideration of dynamics of environment","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00583841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025225S","chronDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","isNumber":"12644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4461","citationCount":"3","articleId":"583841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":583851,"authors":[{"name":"O.

But because of noise or due to the inherent weaknesses of the chosen edge detector, gaps or interruptions in the edges may occur. These gaps must be filled or linked to form a more continuous edge. A new method of edge linking is proposed that makes use of a weighting system based on edge segment position, direction, and magnitude in deciding the optimal choice of which edge segments to link. Edge pixels are labeled and formed into edge segments, and the edge segments are then linked based on the decision of the weighting system. As a result of the unique way in which the gaps between edge segments are filled, distortion of the edge image is kept minimal, the proposed edge linker can be combined with different edge detection schemes. Comparisons with a method previously proposed by the authors shows an improvement in the quality of the linked edge map produced as well as a savings in computational time.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS '93)","pdfPath":"/iel2/4461/12644/00583881.pdf","startPage":"1808","endPage":"1815 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS '93)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1993.583881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1993.583881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=583881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Template based method of edge linking using a weighted decision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Data mining","Robot vision systems","Aggregates","Pixel","Performance gain","Layout","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["template based method","edge linking","weighted decision","robot vision","edge detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/583881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Template based method of edge linking using a weighted decision","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5050005","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-30 July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Template based method of edge linking using a weighted decision","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00583881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088745S","chronDate":"26-30 Jul 1993","isNumber":"12644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4461","citationCount":"8","articleId":"583881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":583885,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

They allow the design of narrow-band low-loss filters with smooth amplitude response. In the classical type of SPUDT filters the mechanical reflections are used to cancel the electrical regeneration. Thus the impulse response is close to the one calculated using the impulse model. In this limit has been overcome for the first time. Resonances in the transducers, or between the transducers, respectively, are used for improving the performance of a SPUDT filter for a given chip size. In this paper a general approach for the design of transducers including reflections will be outlined and the correlation to already well known SAW structures, e.g., inline resonator filters, will be figured out. A classification of the different types of generalized SPUDT based SAW filters will be given.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1996.583951","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Fault tolerance is an important requirement of such systems, due to the catastrophic consequences of not tolerating faults. We study a scheme that provides fault tolerance through scheduling in real time multiprocessor systems. We schedule multiple copies of dynamic, aperiodic, nonpreemptive tasks in the system, and use two techniques that we call deallocation and overloading to achieve high acceptance ratio (percentage of arriving tasks scheduled by the system). The paper compares the performance of our scheme with that of other fault tolerant scheduling schemes, and determines how much each of deallocation and overloading affects the acceptance ratio of tasks. The paper also provides a technique that can help real time system designers determine the number of processors required to provide fault tolerance in dynamic systems. Lastly, a formal model is developed for the analysis of systems with uniform tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/12638/00584093.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/71.584093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.584093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerance through scheduling of aperiodic tasks in hard real-time multiprocessor systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerant systems","Real time systems","Multiprocessing systems","Processor scheduling","Dynamic scheduling","Computer Society","Fault tolerance","Vehicle dynamics","Redundancy","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","processor scheduling","real-time systems","fault tolerant computing","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","aperiodic task scheduling","hard real time multiprocessor systems","time critical systems","nonpreemptive tasks","deallocation","overloading","high acceptance ratio","arriving tasks","fault tolerant scheduling schemes","acceptance ratio","real time system designers","formal model","uniform tasks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerance through scheduling of aperiodic tasks in hard real-time multiprocessor systems","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5550309","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerance through scheduling of aperiodic tasks in hard real-time multiprocessor systems","sourcePdf":"00584093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039718S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"131","articleId":"584093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":584095,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

Image-based position and velocity demands for tracking are generated by detecting and segmenting optical flow within a central region of the image, and a projective construct is used to map the camera platform's joint angles into a Euclidean coordinate system within a plane, typically the ground plane, in the scene. A set of extended Kalman filters with different dynamics is implemented to analyze the trajectories, and these compete to provide the best description of the motion within an interacting multiple model. Prediction from the optimum motion model is used within the visual feedback loop to overcome visual latency. It is demonstrated that prediction from the 3D planar description gives better tracking performance than prediction based on a filtered description of observer-based 2D motion trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/34.584099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"219","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/12633/00584099.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.584099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The active recovery of 3D motion trajectories and their use in prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Cameras","Delay","Feedback loop","Image motion analysis","Optical detectors","Image segmentation","Optical feedback","Optical filters","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","active vision","prediction theory","filtering theory","image sequences","servomechanisms","motion estimation","target tracking","tracking","physical instrumentation control","image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active recovery","3D motion trajectories","prediction","active camera platform","planar trajectory recovery","visual feedback loop","optical flow","extended Kalman filters","optimum motion model","visual latency","filtered description","observer-based 2D motion trajectories"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"The active recovery of 3D motion trajectories and their use in prediction","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5548711","publicationDate":"March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584099/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The active recovery of 3D motion trajectories and their use in prediction","sourcePdf":"00584099.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047313S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"69","articleId":"584099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":584100,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

Because of the large overlap of the character sets found in English and major Western European languages such as French and German, some extensions of the basic English capability to those languages have taken place. However, automatic language identification prior to optical character recognition is not commonly available and adds utility to such systems. Languages and their scripts have attributes that make it possible to determine the language of a document automatically. Detection of the values of these attributes requires the recognition of particular features of the document image and, in the case of languages using Latin-based symbols, the character syntax of the underlying language. We have developed techniques for distinguishing which language is represented in an image of text. This work is restricted to a small but important subset of the world's languages. The method first classifies the script into two broad classes: Han-based and Latin-based. This classification is based on the spatial relationships of features related to the upward concavities in character structures. Language identification within the Han script class (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is performed by analysis of the distribution of optical density in the text images. We handle 23 Latin-based languages using a technique based on character shape codes, a representation of Latin text that is inexpensive to compute.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.584100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/12633/00584100.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"245","doi":"10.1109/34.584100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of the script and language content of document images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Determination of the script and language content of document images","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","accessionNumber":"5548712","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of the script and language content of document images","sourcePdf":"00584100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034801S","chronDate":"Mar 1997","isNumber":"12633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"171","articleId":"584100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":584105,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The resulting residual parallax displacement field between the two region-aligned images is an epipolar field centered at the FOE (Focus-of-Expansion). The 3D camera translation is recovered from the epipolar field. The 3D camera rotation is recovered from the computed 3D translation and the detected 2D motion.

For several decades, the material of choice has been polycrystalline ceramics based on the solid solution Pb(Zr/sub 1-x/,Ti/sub x/)O/sub 3/ (PZT), compositionally engineered near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). The search for alternative MPB systems has led researchers to revisit relaxor-based materials with the general formula Pb(B/sub 1/,B/sub 2/)O/sub 3/ (B/sub 1/:Zn/sup 2+/, Mg/sup 2+/, Sc/sup 3+/, Ni/sup 2+/..., B/sub 2/:Nb/sup 5+/, Ta/sup 5+/...). There are some claims of superior dielectric and piezoelectric performance compared to that of PZT materials. However, when the properties are examined relative to transition temperature (Tc), these differences are not significant. In the single crystal form, however, relaxor-PT materials, represented by Pb(Zn/sub 1/3/Nb/sub 2/3/)O/sub 3/-PbTiO/sub 3/ (PZN-PT), Pb(Mg/sub 1/3/Nb/sub 2/3/)O/sub 3/-PbTiO/sub 3/ (PMN-PT) have been found to exhibit longitudinal coupling coefficients (k/sub 33/)>90%, thickness coupling (k/sub T/)>63%, dielectric constants ranging from 1000 to 5000 with low dielectric loss <1%, and exceptional piezoelectric coefficients d/sub 33/>2000 pC/N, the latter promising for high energy density actuators. For single crystal piezoelectrics to become the next generation material of ultrasonic transducers, further investigation in crystal growth, device fabrication and testing are required.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1996.584146","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

The electro-mechanical behaviour of this composite, especially designed for high frequency applications, is characterised and the results are compared to theoretical predictions. To support this project, a new method of transducer simulation has been implemented. This simulation software takes into account the elementary boundary phenomena and allows prediction of inter-element coupling modes in the array. The model also yields realistic computed impulse responses of transducers, A miniature test device and water tank have been constructed to perform elementary acoustic beam pattern measurements. It is equipped with highly accurate motion controls and a specific needle-shaped target has been developed. The smallest displacement available in the three main axes of this system is 10 microns. The manufacturing of the array transducer has involved high precision dicing and micro interconnection techniques. The flexibility of the material provides us with the possibility of curving and focusing the array transducer. Performance of this experimental array are discussed and compared to the theoretical predictions. The results demonstrate that such array transducers will allow high quality near field imaging.

Earlier it has been shown that a phase contrast based magnetic resonance imaging technique can be used for cyclic shear wave displacement measurement. Echo ultrasound presents an alternate method for imaging of such shear waves. The ultrasound based method uses the phase of quadrature echo signals to estimate the local displacements due to shear wave propagation and allows for real-time measurement of such displacements. The shear wave displacements were measured in tissue-mimicking gel phantom specimens and beef muscle specimens. From the displacement measurements of propagating waves, it is possible to estimate the local wave speed using local frequency estimation techniques. The wave speeds can be used to characterize the material under investigation in terms of shear modulus and dispersion. These shear wave parameters can thus provide additional tissue characterization tools.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1996.584202","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Previously, the author has applied one of these beams called the Bessel beam to improve the measurement of velocity vector (both transverse and axial components) of flow over conventional focused beams. Here, a new limited diffraction beam called layered array beam is used to further improve the accuracy of the transverse velocity measurement by producing peaks at the boundaries of Doppler spectrum. Because the new beam can be produced with a linear array, the method can be easily incorporated into a commercial scanner. Theory, simulation, and experiment are studied for the method and the results agree excellently with each other. In addition, applications of the new beam for high frame rate imaging (up to 3750 frames/s at 200 mm depth for biological soft tissues) or for dynamic focusing in both transmit and receive without reducing frame rate are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5658297","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Improving accuracy of transverse velocity measurement with a new limited diffraction beam","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving accuracy of transverse velocity measurement with a new limited diffraction beam","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00584222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038969S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446","citationCount":"21","articleId":"584222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":584223,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The enhancement of the tunnel oxide degradation strongly depends on the refractive index of P-SiON passivation film. This result means that there is a correlation between the water resistibility of the passivation film and the tunnel oxide degradation induced by the passivation film deposition process. Moreover, the effect of post-annealing after passivation film deposition is discussed. The electron trap density is increased at the beginning and then decreased during post-annealing. The time constant of this phenomenon strongly depends on the refractive index of the passivation film. We propose the water-related electron trap model to explain the results.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 35th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel3/4455/12628/00584223.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 35th Annual","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1997.584223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1997.584223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of passivation film deposition and post-annealing on the reliability of flash memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passivation","Capacitors","Optical films","Flash memory","Semiconductor films","Degradation","Refractive index","Silicon","Annealing","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EPROM","integrated circuit reliability","semiconductor device reliability","passivation","annealing","refractive index","electron traps","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memory reliability","passivation film deposition","post-annealing","tunnel oxide degradation","P-SiON passivation film","refractive index","water resistibility","electron trap density","time constant","water-related electron trap model","NMOSFET","SiON","SiN-SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Impact of passivation film deposition and post-annealing on the reliability of flash memories","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658352","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of passivation film deposition and post-annealing on the reliability of flash memories","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00584223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031127S","chronDate":"8-10 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4455","citationCount":"6","articleId":"584223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":584259,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This leads to oxide breakdown, and the breakdown structure consists of a pair of oxygen-excess (Si-O-O-Si) and oxygen-vacancy (Si-Si) defects.

It is found that at any bias and temperature condition applied, the degradation of sufficiently short channel length (Leff/spl sime/0.14 um) devices results in a reduction in drive current due to the impact of donor type interface trap generation and positive charge formation during the stress. At these dimensions the degradation is controlled by a contribution of both Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Channel Hot Carrier (CHC) mechanism. We will show the role that each of these two mechanisms play in determining the shift of typical device parameters. A methodology to decouple the two effects is also provided allowing to quantify each contribution separately at any bias and temperature condition. A conductive CHC model that takes into account the impact of both mechanisms to the device lifetime at the worst observed degradation condition (Vg=Vd) is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1997.584274","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 35th Annual","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 35th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel3/4455/12628/00584274.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1997.584274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NBTI-channel hot carrier effects in PMOSFETs in advanced CMOS technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584274","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584274/","displayDocTitle":"NBTI-channel hot carrier effects in PMOSFETs in advanced CMOS technologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5658383","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NBTI-channel hot carrier effects in PMOSFETs in advanced CMOS technologies","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00584274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042012S","chronDate":"8-10 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4455","citationCount":"62","articleId":"584274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":584309,"authors":[{"name":"L.

To perform this analysis, digital fuse models were developed for use with the EMTP/ATP program. Expulsion fuses interrupt current at current zeros and are easily modeled. Current limiting fuses (CLFs) interrupt current by forcing a current zero and therefore, require a special modeling technique. CLFs were modeled by representing them as nonlinear resistances. The nonlinear resistances were calculated using laboratory test results of actual CLF operations. This technique is very convenient for simulating CLF operations and analyzing their interaction with the distribution system. This paper shows that CLFs improve power quality by supporting system voltage during faults and reducing voltage dip duration. Additionally, CLFs reduce the fault let-through I/sup 2/t.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of current limiting fuses in distribution systems for improved power quality and protection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.584376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/12635/00584376.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.584376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Application of current limiting fuses in distribution systems for improved power quality and protection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5555828","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of current limiting fuses in distribution systems for improved power quality and protection","sourcePdf":"00584376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031469S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"38","articleId":"584376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":584377,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.W.

The authors describe results in imaging with and without such apodizing, and describe a method for controlling channel amplitude which preserves the autonomy between channels characteristic of digital beamformers. As part of the study, the authors investigate how the classical results on windowing transfer to a high-bandwidth system such as an ultrasound scanner. The algorithm allows the array to be dynamically windowed while its aperture grows in proportion to the time after a transmit excitation. Linear and curved arrays, where the phase center changes with beam position, are also accommodated. A surprisingly versatile system is needed to provide a satisfactory apodizing function in all cases. The simulations from a bit-level model of the VLSI implementation of the algorithm show its value in improving beam quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584377/","accessionNumber":"5671819","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Windowing of wide-band ultrasound transducers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Windowing of wide-band ultrasound transducers","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00584377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042228S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446","citationCount":"12","articleId":"584377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":584379,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhu","affiliation":["Advanced Control and Systems, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Zhu","id":"37087289579"},{"name":"D.L.

The developed fault location and diagnosis system can also be applied to the investigation of temporary faults that may not result in a blown fuse. The proposed fault location algorithm is based on the steady-state analysis of the faulted distribution network. To deal with the uncertainties inherent in the system modeling and the phasor estimation, the fault location algorithm has been adapted to estimate fault regions based on probabilistic modeling and analysis. Since the distribution feeder is a radial network, multiple possibilities of fault locations could be computed with measurements available only at the substation. To identify the actual fault location, a fault diagnosis algorithm has been developed to prune down and rank the possible fault locations by integrating the available pieces of evidence. Testing of the developed fault location and diagnosis system using field data has demonstrated its potential for practical use.","doi":"10.1109/61.584379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"801","endPage":"809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.584379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12635","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/12635/00584379.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault location","Fault diagnosis","Algorithm design and analysis","Databases","Fuses","Steady-state","Modeling","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","fault location","probability","power system protection","automatic test equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated fault location","automated fault diagnosis","electric power distribution feeders","disturbance recording devices","distribution feeder database","temporary faults","steady-state analysis","phasor estimation","fault regions","probabilistic modeling","radial network","fault diagnosis algorithm","distribution automation","distribution system protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated fault location and diagnosis on electric power distribution feeders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584379/","volume":"12","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5549422","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated fault location and diagnosis on electric power distribution feeders","sourcePdf":"00584379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069149S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"161","articleId":"584379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":584380,"authors":[{"name":"H.S.

Reduced-channel arrays have a small number of transmit/receive channels multiplexed to a conventional dense array. For a 1D array of N elements, the T/R matrix is the N/spl times/N matrix of apodization values, where the rows correspond to transmit element positions and the columns correspond to receive element positions. We show that the round-trip beam pattern may be obtained from this matrix simply as the Fourier transform of its cross-diagonal sum. The aperture synthesis process consists of choosing the T/R matrix under certain constraints. If the T/R matrix has rank one, then a single transmit with parallel receive forms the beam (conventional case), and the round-trip beam can be separated into the product of the transmit beam and the receive beam. As the rank of the T/R matrix increases, greater beamforming flexibility is achieved, allowing for tradeoffs in SNR, frame-rate, and system complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1996.584385","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

During this time much has occurred to the basic architecture and functions of these clinical systems and their beamformers, which are, in many ways, the most important components of these systems. This talk will review some of the changes that have occurred and will discuss current trends in beamformer design. Throughout most of the 30 years of real time imaging, analog beamformers have been the mainstay of all instruments. The common methods for the implementation of analog beamformers for annular, linear/curved arrays, and phased arrays will be reviewed and the distinguishing characteristics identified. At the present time the industry is undergoing a major shift toward digital beamformation with the introduction of several commercial systems. Given that the earliest digital systems were available roughly 15 years ago, it is fair to say that the introduction of digital beamformers has been relatively slow. Today this shift seems to be gaining momentum. Some of the factors causing these shifts will be reviewed along the the common types of designs and implementations. The ongoing search for improved imaging performance will continue to introduce new challenges for beamformer designers. Among already proposed imaging methods and techniques are elevation focusing (1.5D arrays), synthetic apertures, 2D and sparse arrays, phase aberration correction, and others. The most common complication introduced by these is a significant increase in channel count. Further, there will also be beamformer design issues related to signal processing. These include not only Doppler processing but also the processing of signals due to novel contrast agents. Finally, with advances in computer and microelectronics technologies, the way we view beamformation may have to undergo sizeable changes. These topics will be reviewed not only as technical challenges but also in light of the constraints introduced by today's marketplace.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1996.584398","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Simulation results show that the algorithm is simple, computationally efficient and can be easily extended to minimize several other alternative harmonic-related network objective functions.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/12635/00584402.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing harmonic voltage distortion with multiple current-constrained active power line conditioners","doi":"10.1109/61.584402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.584402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing harmonic voltage distortion with multiple current-constrained active power line conditioners","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5549426","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing harmonic voltage distortion with multiple current-constrained active power line conditioners","sourcePdf":"00584402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051896S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"46","articleId":"584402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":584411,"authors":[{"name":"Yiqiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineer, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Yiqiang Chen","id":"37351433200"},{"name":"B.

Equalization is necessary (i) to ensure the even sharing of voltage stresses in the gate-turn-off thyristors (GTOs), and (ii) to prevent the degradation of total harmonic distortion (THD) factors, as all harmonic elimination strategies depend on equal voltages in their assumptions.

An example of trading modelling ability for a reduced number of parameters is given for the B-spline network.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1996.584446","startPage":"651","endPage":"654 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4443/12653/00584446.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.1996.584446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Associative memory neural networks for time series prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Neural networks","Spline","Lattices","Function approximation","Approximation methods","Vectors","Hypercubes","Multilayer perceptrons","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebellar model arithmetic computers","content-addressable storage","time series","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["associative memory neural networks","time series prediction","CMAC network","B-spline neural network","Mackey-Glass time series","bell-shaped basis function","placement strategy","modelling ability","cerebellar model articulation controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Associative memory neural networks for time series prediction","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-16 Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5637271","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associative memory neural networks for time series prediction","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"00584446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039486S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4443","citationCount":"2","articleId":"584446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":584447,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Then a new fast search method, the \"Spiral Search Algorithm\" (SSA), is introduced. It is a three step algorithm which follows a spiral path searching outwards for candidate locations that satisfy the matching criterion. The efficiency of the SSA arises from: (1) the reduction of the candidate locations without leaving out zones of pixels where the mean absolute difference is not evaluated, and (2) the reduction of computations since many candidate locations are being bailed out. A comparison of fast search methods and the Full Search (FS) approach is presented for a number of video sequences. The SSA is proven to be an excellent compromise between quality and speed. The hardware implementation of the block motion estimation algorithms is also discussed.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Third International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4443/12653/00584462.pdf","startPage":"716","endPage":"719 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast algorithms for the estimation of block motion vectors","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1996.584462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.1996.584462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Fast algorithms for the estimation of block motion vectors","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5637285","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"16-16 Oct. 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast algorithms for the estimation of block motion vectors","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"00584462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021843S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct 1996","isNumber":"12653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4443","citationCount":"6","articleId":"584462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":584465,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As a rule, an inductive process is used to design these antennas. Either an integral equation is formulated or a simulator is used that gives the current distributions on the wires of the antenna, from which the electromagnetic properties of the antenna can then be determined. Once the antenna properties are known, the parameters are optimized, using guides such as intuition, experience, simplified equations, or empirical studies. However, using an electromagnetics simulator in conjunction with a genetic algorithm (GA), it is possible to design an antenna using a completely deductive approach: the desired electromagnetic properties of the antenna are specified, and the wire configuration that most closely produces these results is then synthesized by the algorithm. In this paper, we describe four antennas designed using GAs. The first is a monopole, loaded with a modified folded dipole that was designed to radiate uniform power over the hemisphere at a frequency of 1.6 GHz. The second antenna consists of seven wires, the locations and lengths of which are determined by the GA alone, that radiates waves with right-hand-circular polarization at elevation angles above 10/spl deg/, also at 1.6 GHz. The last two antennas are modified Yagis. One is designed for a broad frequency band and very low sidelobes at a center frequency of 235 MHz. The other is designed for high gain at a single frequency of 432 MHz. We have built and tested these antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584498/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5612927","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"Wire-antenna designs using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wire-antenna designs using genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00584498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044438S","chronDate":"April  1997","isNumber":"12669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"127","articleId":"584498","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":584499,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Switches were also used to control banks of binary-weighted capacitors that determine the filter center frequency, quality factor as well as its order. The bilinear transformation were utilized in the SC implementation of the filter resistive elements. Extra care was considered in the design procedure to minimize the effect of stray capacitors on the network transfer functions.

Then we determine which tasks should reduce their execution time to compensate that amount of time deviation. The reduction of execution time is achieved by implementing parts of the tasks with hardware. With this approach, we can systematically design a hard real-time system which is infeasible with all software implementation.

However, it places a burden on the designer to develop several communication routines, at different levels of abstraction, for each communication operation. This often requires an intimate understanding of both the simulator and the design being simulated. We present and demonstrate a way to use communication transaction annotations to provide a platform independent language for describing fast communication primitives. Additionally we show a tool for automatically generating some of these annotations, so that the designer does not even require an intimate understanding of the design under simulation. This can be important when simulating systems where the design itself is synthesized by automatic tools, and is liable to change frequently.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing communication in embedded system co-simulation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 5th International Workshop on Hardware/Software Co Design.

This paper investigates the limits to the performance enhancements obtainable using software acceleration techniques. A practical target architecture, based on the use of programmable logic, is used to illustrate the problems associated with software acceleration. It is shown that, normally, little benefit can be obtained by applying software acceleration methods to general-purpose applications. Whereas software acceleration can profitably be used in a limited number of special-purpose applications, a designer would probably be better off developing ASIP (application-specific instruction-set processor) components, based on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 5th International Workshop on Hardware/Software Co Design.

This allows the attainment of several edge maps containing different features. From the various edge maps, edges are arbitrated in order to perform the merging of the different maps. The arbitration is done using a perceptron neural network. To overcome the increased computing time, implementation is being performed on a multi-transputer array, using the inherent parallelism of the techniques involved. In this paper, we present examples that show the performance of the neural arbitration of different techniques along with a comparison with the individual techniques alone.

The paper explores a cyclical pattern in the relationship between product and process R&D on the one hand and the short-term return on investment (ROI) of the business on the other hand. The total level of R&D investment plays a key role in this relationship. The foundation of this paper is based on prior work about the changing role of R&D over the life cycle of a new product or a new technology. It is also based on the notions of the S-curve response function and the limited compatibility between product and process R&D. The empirical part of the paper is derived from the PIMS database where the sampling units are strategic business units (SBUs). It is, therefore, different from studies where the focus of analysis is a single product or technology. Two forms of analysis are presented: correlation analysis of the hypothesized relationship and nonparametric tests of the stability of findings. The analysis assumes a lagged relationship between the investment in R&D and performance in terms of ROI. The primary conclusion is that product and process R&D modestly affect ROI two years later. The relationship appears to be different depending on the level of total R&D spending.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Research and development","Production","Technological innovation","Investments","Business","Industrial relations","Productivity","Profitability","Databases","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economics","research and development management","investment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process R&D","product R&D","short-term return on investment","total R&D budget","business profitability","cyclical pattern","S-curve response function","PIMS database","strategic business units","correlation analysis","hypothesized relationship","nonparametric tests","stability","total R&D spending"]}],"doi":"10.1109/17.584920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel1/17/12666/00584920.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/17.584920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The R&D cycle: the influence of product and process R&D on short-term ROI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The R&D cycle: the influence of product and process R&D on short-term ROI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584920/","volume":"44","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5587765","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The R&D cycle: the influence of product and process R&D on short-term ROI","sourcePdf":"00584920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042572S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"6","articleId":"584920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":584931,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

This paper describes the design of a compact travelling-wave ESD simulator with benchtop-scale dimensions. The design process utilized frequency-domain measurements and computer simulations of wave attenuation on the part of the simulator representing the human arm. From these results, it was deduced that the ESD simulator arm could be shortened from its original human-scale length of 60 cm to a more compact 30 cm without significantly affecting the currents flowing on it. The part of the simulator representing the human body was designed on the basis of capacitance. The resulting travelling-wave simulator (arm and body) is approximately half the size of the original simulator. Measurements are presented comparing the compact simulator with a previously-designed full-size simulator and with a human test subject, with regard to arm currents, swept-frequency input impedance, and capacitance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/12671/00584931.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.584931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.584931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact traveling-wave physical simulator for human ESD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Electrostatic discharge","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Electronic equipment testing","Computer simulation","Capacitance","Electronic equipment","Process design","Attenuation measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic discharge","simulation","bioelectric phenomena","electronic equipment testing","frequency-domain synthesis","capacitance","electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact traveling-wave physical simulator","human ESD","travelling-wave electrostatic discharge simulators","human discharge","benchtop-scale dimension","frequency-domain measurements","wave attenuation","human arm","ESD simulator arm","capacitance","body","arm currents","swept-frequency input impedance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Compact traveling-wave physical simulator for human ESD","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5593563","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact traveling-wave physical simulator for human ESD","sourcePdf":"00584931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028887S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"27","articleId":"584931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":584932,"authors":[{"name":"W.V.

Each expert is a Kalman filter modeled with a different realization of the unknown system parameters such as process and measurement noise. The gating network performs on-line adaptation of the weights given to individual filter estimates based on performance. This scheme compares very favorably with the classical Magill filter bank, which is based on a Bayesian technique, in terms of: estimation accuracy; quicker response to changing environments; and numerical stability and computational demands. The proposed filter bank is further enhanced by periodically using a search algorithm in a feedback loop. Two search algorithms are considered. The first algorithm uses a recursive quadratic programming approach which extremizes a modified maximum likelihood function to update the parameters of the best performing filter in the bank. This particular approach to parameter adaptation allows a real-time implementation. The second algorithm uses a genetic algorithm to search for the parameter vector and is suited for post-processed data type applications. The workings and power of the overall filter bank and the suggested adaptation schemes are illustrated by a number of examples.","doi":"10.1109/3477.584952","pdfPath":"/iel1/3477/12667/00584952.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.584952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mixture-of-experts framework for adaptive Kalman filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"A mixture-of-experts framework for adaptive Kalman filtering","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5593007","pubMedId":"18255884","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mixture-of-experts framework for adaptive Kalman filtering","sourcePdf":"00584952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042588S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"48","articleId":"584952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":584953,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

There is an expectation that neural networks will play an important role in automating knowledge acquisition and encoding, however, the problem solving knowledge of a neural network is represented at a subsymbolic level and hence is very difficult for a human user to comprehend. One way to provide an understanding of the behavior of neural networks is to extract their problem solving knowledge in terms of rules that can be provided to users. Several papers which propose extracting rules from feedforward neural networks can be found in the literature, however, these approaches can only deal with networks with binary inputs. Furthermore, certain approaches lack theoretical support and their usefulness and effectiveness are debatable. Upon carefully analyzing these approaches, we propose a method to extract fuzzy rules from networks with continuous-valued inputs. The method was tested using a real-life problem (decision-making by pilots involving combat situations) and found to be effective.","doi":"10.1109/3477.584953","pdfPath":"/iel1/3477/12667/00584953.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.584953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing understanding of the behavior of feedforward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/584953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"Providing understanding of the behavior of feedforward neural networks","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5593008","pubMedId":"18255885","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing understanding of the behavior of feedforward neural networks","sourcePdf":"00584953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035692S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"15","articleId":"584953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":584957,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Updating is achieved by utilizing the low-pass frequency response of wavelength conversion via cross gain modulation in semiconductor optical amplifiers to suppress the original subcarrier multiplexed header while efficiently converting the baseband payload. A new header is then inserted by optically modulating the output of the wavelength converter with the new subcarrier encoded data. Updating of a pseudorandom 100 Mb/s header coded on a 16.5-GHz microwave subcarrier is achieved with wavelength conversion of a 2.5 Gb/s pseudorandom baseband payload. Crosstalk measurements are presented to determine cascadability of this technique and indicate that subcarrier suppression of 16.9 dBe followed by 20.2-dBe remodulation overcomes degradation due to residual original subcarrier and remodulation of the baseband payload. A key feature of this technique is the preservation of all-optical baseband payload transparency up to the header subcarrier frequency.","doi":"10.1109/68.585004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.585004","endPage":"829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/12668/00585004.pdf","startPage":"827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-optical updating of subcarrier encoded packet headers with simultaneous wavelength conversion of baseband payload in semiconductor optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585004/","displayDocTitle":"All-optical updating of subcarrier encoded packet headers with simultaneous wavelength conversion of baseband payload in semiconductor optical amplifiers","volume":"9","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5599849","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-optical updating of subcarrier encoded packet headers with simultaneous wavelength conversion of baseband payload in semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00585004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079991S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"18","articleId":"585004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":585008,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

It is found that common midpoint signals are not identical (or redundant) for echoes coming from arbitrary target distributions in the near field. A dynamic near-field correction is proposed to reduce the difference between common midpoint signals for echoes coming from the region of interest. When phase aberrations are present, it is shown that the dynamic correction can generally be done assuming no phase aberration, and the relative time-shift between common midpoint signals can be used to measure phase-aberration profiles. A phase-aberration correction algorithm based on that principle is proposed. In this algorithm, after common midpoint signals are collected they are dynamically corrected for near-field effects and cross-correlated with one another. In a related way, the phase errors are measured from peak positions of these cross-correlation functions. The phase-aberration profile across the array is derived from these measurements. The relationship between the errors in the derived phase aberration profile and the errors in the measured relative time-shift between common midpoint signals is derived. A method for treating the situation of different transmission and reception phase-aberration profiles is also proposed. This algorithm works for general target distributions, iteration is not required, and it can be used in other near-field, pulse-echo, imaging systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/12680/00585120.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.585120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.585120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase aberration correction using near-field signal redundancy.

The filter can be described by a complex valued matrix, and a frequency response is defined. However, in contrast to a time invariant filter, the general linear filter may create frequency components which are not present in the input signal. This produces bias in the velocity and velocity spread estimates. It is shown that the clutter filter effect on the autocorrelation estimates can be described by a frequency domain transfer function, but unlike time invariant filters, the transfer function is different for each temporal lag of the autocorrelation function. Using a two dimensional (axial and temporal dimension) model of the received signal, the bias in velocity and velocity spread is quantified, both for the autocorrelation algorithm and the time shift cross-correlation estimator.

The spectral purity of the conventional direct digital synthesizer (DDS) is also determined by the resolution of the values stored in the sine table ROM. Therefore, it is desirable to increase the resolution of the ROM. Unfortunately, larger ROM storage means higher power consumption, lower reliability, lower speed, and greatly increased costs. Different memory compression and algorithmic techniques and their effect on distortion and trade-offs are investigated in detail. A computer program has been created to simulate the effects of the memory compression and algorithmic techniques on the output spectrum of the DDS.

The approach focuses on integrating neural networks into an expert system. The system employs evidential reasoning to identify malfunctions by combining evidence originating from equipment maintenance history, on-line sensor data, and in-line post-process measurements. Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component. Predicted failure rates are then converted to belief levels. For on-line diagnosis in the ease of previously unencountered faults, a CUSUM control chart is implemented on real sensor data to detect very small process shifts and their trends. For the known fault case, continuous hypothesis testing on the statistical mean and variance of the sensor data is performed to search for similar data patterns and assign belief levels. Finally, neural process models of process figures of merit (such as etch uniformity) derived from prior experimentation are used to analyze the in-line measurements, and identify the most suitable candidate among faulty input parameters (such as gas flow) to explain process shifts. A working prototype for this hybrid diagnostic system has been implemented on the Plasma Therm 700 series reactive ion etcher located in the Georgia Tech Microelectronics Research Center.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5597686","volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-time diagnosis of semiconductor manufacturing equipment using a hybrid neural network expert system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time diagnosis of semiconductor manufacturing equipment using a hybrid neural network expert system","sourcePdf":"00585143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042471S","chronDate":"Jan 1997","isNumber":"12673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3476","citationCount":"22","articleId":"585143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":585144,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Researchers and engineers have created many novel methods to inject faults, which can be implemented in both hardware and software. The contrast between the hardware and software methods lies mainly in the fault injection points they can access, the cost and the level of perturbation. Hardware methods can inject faults into chip pins and internal components, such as combinational circuits and registers that are not software-addressable. On the other hand, software methods are convenient for directly producing changes at the software-state level. Thus, we use hardware methods to evaluate low-level error detection and masking mechanisms, and software methods to test higher level mechanisms. Software methods are less expensive, but they also incur a higher perturbation overhead because they execute software on the target system.","doi":"10.1109/2.585157","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/12687/00585157.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.585157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault injection techniques and tools","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fault injection techniques and tools","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5573691","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault injection techniques and tools","sourcePdf":"00585157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02522S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"468","articleId":"585157","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585163,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Signal averaging, matched filtering, frequency spectrum analysis, neural nets, and autoregressive analysis have all been used to analyze ultrasonic signals. The Wavelet Transform (WT) is the most recent technique for processing signals with time-varying spectra. Interest in wavelets and their potential applications has resulted in an explosion of papers; some have called the wavelets the most significant mathematical event of the past decade. In this work, the Wavelet Transform is utilized to improve ultrasonic flaw detection in noisy signals as an alternative to the Split-Spectrum Processing (SSP) technique. In SSP, the frequency spectrum of the signal is split using overlapping Gaussian passband filters with different central frequencies and fixed absolute bandwidth. A similar approach is utilized in the WT, but in this case the relative bandwidth is constant, resulting in a filter bank with a self-adjusting window structure that can display the temporal variation of the signal's spectral components with varying resolutions.

The losses in lateral and contrast resolution are associated with increases in the width of the mainbeam and increases in sidelobe levels, respectively. These two forms of resolution loss represent significant hurdles to improving the clinical utility of biomedical ultrasonic imaging. A number of research efforts are currently under way to investigate the defocusing effects of tissue and to consider corrective measures. All of these efforts assume linear propagation, and base the image-formation process on the reception of the transmitted pulse. A novel pulse echo imaging scheme in which the image is formed using the finite amplitude distortion components of the received pulse is considered here. Alternatively, this could be described as image formation using the nonlinearly-generated higher harmonics. In homogeneous beam propagations, it has been established that the sidelobes of nonlinearly-generated higher harmonics are much lower than their linear counterparts. Computations considered here suggest that this relationship also holds for the case of propagations through abdominal wall and breast wall tissue. These computations also suggest that the lateral resolution limits imposed by abdominal wall and breast wall tissue are slightly smaller for nonlinearly-generated second harmonics than for their linear counterparts. The resulting potential of these higher harmonics to improve image resolution is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/58.585208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/12692/00585208.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.585208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite amplitude distortion-based inhomogeneous pulse echo ultrasonic imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585208/","displayDocTitle":"Finite amplitude distortion-based inhomogeneous pulse echo ultrasonic imaging","volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5505154","pubMedId":"18244110","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite amplitude distortion-based inhomogeneous pulse echo ultrasonic imaging","sourcePdf":"00585208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039271S","chronDate":"Jan.  1997","isNumber":"12692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"181","articleId":"585208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585209,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

These aberrations can be modeled as a near field thin phase screen or as a distributed aberrator. The effect of a near field thin phase screen is to time shift the received echo at each element, while distributed aberrators result in both pulse distortions and time shifts from element to element. Most current techniques for the correction of distributed aberrators are limited to application on point targets. A new technique is proposed which uses multiple transmits from spatially shifted transmit apertures (the translating transmit aperture algorithm), in conjunction with phase conjugate filters, to correct for distributed aberrations in the presence of speckle targets. The performance of the translating transmit aperture algorithm in improving the correlation between signals received by elements of different spatial separations is measured, and factors affecting the performance of this technique are investigated in simulation and experiment.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/12692/00585209.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"151","doi":"10.1109/58.585209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.585209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A speckle target adaptive imaging technique in the presence of distributed aberrations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1997","displayDocTitle":"A speckle target adaptive imaging technique in the presence of distributed aberrations","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5505155","pubMedId":"18244111","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A speckle target adaptive imaging technique in the presence of distributed aberrations","sourcePdf":"00585209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044536S","chronDate":"Jan.  1997","isNumber":"12692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"65","articleId":"585209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":585211,"authors":[{"name":"E.N.

The strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. The strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution.

Two formulations of this problem are given as follows: (1) scheduling equal length tests with power constraints and (2) scheduling unequal length tests with power constraints. Optimum solutions are obtained for both formulations. Algorithms consist of four basic steps. First, a test compatibility graph is constructed from the resource graph. Second, the test compatibility graph is used to identify a complete set of time compatible tests with power dissipation information associated with each test. Third, from the set of compatible tests, lists of power compatible tests are extracted. Finally, a minimum cover table approach is used to find an optimum schedule of power compatible tests.","doi":"10.1109/92.585217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/12675/00585217.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.585217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling tests for VLSI systems under power constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585217/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling tests for VLSI systems under power constraints","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5608363","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling tests for VLSI systems under power constraints","sourcePdf":"00585217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106181S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"199","articleId":"585217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":585219,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Tai Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Tai Lai","id":"37087179435"},{"name":"Ping-Tsung Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ping-Tsung Wang","id":"37087285225"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"585219","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":241},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Programmable logic arrays","Switches","Integrated circuit interconnections","Clustering algorithms","Routing","Wire","Logic arrays","Logic devices","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD","circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit layout","network routing","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hierarchical interconnection structures","logic block clustering","recursive grouping","routability","computer aided design algorithms","k-way min-cut algorithm","placement step","global routing paths","benchmark circuits","density improvement","performance improvement"]}],"abstract":"Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's) suffer from lower density and lower performance than conventional gate arrays.

The performance of these techniques is limited because the signals are corrupted by various factors including electronic noise, quantization, and speckle decorrelation. Speckle decorrelation is caused by changes in the coherent interference among scatterers when the tissue moves relative to the ultrasound beam. In time delay estimation, the effect of noise is usually addressed through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) term. Decorrelation, often a significant source of error in medical ultrasound, is commonly described in terms of the correlation coefficient. A relationship between the correlation coefficient and the SNR was previously derived in the literature, for identical signals corrupted by uncorrelated random noise. In this paper, we derive the relationship between the peak of the correlation coefficient function and the SNR for two jointly stationary signals when a delay is present between the signals. Recently, an expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) has been derived in the literature for partially decorrelated signals in terms of the SNR and the correlation coefficient. Since the applicability of the CRLB is determined not only by the SNR, but also by the correlation coefficient, it is important to unify the expression for the CRLB for partially correlated signals. In this paper, we derive an expression for the CRLB in term of an equivalent SNR converted from the correlation coefficient using an SNR-p relationship, and show this expression to be equivalent to the expression for CRLB. We also corroborate the validity of the SNR-p expression with a simulation. Using this formulation, correlation measurements can be converted to SNR to obtain a composite SNR. The use of this composite SNR in lieu of those in the CRLB expression in the literature allows the extension of the literature results to the solution of the common TDE problems that involve signal decorrelation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1997","accessionNumber":"5505165","pubMedId":"18244121","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The combined effect of signal decorrelation and random noise on the variance of time delay estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The combined effect of signal decorrelation and random noise on the variance of time delay estimation","sourcePdf":"00585223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034239S","chronDate":"Jan.  1997","isNumber":"12692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"71","articleId":"585223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":585224,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Jin Jeong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong-Jin Jeong","id":"37087345649"},{"name":"W.P.

The algorithms are designed for Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) cryptography and are based on the familiar iterative Horner's rule, but use precalculated complements of the modulus. The problem of deciding which multiples of the modulus to subtract in intermediate iteration stages has been simplified using simple look-up of precalculated complement numbers, thus allowing a finer-grain pipeline. Both algorithms use a carry save adder scheme with module reduction performed on each intermediate partial product which results in an output in carry-save format. Regularity and local connections make both algorithms suitable for high-performance array implementation in FPGA's or deep submicron VLSI. The processing nodes consist of just one or two full adders and a simple multiplexor. The stored complement numbers need to be precalculated only when the modulus is changed, thus not affecting the performance of the main computation. In both cases, there exists a bit-level systolic schedule, which means the array can be fully pipelined for high performance and can also easily be mapped to linear arrays for various space/time tradeoffs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/12675/00585224.pdf","doi":"10.1109/92.585224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.585224","startPage":"211","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI array algorithms and architectures for RSA modular multiplication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585224/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI array algorithms and architectures for RSA modular multiplication","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5608366","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI array algorithms and architectures for RSA modular multiplication","sourcePdf":"00585224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037552S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"34","articleId":"585224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585226,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Of particular importance for the case of Gibbs priors is the global hyperparameter, /spl beta/, which multiplies the Hamiltonian. Here we consider maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of /spl beta/ from incomplete data, i.e., problems in which the image, which is drawn from a Gibbs prior, is observed indirectly through some degradation or blurring process. Important applications include image restoration and image reconstruction from projections. Exact ML estimation of /spl beta/ from incomplete data is intractable for most image processing. Here we present an approximate ML estimator that is computed simultaneously with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) image estimate. The algorithm is based on a mean field approximation technique through which multidimensional Gibbs distributions are approximated by a separable function equal to a product of one-dimensional (1-D) densities.

This paper examines the design and implementation of a CMOS /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator for digital-audio A/D conversion that operates from a single 1.8-V power supply. A cascaded modulator that maintains a large full-scale input range while avoiding signal clipping at internal nodes is introduced. The experimental modulator has been designed with fully differential switched-capacitor integrators employing different input and output common-mode levels and boosted clock drivers in order to facilitate low voltage operation. Precise control of common-mode levels, high power supply noise rejection, and low power dissipation are obtained through the use of two-stage, class A/AB operational amplifiers. At a sampling rate of 4 MHz and an oversampling ratio of 80, an implementation of the modulator in a 0.8-/spl mu/m CMOS technology with metal-to-polycide capacitors and NMOS and PMOS threshold voltages of +0.65 V and -0.75 V, respectively, achieves a dynamic range of 99 dB at a Nyquist conversion rate of 50 kHz.

Target specifications are 7 b of linearity at 20 MSample/s with a signal bandwidth from DC to 10 MHz. Such a filter is applicable to 64-QAM digital modems over coaxial cable or twisted-pairs. The filter is implemented using switched currents. A single transconductor acts as the front-end interface circuit and converts an analog differential input voltage signal to a differential current. The signal current is sampled and held by class-AB current copier cells. The sampled current signals, unlike conventional CCD FIR filters, are held within the current copier cells and are not propagated through the taps. The robust digital coefficients are propagated, instead of the sensitive analog signals. Hence, the loss of signal fidelity is determined solely by leakage of the copier cells rather than the propagation loss. The filter, implemented in 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS, is fully-programmable and can be configured to perform lowpass or bandpass functions respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Propagation losses","Prototypes","Linearity","Bandwidth","Digital filters","Modems","Coaxial cables","Transconductors","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","FIR filters","switched current circuits","switched filters","programmable filters","low-pass filters","band-pass filters","sampled data filters","active filters5602157","switched capacitor filters","band-pass filters","operational amplifiers","active filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled-data switched-current filter","analog FIR filter","16-tap filter","digitally programmable coefficients","CMOS IC","64-QAM digital modems","transconductor","class-AB current copier cells","lowpass function","bandpass function","0.8 micron","10 MHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585258","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The log-domain filter principle achieves instantaneous signal companding by taking advantage of exponential device characteristics. Thanks to the high compression ratio, voltage swing and frequency tuning become almost independent of supply voltage, which can be reduced to the minimum required for proper operation. The combination of instantaneous companding with class AB operation permits processing of signals much larger than the bias level and hence increases dynamic range substantially. Class AB log-domain filters are suited to low-voltage and low power applications with moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and linearity requirements. The authors present a 3/sup rd/-order Chebyshev filter which is based on an integrator and implemented in a 1 /spl mu/m BiCMOS process. The filter can be tuned over more than 3 decades with cut-off frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 15 MHz at supply voltages between 0.9 V and 2 V. For a 1.2 V supply, cut-off frequencies up to about 1 MHz are achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Filters","Voltage","Dynamic range","Cutoff frequency","Noise reduction","Circuit noise","Costs","Power dissipation","Circuit optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","Chebyshev filters","circuit tuning","integrating circuits","active filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS process","log-domain filter","companding","class AB operation","dynamic range","low-voltage applications","low power applications","third-order Chebyshev filter","integrator based design","10 kHz to 15 MHz","0.9 to 2 V","52.5 dB","1 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585259","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

Though a 1.2 V 49 ns bulk-DRAM has been reported, still lower voltage operation is difficult for bulk-DRAMs, due to the back bias effect and large junction capacitance. SOI devices have several advantages over bulk devices, such as small subthreshold swing (S-factor), elimination of the back bias effect, and small junction capacitance. To utilize these advantages, many SOI-DRAM studies and proposals have been made. The basic operation of the SOI-DRAM at 2.3 V has been examined using an experimental 64 kb SOI-DRAM, and a 3 V 50 ns 16 Mb SOI-DRAM has been also reported. Here the authors present a 1 V 46 ns 16 Mb SOI-DRAM which uses a 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS/SIMOX process. To accelerate low-voltage speed, a body-pulsed sense amplifier (BPS) and body-driven equalizer (BDEQ) are used. The conventional body-control technique uses partially-depleted (PD) transistors.

An array architecture, with very-long word (VLW) transfer circuits, probes DRAM internal nodes and transfers a 4 kb pass or fail bit-map. An on-wafer test management unit (TMU), includes a failed-address aligner (FAA) that converts a transferred 4 kb VLW into two streams of l0 b/spl times/l6 w(word) failed-address data. Major BIST functions are continuous test vector generation and failed-bit detection. Line test widely known as a failed-bit detection method, reduces the final test time. However, line-test circuits are not adequate to search and identify failed-bits in DRAM wafer test. In this on-wafer BIST, if failed-bits are detected, the failed-addresses are directly sent to an external tester, shortening failed-bit search time to within the same order as line-test time. The DRAM and two TMUs (UP and DN) concurrently operate on a wafer.

Lithographic technology has permitted this density increase through 70% reduction in the minimum design rule for each subsequent DRAM generation. However, for further density increase, another memory cell reduction technology is needed. Multi-level storage is one circuit technology that can reduce the effective cell size since it allows the storage of multiple voltage levels in a single memory cell functioning as a multi-bit memory. When four levels are stored in a single memory cell, the effective cell size is halved. The authors show that a charge-coupling sense amplifier, charge-sharing restore, and time-shared sensing increase speed and reduce sense-circuit area for 4 Gb DRAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585267/","conferenceDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5602167","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 4-level storage 4 Gb DRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-level storage 4 Gb DRAM","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00585267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033772S","chronDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","isNumber":"12641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459","citationCount":"17","articleId":"585267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":585268,"authors":[{"name":"F.

To reduce the number of passive filters, recent highly integrated transceiver ICs tend to use single-conversion superhet architecture. The majority of the system gain in those transceivers are realized either at the IF frequency or at baseband. The baseband approach has the advantage of lower power consumption. A high gain IF amplifier, on the other hand, prevents offset and flicker noise from significantly degrading the signal. This IF amplifier is programmable from -20 dB to 60 dB in 2 dB steps. The amplifier is part of a CMOS RF transceiver IC. One of the challenges for this design is high gain at relatively high frequency, with associated stability problems. For the GSM handset, low power is a strong requirement. CMOS implementation involves additional design considerations. To minimize power consumption, the IF amplifier is realized as a chain of three amplifiers of the same configuration, so each amplifier's unity gain bandwidth is limited to around 700 MHz. The amplifier, with gain-programming logic, is fabricated in a 0.4 /spl mu/m CMOS process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2 mA/3 V 71 MHz IF amplifier in 0.4 /spl mu/m CMOS programmable over 80 dB range","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The device does not require external components and provides an output free of HF residues.","doi":"10.1109/4.585275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/12677/00585275.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.585275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic magnetic Hall sensor using dynamic quadrature offset cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585275/","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic magnetic Hall sensor using dynamic quadrature offset cancellation","volume":"32","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5605849","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic magnetic Hall sensor using dynamic quadrature offset cancellation","sourcePdf":"00585275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050319S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"86","articleId":"585275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585276,"authors":[{"name":"Wai Lee","affiliation":["Texas Instruments Inc, Dallas, TX, US"],"lastName":"Wai Lee","id":"37087640373"},{"name":"P.

At the same time, greater computational throughput is being required of the DSP, for example to implement more sophisticated speech and channel coding algorithms. Earlier low-power DSPs were reported. However, further improvements in power and performance are required. This paper describes a full-function, 1.6M-transistor, fixed-point programmable DSP designed for wireless communication applications to address these dual constraints of lower power and higher throughput. This is achieved by operating at 1V and using a dual-V process to maintain high performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The primary design goal is to minimize the power consumption so that the equalizer may be integrated into low-cost single-chip transceivers. Two 64-tap adaptive FIR filters are configured in parallel as in-phase and quadrature filters. Each has a span of l6T, where T is the symbol period, and is programmable to operate with T/2, T/3 or T/4 fractional spacing. On-chip programmable slicers enable slicing of up to 8x8 constellations. They use a reduced constellation for blind training and switch to the full constellation to obtain final convergence. The filters feature a zero latency cascadable systolic FIR structure that has the low power advantages of the direct form due to the reduced number of flip-flops in the output path, as well as the reduced critical path advantages of the transposed form. A programmable delay synchronizes the input data with the coefficients and the error for correct least mean squares (LMS) coefficient adaption with different fractional spacings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low power 128-tap digital adaptive equalizer for broadband modems","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The MF calculates a cross-correlation between an input signal and a filtering coefficient employed for modulation. Power consumption of the MF is a key issue for realizing multimedia hand-held terminals. Recently, a MF that uses analog signal processing has achieved a maximum processing rate of 25 MHz with 110 mW power consumption. Although this is a significant step toward the realization of a wideband CDMA, a considerable amount of improvement in processing rate is still required. Improvement is made in the processing rate without resorting to a scaled process.

The more compelling reason is the opportunities CMOS affords for large-scale integration. Modern wireless transceivers will increasingly blend digital blocks into conventional analog front-ends for frequency synthesis, adaptivity, multi-mode operation, and sophisticated detection. This raises questions such as how well digital CMOS circuits can co-exist on the same substrate as the radio front-end, or whether there is sufficient on-chip isolation in a low-cost package to guarantee stable operation of a receiver with more than 100 dB of baseband gain, or how the power amplifier modulates the on-chip local oscillator. The future of CMOS transceivers may well depend on satisfactory answers to these questions. This paper presents design techniques to mitigate these problems in a single-chip 900 MHz spread-spectrum transceiver implemented in 1 /spl mu/m CMOS, and measurements of the transceiver to validate their effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585283","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The newly developed delay circuit operates by amplifying the difference between the reference voltage and the capacitor voltage raised by the charging current which is proportional to the reference voltage. Linearity between the capacitor voltage swing and the driving current enables us to make the delay circuit supply voltage-, temperature-, and process-tolerant. Thus, the proposed delay circuit stably controls a programming pulse width through all operational ranges of supply voltage and temperature. The output frequency of the newly developed oscillator is inversely proportional to the supply voltage. This oscillator stably drives charge pump circuits which generate high programming voltages on chip since dependence of charge pump characteristics on frequency and supply voltage can be cancelled. As a result, the programming pulse generator including the delay circuit and the oscillator has reduced the total programming time under the slowest condition, i.e., high temperature and low voltage condition, by 30% and the power consumption under the fastest condition, i.e., low temperature and high voltage condition, by 20%, for a 3.3 V-only flash memory.","doi":"10.1109/4.585286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.585286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/12677/00585286.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stable programming pulse generator for single power supply flash memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A stable programming pulse generator for single power supply flash memories","volume":"32","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5598332","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stable programming pulse generator for single power supply flash memories","sourcePdf":"00585286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049655S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"14","articleId":"585286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":585287,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chang Wang","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Systems Laboratory Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Chang Wang","id":"37615883200"},{"name":"Jiin-Chuan Wu","affiliation":["Integrated Circuit and Systems Laboratory Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiin-Chuan Wu","id":"37335911000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"585287","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":55,"totalDownloads":3987},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585287","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge pumps","Switching frequency","Clocks","Power dissipation","CMOS technology","Degradation","Frequency conversion","Switching converters","Circuit optimization","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","DC-DC power convertors","automatic frequency control","circuit tuning","integrated circuit measurement","integrated circuit design","frequency convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","efficiency improvement","level shifter design","frequency converter","automatic switching frequency variation","dual charge pump circuit","inverting outputs","noninverting outputs","power efficiency","frequency tuning range","start-up circuit","latch-up avoidance","slow turn-on fast turn-off driving scheme","power dissipation","p-well double-poly single-metal CMOS technology","breakdown voltage","die size","clock buffer","dc-dc converting circuit","12 mA","100 Hz to 25 kHz","3 mum","18 V","17 V"]}],"abstract":"Conventional charge pump circuits use a fixed switching frequency that leads to power efficiency degradation for loading less than the rated loading. This paper proposes a level shifter design that also functions as a frequency converter to automatically vary the switching frequency of a dual charge pump circuit according to the loading. The switching frequency is designed to be 25 kHz with 12 mA loading on both inverting and noninverting outputs. The switching frequency is automatically reduced when loading is lighter to improve the power efficiency. The frequency tuning range of this circuit is designed to be from 100 Hz to 25 kHz. A start-up circuit is included to ensure proper pumping action and avoid latch-up during power-up. A slow turn-on, fast turn-off driving scheme is used in the clock buffer to reduce power dissipation. The new dual charge pump circuit was fabricated in a 3-/spl mu/m p-well double-poly single-metal CMOS technology with breakdown voltage of 18 V, the die size is 4.7/spl times/4.5 mm/sup 2/. For comparison, a charge pump circuit with conventional level shifter and clock buffer was also fabricated. The measured results show that the new charge pump has two advantages: (1) the power dissipation of the charge pump is improved by a factor of 32 at no load and by 2% at rated loading of 500 /spl Omega/ and (2) the breakdown voltage requirement is reduced from 19.2 to 17 V.","doi":"10.1109/4.585287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/12677/00585287.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.585287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency improvement in charge pump circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency improvement in charge pump circuits","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5598333","volume":"32","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency improvement in charge pump circuits","sourcePdf":"00585287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030552S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"97","articleId":"585287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585288,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This preserving circuit is not only three times faster than a conventional MTCMOS one, but it consumes half the power and takes up half the area.

This squarer had two additional features: increased number of squaring operations per unit circuit area and the potential for reduced power consumption per squaring operation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.585298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12677","startPage":"909","endPage":"912","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/12677/00585298.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast parallel squarer based on divide-and-conquer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A fast parallel squarer based on divide-and-conquer","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5598340","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast parallel squarer based on divide-and-conquer","sourcePdf":"00585298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027623S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"45","articleId":"585298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585304,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A straight flash-architecture would need 1023 accurate fast comparators. With a 2 V input range, a comparator offset voltage of no more than 1 mV can be tolerated. Taking into account that the 1 mV is a 3-6 sigma value, leads to a large chip. If, however, the signals to the comparator are amplified before the critical decision, simple small comparators would suffice. To cope with the dynamic offset caused by the clocking and latch action of the comparator itself, the architecture must tolerate comparator offsets of up to 60-80 mV. Hence, a gain of at least 30 is necessary. A single amplifier however, could not handle this, as the input range of 2 V would be amplified to 60 V. The approach here is to use a distributed amplifier.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Resistors","Impedance","CMOS digital integrated circuits","Clocks","Latches","Distributed amplifiers","Strips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","analogue-digital conversion","distributed amplifiers","comparators (circuits)5602188","cascade networks","interpolation","analogue-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample rate","comparator","CMOS ADC","dynamic offset voltage","clocking","latching","chip architecture","distributed amplifier","170 mW","10 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585304","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

This compares to about 0.5LSB DNL for slower 12b converters. The basic two-step flash architecture is shown. The /spl plusmn/0.25V input is amplified to /spl plusmn/1V and held in the track-and-hold circuit when the input clock rises. The 32 comparators in ADC1 produce an approximation that switches the 32 matched current sources in the main DAC. The residue is formed and amplified in the summer to /spl plusmn/0.5V and is converted by ADC2, an 8b folding-and-interpolating flash ADC. To allow low clock rates, there is no analog pipelining, and all analog settling from the track-to-hold transition to latching the result in ADC2 takes only 4.4ns. The ADC1 and ADC2 results added together form the 12b output. The total signal-to-data-output delay is slightly more than two cycles due to digital pipelining.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585305","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The number of bits resolved per stage is set higher to achieve the same resolution with less accurate components. Resolving more bits per stage greatly simplifies op amp design and reduces the initial capacitor matching requirement. Furthermore, residue amplifiers with low feedback factors are less sensitive to summing-node parasitics. The first two 5b stages are calibrated using the remaining part of the ADC. Two stages are selected for calibration. The gain ofthe 5b residue amplifier is set to 16 to make room for digital correction. After digital correction, the chip has an 18b output. Performance up to 16b level can be tested after removing 2 LSBs corrupted by digital processing.

Digitization of IF processing confers several important advantages, including greater reliability, potentially lower power consumption, and improved performance as technology scales. Unfortunately, as analog signal processing is eliminated and the A/D conversion is moved away from baseband, the signal that must be digitized has a larger dynamic range, and the converter must operate at a higher sampling rate. This work introduces a two-path, switched-capacitor architecture for a bandpass /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator that is suited to digitizing narrowband radio signals with large dynamic range. A fourth-order bandpass modulator is implemented in a standard 0.6 /spl mu/m, single-poly, triple-metal CMOS process.

Since most of the transistors on this merged chip will be devoted to memory, it is called 'intelligent RAM'. IRAM is attractive because the gigabit DRAM chip has enough transistors for both a powerful processor and a memory big enough to contain whole programs and data sets. It contains 1024 memory blocks each 1kb wide. It needs more metal layers to accelerate the long lines of 600mm/sup 2/ chips. It may require faster transistors for the high-speed interface of synchronous DRAM. Potential advantages of IRAM include lower memory latency, higher memory bandwidth, lower system power, adjustable memory width and size, and less board space. Challenges for IRAM include high chip yield given processors have not been repairable via redundancy, high memory retention rates given processors usually need higher power than DRAMs, and a fast processor given logic is slower in a DRAM process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585348/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5602228","conferenceDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent RAM (IRAM): chips that remember and compute","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent RAM (IRAM): chips that remember and compute","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00585348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057831S","chronDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","isNumber":"12641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459","citationCount":"69","articleId":"585348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585351,"authors":[{"name":"R.

I.McIC is a video encoder for this market, in particular for storage applications where higher bit rates can he tolerated (5-15 Mb/s) compared with bit rates for transmission (1.5-8 Mb/s). I.McIC operates in MPEG ML@SP mode and offers good video quality at 5 Mb/s and excellent quality at 10 Mb/s. For consumer storage applications, the video signals to be encoded might not be as clean as typical studio standards. Therefore, noise reduction is an integral part of I.McIC. I.McIC can share 16 Mb DRAM with an MPEG2 video decoder, organized as 4 times 4 Mb devices with 60 ns access. It can handle both 50 Hz and 60 Hz video sources. To interface to a video source, I.McIC uses a line-locked clock generated by the A/D converter and running at 27 MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The transceiver chipset for digital data transmission is realized on the 25 GHz bipolar Siemens B6HF process. The transmitter IC integrates the complete synthesizer including PLL, VCOs, frequency doubler, supply voltage regulation and supporting switching functions. Due to the open-loop architecture, the input impedance variation of the switched power amplifier results in frequency deviation of the VCO caused by load pulling. The required isolation can not be achieved within a single IC package. Previous solutions use an external discrete buffer stage. To increase the integration level, the buffer amplifier has been realized on the RX-IC. The advantage of this configuration is increased isolation due to the fully-differential setup. The chipset architecture is suitable for FSK digital mobile radio portable and base stations, especially cordless phone system from 1.6 GHz up to 2.5 GHz including DECT, wireless LAN, wireless local loop, 2.4 GHz ISM band frequency hopping system or any other system using FSK modulation. The TX design is optimized with respect to power supply, low current consumption, frequency stability and phase noise, whereas the RX-design is optimized for sensitivity and input intercept point simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585395","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

Heretofore, the complexity of a complete EPRML implementation has been deemed too high, and efforts have been directed primarily at approximating EPRML performance with modified PRML hardware. This channel IC combines extended class 4 partial response (EPR4) equalization with ML sequence detection based on the Viterbi algorithm. The EPR4 signal is well-matched to the typical readback signal in the range of normalized user densities of current and future interest, simplifying the equalizer. Anti-aliasing filtering and equalization are combined in a continuous-time filter, eliminating a FIR filter.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

Microprocessor clock frequencies are increasing faster than process technology performance improvement by reducing the number of gates between latches. This increases the ratio of flipflops or latches to logic gates, and together with the fact that approximately twice the number of logic gates are used with each new architecture, leads to significant increase in clock capacitive load and power. This trend also drives up the delay in distributing and buffering the clock around the microprocessor to more than 50% of the clock cycle. This work identifies and minimizes major contributions to jitter and skew in the complete clock generator that consists of a PLL operating with the distribution network, for a 203mm/sup 2/ 300MHz microprocessor.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585406","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The core loop is a first order DLL generating six edges evenly spaced by 30/spl deg/. The peripheral digital loop selects a pair of edges, /spl phi/ and /spl psi/, to interpolate.

The resulting edges, /spl phi/' and /spl psi/', drive a digitally-controlled interpolator that generates the main clock /spl Theta/. The interpolator quantization step is 2/spl deg/, i.e. 22ps for a 250MHz clock. This dual-loop architecture provides unlimited phase shift capability eliminating start-up issues and phase relationship constraints. The only requirement is that the DLL input clock and the reference clock are plesiochronous making this architecture suitable for clock-recovery applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585407","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

First, the supply voltage will go down from the present 5 V to 3 V and subsequently to 2 V, because the smaller dimensions result in a reduction of the breakdown voltage. Second, the circuit density possible increases. To meet the VLSI demands, compact topologies are needed that can operate on supply voltages between 1 and 2 V, depending on threshold voltages of the transistors. Existing CMOS opamps are compact but cannot operate at supply voltages below 2.5 V or otherwise have a complicated structure. The authors present a compact opamp which operates on supply voltage down to one gate-source voltage and two saturation voltages which amounts to 1.8 V. The opamp consists of two stages, an input stage and, a rail-to-rail output stage. An intermediate part contains current sources and a current mirror that sums the differential signals from the input stage and, cascodes that provide gain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1997.585413","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

It incorporates a plurality of differential pairs (DP) coupled in parallel, forming a transadmittance stage. The input of each DP is provided with the input signal voltage, shifted by an offset voltage. The offset voltage of each individual DP is variable and independent of other DP offsets. When all offset voltages are equal, the transadmittance stage is set to maximum gain. The linear input region is then comparable to that of a single DP transadmittance stage. When the offset voltages are made equidistant at about 40 to 60 mV, the transadmittance stage is set to minimum gain. The linear input range is then increased compared to the situation of maximum gain and is dependent on the number of DPs. Gain settings between minimum and maximum gain are achieved by values of equidistance of the offset voltages between 0 and 40 to 60 mV. A prototype variable gain amplifier is in a 1 /spl mu/m triple metal bipolar process. It contains 32 parallel DPs and has a differential voltage input as well as output. The gain range is 0 to 25 dB.

The theoretical limits are applied in order to specify the accuracy of a calibration procedure for broadband sampling oscilloscopes.","doi":"10.1109/19.585425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.585425","startPage":"660","endPage":"666","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/12679/00585425.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying the maximum phase-distortion error introduced by signal samplers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying the maximum phase-distortion error introduced by signal samplers","publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"46","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5598345","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585425/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying the maximum phase-distortion error introduced by signal samplers","sourcePdf":"00585425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022975S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"6","articleId":"585425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":585430,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

The architecture increases, by over an order of magnitude, the achievable data rate for the transmitter method, in which phase/frequency modulation is by dithering the divide value within a phase locked loop (PLL). This design avoids mixers and D/A converters to generate I and Q waveforms, so that simplicity and power savings are achieved. The system was built using a custom, CMOS fractional-N synthesizer that contains several key circuits. Included are an on-chip, continuous-time filter that requires no tuning or external components, a digital MASH /spl Sigma//spl delta/ converter that achieves low-power operation through pipelining, and a 64-modulus divider that supports any divide value between 32 and 63.5 in half cycle increments. Also included is a phase/frequency detector (PFD) that avoids dead-zone problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

The process features bipolar transistors with f/sub T/, and f/sub MAX/ values of 24 GHz and 38 GHz, respectively at V/sub CE/=1 V. The minimum noise figure, NF/sub MIN/, is typically 2 dB at 5.5 GHz, while BV/sub CEO/ and BV/sub CBO/ are 4.2 V, and 15 V, respectively. The three-layer metallization with 2 /spl mu/m thick Al top layer allows for fabrication of inductors with Qs in the 6-10 range and microstrip and coplanar lines with Qs of 6 at 26 GHz.

Its memory cell size has been more than 50% larger than those of single port SRAMs. Single bit-line read/write architectures are effective for area reduction. However, there are problems of operation reliability or slow speed. The port swap architecture realizes a small memory cell size without the problems. The cell size is reduced more than 24%. The color palette with this architecture is fabricated in a 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS process technology and operates up to 300 MHz.

This performance is achieved because of a hierarchical bit-line architecture that uses double global bit-line pairs (WGB), and a high-speed timing-free sense amplifier that shortens access time.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Read-write memory","Delay","Laboratories","High speed integrated circuits","Bandwidth","Cache memory","Reduced instruction set computing","Random access memory","Operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["macros","cache storage","two-port networks","CMOS memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-port macro","double global bit-line pairs","high-speed embedded cache memory","superscalar RISC processor","access time","cycle time","hierarchical architecture","sense amplifier","16 kB","2 ns","285 MHz"]}],"publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Solids-State Circuits Conference.

A pre-fetched pipeline scheme enables the cycle time for an internal memory core (I-cycle) to be extended by N times that of an external bus cycle (E-cycle). This is modified to an SRAM to achieve both 4b pipeline-burst cache operation and 500MHz I/O frequency. In this case, I-cycle time of 8ns is four times E-cycle time (2ns).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585461/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5609233","conferenceDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 500 MHz 4 Mb CMOS pipeline-burst cache SRAM with point-to-point noise reduction coding I/O","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 500 MHz 4 Mb CMOS pipeline-burst cache SRAM with point-to-point noise reduction coding I/O","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00585461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083037S","chronDate":"8-8 Feb. 1997","isNumber":"12641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459","citationCount":"7","articleId":"585461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":585485,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Lien Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Shun-Lien Chuang","id":"37087189291"},{"name":"A.

We have successfully fabricated the OPIC with a cutoff frequency of 18.4 MHz for 780 nm radiation and 21.1 MHz for 635 nm radiation. The development of the OPIC was made possible by the high-speed photodiode, which has n-type buried diffusion regions formed in the vicinity of the p-type buried isolation diffusion regions. An anti-reflection film is formed directly on the isolation region of the split photodiode as well as on the photodiode, therefore enhancing the sensitivity. The cutoff frequency of the photodiode thus realized is 24 MHz for 780 nm radiation and 41 MHz for 635 nm radiation and the reflection rate is lower than 3%. The OPIC is compatible with 12/spl times/ speed CD-ROM and DVD optical systems. We show the structure of this new device and its fabrication process. We found that the cutoff frequency of the photodiode is lower when the isolation region is irradiated than when the center region of the photodiode is irradiated. We studied the mechanism of the above difference of the cutoff frequency of the photodiode using device simulations.","doi":"10.1109/30.585534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.585534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/12689/00585534.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Si-OEIC (OPIC) for optical pickup","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5605999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Si-OEIC (OPIC) for optical pickup","sourcePdf":"00585534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045227S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"7","articleId":"585534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":585542,"authors":[{"name":"Myeong-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Corporate Technical Operations, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myeong-Hwan Lee","id":"37350512200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"585542","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSD filter design for VLSI implementation of GA-VSB receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585542","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Application specific integrated circuits","Quantization","Matched filters","Digital modulation","Frequency","CMOS technology","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["television receivers","digital filters","VLSI","digital phase locked loops","digital signal processing chips","application specific integrated circuits","high definition television","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","GA-VSB receiver","CSD filter design","Grand Alliance","vestigial sideband receiver","digital filter design","digital frequency lock loop","digital phase lock loop","canonic signed digit","single VLSI chip","performance evaluation","frequency characteristics","real coefficient filters","CSD code conversion","quantization","CSD filter","quantized coefficients","hardware structure","SEC STD60","ASIC","DFPLL","HDTV"]}],"abstract":"We present several filters for the Grand Alliance (GA) vestigial sideband (VSB) receiver.

The CSD code conversion is a class of quantization in which the filter coefficients are quantized. A filter represented by a CSD code is called the CSD filter. The quantized coefficients which are restricted to the set of representable numbers by and digit CSD code with 2 nonzero digit (L=2, M=7) are considered.

Since the ARMSA has a narrow bandwidth and high-input impedance, a parasitic element placed above the ARMSA is employed for not only obtaining a broadband characteristic, but decreasing the input impedance down to 50 /spl Omega/. A hybrid coupler to generate circular polarization, therefore, can be connected to the co-planar space of the ARMSA directly without a large-size matching circuit and a very low profile and simple structure can be achieved. The ARMSA is excited at the TM/sub 21/ mode to produce a conical pattern, which has a high gain in a low-elevation angle for mobile satellite communications. An effective design method using the equivalent circuit is indicated and, as a result, it is obvious that a broadband characteristic is obtained when each resonant frequency of the ARMSA and parasitic element is identical. Experimental results in the L-band showed satisfactory characteristics for vehicle antennas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An annular-ring microstrip antenna fed by a co-planar feed circuit for mobile satellite communication use","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.585748","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/12694/00585748.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.585748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"An annular-ring microstrip antenna fed by a co-planar feed circuit for mobile satellite communication use","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5625559","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An annular-ring microstrip antenna fed by a co-planar feed circuit for mobile satellite communication use","sourcePdf":"00585748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043986S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"28","articleId":"585748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585749,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

The authors next consider the estimation and filtering of high-frequency information in MR images, comprising noise, intertissue boundaries, and within tissue microstructures. The authors conclude that post-filtering is preferable to the prefiltering that has been proposed previously. The authors observe that the performance of any segmentation algorithm, in particular that of Wells et al. (and the authors' refinements of it) is affected substantially by the number and selection of the tissue classes that are modeled explicitly, the corresponding defining parameters and, critically, the spatial distribution of tissues in the image. The authors present an initial exploration to choose automatically the number of classes and the associated parameters that give the best output. This requires the authors to define what is meant by \"best output\" and for this they propose the application of minimum entropy. The methods developed have been implemented and are illustrated throughout on simulated and real data (brain and breast MR).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5617259","pubMedId":"9184886","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the bias field of MR images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the bias field of MR images","sourcePdf":"00585758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045095S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"228","articleId":"585758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585761,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Given a set of boundaries, motion computation involves first matching local segments on one contour to segments on the next contour in the sequence using a shape-based strategy. Results from the match process are incorporated with a smoothness term into an optimization functional. The global minimum of this functional is found, resulting in a smooth flow field that is consistent with the match data. The computation is performed for all pairs of frames in the temporal sequence and equally sampled points on one contour are tracked throughout the sequence, resulting in a composite flow field over the entire sequence. Two perspectives on characterizing the optimization functional are presented which result in a tradeoff resolved by the confidence in the initial boundary segmentation. Experimental results for contours derived from diagnostic image sequences of three different imaging modalities are presented. A comparison of trajectory estimates with trajectories of gold-standard markers implanted in the LV wall are presented for validation. The results of this comparison confirm that although cardiac motion is a three-dimensional (3-D) problem, two-dimensional (2-D) analysis provides a rich testing ground for algorithm development.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape-based tracking of left ventricular wall motion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.585761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/12695/00585761.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.585761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"Shape-based tracking of left ventricular wall motion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5617262","pubMedId":"9184889","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape-based tracking of left ventricular wall motion","sourcePdf":"00585761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08851S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"81","articleId":"585761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":585767,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The paper points to theoretical limitations of scanline algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/42.585769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.585769","startPage":"349","endPage":"361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/12695/00585769.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling concerns in scanline algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"Sampling concerns in scanline algorithms","publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5617270","pubMedId":"9184897","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585769/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling concerns in scanline algorithms","sourcePdf":"00585769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037374S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"2","articleId":"585769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":585771,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

In communication systems, this usually, but not always, means attempting to reduce the variance of the bit error rate (BER) estimator. By reducing the variance, IS estimators can achieve a given precision from shorter simulation runs; hence the term \"quick simulation.\" The idea behind IS is that certain values of the input random variables in a simulation have more impact on the parameter being estimated than others. If these \"important\" values are emphasized by sampling more frequently, then the estimator variance can be reduced. Hence, the basic methodology in IS is to choose a distribution which encourages the important values. This use of a \"biased\" distribution will, of course, result in a biased estimator if applied directly in the simulation. However, there is a simple procedure whereby the simulation outputs are weighted to correct for the use of the biased distribution, and this ensures that the new IS estimator is unbiased. Hence, the \"art\" of designing quick simulations via IS is entirely dependent on the choice of biased distribution. Over the last 50 years, IS techniques have flourished, but it is only in the last decade that coherent design methods have emerged. The outcome of these developments is that at the expense of increasing technical content, modern techniques can offer substantial run-time saving for a very broad range of problems. We present a comprehensive history and survey of IS methods. In addition, we offer a guide to the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques, and hence indicate which techniques are suitable for various types of communications systems. We stress that simple approaches can still yield useful savings, and so the simulation practitioner as well as the technical researcher should consider IS as a possible simulation tool.","doi":"10.1109/49.585771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.585771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/12696/00585771.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quick simulation: a review of importance sampling techniques in communications systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Quick simulation: a review of importance sampling techniques in communications systems","volume":"15","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5611025","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585771/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quick simulation: a review of importance sampling techniques in communications systems","sourcePdf":"00585771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109006S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"191","articleId":"585771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":585772,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

It is shown that under the same mean-squared error condition, the number of terms required by the truncated K-L expansion is less than that of the series expansion obtained by using the discrete-path approximation of the channel so that simulation using the K-L expansion is more efficient. This computational advantage becomes more significant as higher simulation accuracy is required.

Most of the recommended OQPSK-type schemes-also called MSK-type schemes-jointly exhibit the following features: a constant envelope or, at least, a low envelope fluctuation; a compact spectrum after a power-efficient, saturated amplifier, and a high detection efficiency obtained with simple, low-cost receivers. We introduce a novel approach to computer-aided modeling of OQPSK-type digital transmission over nonlinear radio channels. By taking into account the specific nature of OQPSK-type modulations, when using the Volterra approach as proposed by Benedetto et al. (1987), we conclude that two signal representations (\"parallel\" and \"serial\") can be achieved which are similar to the conventional Laurent (1986) representation of binary CPM signals with h=1/2. With the proposed approach, the OQPSK-type signals have an invariant structure along the transmission path (which is supposed to include, at least, one nonlinearity) in the sense that they are all made of several linear components of the same type. Some examples are given, including signal representation and power spectrum results. The proposed unified signal representations can be very useful for design and performance evaluation of radio communication systems (mobile and/or satellite applications). They combine flexibility, accuracy, and simplicity, and allow high computational efficiencies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/12696/00585775.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.585775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.585775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach to modeling of OQPSK-type digital transmission over nonlinear radio channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal representations","Digital modulation","Satellite communication","Fluctuations","High power amplifiers","Envelope detectors","Receivers","Signal design","Radio communication","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","digital radio","quadrature phase shift keying","satellite communication","telecommunication computing","computer aided analysis","signal representation","minimum shift keying","signal detection","radiofrequency amplifiers","amplifiers","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OQPSK type digital transmission","nonlinear radio channels","offset quaternary PSK","digital modulation","radio transmission systems","nonlinear amplifiers","land mobile communications","satellite communications","constant envelope","compact spectrum","power efficient saturated amplifier","high detection efficiency","low cost receivers","computer-aided modeling","Volterra approach","parallel signal representation","serial signal representation","binary CPM signals","Laurent representation","performance evaluation","computational efficiency","unified signal representation","power spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to modeling of OQPSK-type digital transmission over nonlinear radio channels","volume":"15","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5611029","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to modeling of OQPSK-type digital transmission over nonlinear radio channels","sourcePdf":"00585775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046218S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","articleId":"585775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":585778,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We discuss the extension of this approach to the computer-aided modeling, analysis, and design (CAMAD) of these communication links.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Optical noise","High speed optical techniques","Nonlinear optics","Optical transmitters","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical distortion","Signal analysis","Computer errors","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre communication","intersymbol interference","error statistics","digital communication","telecommunication computing","computer aided analysis","CAD","digital simulation","software tools","fibre lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error rate patterns","optically amplified transmission systems","simulation tool","photonically amplified digital links","EDFA","system performance","intersymbol interference","laser nonlinearities","signal dependent noise","worst case patterns","computational metrics","performance evaluation","experimental environment","generalised eye diagram concept","computer-aided modeling","computer-aided analysis","computer-aided design","communication links","erbium doped fibre amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/49.585781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/12696/00585781.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.585781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-rate patterns for the modeling of optically amplified transmission systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error-rate patterns for the modeling of optically amplified transmission systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585781/","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5611035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-rate patterns for the modeling of optically amplified transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00585781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040357S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","articleId":"585781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":585782,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

These requirements include the simulation of the statistical variation in component parameters, timing skew, and crosstalk. Due to the required simulation of statistical variation in component parameters, a time efficient simulation approach such as the quasi-analytical simulation methodology is vital. In addition, the adoption of a block-oriented simulation environment facilitates mixed-level simulation which minimizes the computational requirements of the bus simulation while achieving the required accuracy in the simulation of all bus components. Simulation results indicate that while noise is not a limiting factor in the performance of the optical bus, timing skew, and device uniformity across the channels of the bus are the most important factors for satisfactory performance.

Asymptotic approximations and bounds, used for system bit-error probabilities, seldom capture the sensitivities of the system performance. We develop single-run gradient estimation methods for such optical CDMA systems using a discrete-event dynamic systems (DEDS) approach. Specifically, computer-aided techniques such as infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) and likelihood ratio (LR) methods are used for analyzing the sensitivity of the average BER to a wide class of system parameters. It is shown that the above formulation is equally applicable to time-encoded and frequency-encoded systems. Further, the estimates derived are unbiased, and also optimality of the variance of these estimates is shown via the theory of common random variates and importance sampling techniques.","doi":"10.1109/49.585783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/12696/00585783.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.585783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient estimation for stochastic optimization of optical code-division multiple-access systems .I.

We develop infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA)-based stochastic gradient algorithms for deriving optimum detectors with the average probability of bit error being the objective function that is minimized. Specifically, we develop both a class of linear as well as nonlinear (threshold) detectors. In the linear scheme, the receiver despreads the received optical signal with a sequence that minimizes the average bit-error rate. In the case of the threshold detector, the detection threshold for the photoelectron count is optimized to achieved minimum average bit-error rate. These algorithms use maximum likelihood estimates of the multiple access interference based on observations of the photoelectron counts during each bit interval, and alleviate the disadvantage of previously proposed schemes that require explicit knowledge of the interference statistics. Computer-aided implementations of the detectors derived are shown to outperform the correlation detector. Sequential implementations of the adaptive detectors that require no preamble are also developed, and make them very viable detectors for systems subject to temporal variations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient estimation for stochastic optimization of optical code-division multiple-access systems.

When implemented as a test chip or drop-in pattern for MEMS processes, M-Test becomes analogous to the electrical MOSFET test structures (often called E-Test) used for extraction of MOS device parameters. The principle of M-Test is the electrostatic pull-in of three sets of test structures [cantilever beams (CB's), fixed-fixed beams (FB's), and clamped circular diaphragms (CD's)] followed by the extraction of two intermediate quantities (the S and B parameters) that depend on the product of material properties and test structure geometry. The S and B parameters give a direct measure of the process uniformity across an individual wafer and process repeatability between wafers and lots. The extraction of material properties (e.g., Young's modulus, plate modulus, and residual stress) from these S and B parameters is then accomplished using geometric metrology data. Experimental demonstration of M-Test is presented using results from MIT's dielectrically isolated wafer-bonded silicon process. This yielded silicon plate modulus results which agreed with literature values to within /spl plusmn/4%. Guidelines for adapting the method to other MEMS process technologies are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/12697/00585788.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"118","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/84.585788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.585788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-TEST: A test chip for MEMS material property measurement using electrostatically actuated test structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Materials testing","Micromechanical devices","Material properties","Semiconductor device measurement","Electrostatic measurements","Structural beams","Silicon","System testing","Microelectromechanical systems","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromechanical devices","electrostatic devices","mechanical testing","mechanical variables measurement","microactuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-TEST","test chip","MEMS material property measurement","microelectromechanical system","electrostatically actuated test structure","process monitoring","process development","manufacturing","drop-in pattern","pull-in voltage","clamped circular diaphragm","cantilever beam","fixed-fixed beam","B parameter","S parameter","process uniformity","process repeatability","Young modulus","plate modulus","residual stress","geometric metrology","dielectrically isolated wafer-bonded silicon process","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"M-TEST: A test chip for MEMS material property measurement using electrostatically actuated test structures","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5613106","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-TEST: A test chip for MEMS material property measurement using electrostatically actuated test structures","sourcePdf":"00585788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057374S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"578","articleId":"585788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585794,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These converters make use of several switches connected in a series, which allows using switches with reduced voltage ratings; these low voltage switches have lower conduction losses and can switch at higher frequency. In addition to this feature common to all converters using series connected switches, the control signals of multilevel converters can be phase shifted to increase the apparent switching frequency and improve the dynamic performances of the whole converter. It is shown that a multilevel inverter leg, composed of p pairs of switches and p-1 capacitors, forms a multivariable nonlinear system that cannot be properly modeled by standard methods such as state-space averaging. The transient behavior of this system depends on the current harmonics and their phase shift with the different control signals. A specific model is detailed, studied, and used to illustrate the properties of these converters. In particular, the natural balancing of the voltage across the switches is demonstrated and the time constants involved in this process are determined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of multilevel converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.585833","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/12700/00585833.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.585833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of multilevel converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5610639","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of multilevel converters","sourcePdf":"00585833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022591S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"286","articleId":"585833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":585834,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Then, the observed disturbance torque is fed forward, to increase the robustness of the synchronous motor drive.","doi":"10.1109/41.585839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.585839","endPage":"407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/12700/00585839.pdf","startPage":"398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time IP position controller design with torque feedforward control for PM synchronous motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585839/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time IP position controller design with torque feedforward control for PM synchronous motor","volume":"44","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5610644","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time IP position controller design with torque feedforward control for PM synchronous motor","sourcePdf":"00585839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084892S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"97","articleId":"585839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585840,"authors":[{"name":"Shiuh-Jer Huang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shiuh-Jer Huang","id":"37087215014"},{"name":"Ruey-Jing Lian","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ruey-Jing Lian","id":"37088052862"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"585840","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585840","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Neural networks","Robot motion","Service robots","Manipulator dynamics","Mathematical model","Control systems","Couplings","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Electrical equipment industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","neurocontrollers","fuzzy control","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","multivariable control systems","motion control","manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid fuzzy logic","neural network algorithm","robot motion control","robotic manipulators","multivariable nonlinear coupling dynamic systems","nonlinear mathematical models","control systems","multi-input/multi-output system","MIMO robotic system","4-degree-of-freedom robot","neural network controller","coupling effect","robot joints","trajectory tracking precision"]}],"doi":"10.1109/41.585840","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/12700/00585840.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"408","endPage":"417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.585840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid fuzzy logic and neural network algorithm for robot motion control","abstract":"Robotic manipulators are multivariable nonlinear coupling dynamic systems. Industrial robots were controlled by using a traditional controller, the control performance of which may change with respect to operating conditions. Since the robotic manipulators have complicated nonlinear mathematical models, control systems based on the system model are difficult to design. In this paper, a model-free hybrid fuzzy logic and neural network algorithm was proposed to control this multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) robotic system. First, a fuzzy logic controller was designed to control individual joints of this 4-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot. Secondly, a coupling neural network controller was introduced to take care of the coupling effect among joints and refine the control performance of this robotic system. The experimental results showed that the application of this control strategy effectively improved the trajectory tracking precision.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5610645","volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid fuzzy logic and neural network algorithm for robot motion control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid fuzzy logic and neural network algorithm for robot motion control","sourcePdf":"00585840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051575S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"15","articleId":"585840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":585843,"authors":[{"name":"Tsai-Fu Wu","affiliation":["Power Electronics Applied Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsai-Fu Wu","id":"37087142644"},{"name":"Jin-Chyuan Hung","affiliation":["Power Electronics Applied Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Chyuan Hung","id":"37087398943"},{"name":"Te-Hung Yu","affiliation":["Power Electronics Applied Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Te-Hung Yu","id":"37087289765"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"585843","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SPICE","Frequency","Circuit simulation","Equations","Fluorescent lamps","Electronic ballasts","Hysteresis","Oscillators","Computational modeling","Electric variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discharge lamps","lamp accessories","SPICE","software packages","circuit analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-pressure gaseous discharge lamps","PSpice circuit model","electrical characteristics","high-frequency operation","two-parameter equation","computer simulation","electronic dimming ballasts","preliminary design"]}],"abstract":"A simple, but accurate, PSpice circuit model simulating the electrical characteristics of low-pressure gaseous discharge lamp operating at high frequency is proposed.

The first depends upon inhomogeneities in the applied electrical field strength and upon the in-phase part of the resultant dipole moment induced in the particle and can be identified with the conventional dielectrophoretic (cDEP) force. The second relates to nonuniformities in the phase distribution of the applied field and to the out-of-phase part of the induced dipole moment. A nonuniform phase distribution corresponds to a field that travels through space. This second force component gives rise to traveling-wave dielectrophoresis (twDEP). In this paper, we describe several electrode configurations designed to produce electric fields capable of inducing cDEP and twDEP forces for the purpose of manipulating particles. Using DS19 Friend murine erythroleukemia cells as test particles having well-characterized dielectric properties, we investigated the electrokinetic behaviors for these electrodes as a function of frequency and electrode excitation mode. Several characteristic cell electrokinetic behaviors were identified, including trapping, linear motion, levitation, and circulation of the cells, depending on the excitation characteristics of the electrodes and the cell dielectric properties. We describe these findings and rationalize them in terms of the field distributions produced by the electrodes, the particle dielectric properties, and generalized dielectrophoresis theory. The biotechnological applications of dielectrophoretic manipulation are then discussed.","doi":"10.1109/28.585855","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"660","endPage":"669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/12701/00585855.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.585855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectrophoretic manipulation of particles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectrophoresis","Electrodes","Cells (biology)","Dielectrics","Microelectrodes","Cancer","Electric fields","Nonuniform electric fields","Electrokinetics","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrophoresis","electrokinetic effects","electric fields","cellular transport","microelectrodes","electric moments","bioelectric phenomena","biological effects of fields","biotechnology","biological techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectrophoretic manipulation","particles manipulation","dielectrophoretic force","traveling-wave dielectrophoresis","conventional dielectrophoresis","dipoole moment","nonuniform phase distribution","electrode configurations","DS19 Friend murine erythroleukemia cells","electric fields","dielectric properties","electrokinetic behaviors","electrode excitation mode","frequency","trapping","linear motion","levitation","cells circulation","field distributions","biotechnological applications","microelectrode design","electric field strength"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Dielectrophoretic manipulation of particles","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5598520","publicationDate":"May-June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585855/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectrophoretic manipulation of particles","sourcePdf":"00585855.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062883S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1997","isNumber":"12701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"83","articleId":"585855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585856,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.C.

For example, MDA-231 human breast cancer cells were found to have a mean plasma membrane specific capacitance of 26 mF/m/sup 2/, more than double the value (11 mF/m/sup 2/) observed for resting T-lymphocytes. When an inhomogeneous AC electric field is applied to a particle, a dielectrophoretic (DEP) force arises that depends on the particle dielectric properties. Therefore, cells having different dielectric characteristics will experience differential DEP forces when subjected to such a field. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of differential DEP forces for the separation of several different cancerous cell types from blood in a dielectric affinity column. These separations were accomplished using thin, flat chambers having microelectrode arrays on the bottom wall, DEP forces generated by the application of AC fields to the electrodes were used to influence the rate of elution of cells from the chamber by hydrodynamic forces within a parabolic fluid flow profile. Electrorotation measurements were first made on the various cell types found within cell mixtures to be separated, and theoretical modeling was used to derive the cell dielectric parameters. Optimum separation conditions were then predicted from the frequency and suspension conductivity dependencies of cell DEP responses defined by these parameters. Cell separations were then undertaken for various ratios of cancerous to normal cells at different concentrations, fluted cells were characterized in terms of separation efficiency, cell viability, and separation speed. For example, 100% efficiency was achieved for purging MDA-231 cells from blood at the tumor to normal cell ratio 1:1/spl times/10/sup 5/ or 1:3/spl times/10/sup 5/, cell viability was not compromised, and separation rates were at least 10/sup 3/ cells/s. Theoretical and experimental criteria for the design and operation of such separators are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1997","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1997","accessionNumber":"5598521","pubMedId":"20011619","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Dielectrophoretic separation of cancer cells from blood","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectrophoretic separation of cancer cells from blood","sourcePdf":"00585856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042035S","chronDate":"May-June  1997","isNumber":"12701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"288","articleId":"585856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":585865,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Zheng Peng","affiliation":["Engineering Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Fang Zheng Peng","id":"37278944800"},{"name":"Jih-Sheng Lai","affiliation":["The Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Power ElectronicsCenter, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Jih-Sheng Lai","id":"37274695000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"585865","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":201,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1651},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Pulse width modulation inverters","Control systems","Pulse width modulation","Transformers","Voltage control","Static VAr compensators","Power system simulation","Power system control","Bridge circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static VAr compensators","invertors","bridge circuits","switching circuits","feedback","feedforward","reactive power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward control decoupling","feedback control decoupling","static VAr generator","cascade multilevel inverters","dynamic performance","static VAr compensator","single-phase full bridges","separate DC source","almost sinusoidal waveform voltage","line-to-line voltage waveform","60-pulse inverter","fast response"]}],"abstract":"A cascade multilevel inverter is proposed for static VAr compensation/generation applications.

The method is illustrated using a block-wave oscillator and involves placing a pickup winding in a square indentation in the center leg of an E-core. Incorporating an air gap, a high-reluctance path is created at the area of the indentation. The remaining area saturates first and forces flux through the high-reluctance path, which induces a voltage on the pickup winding. The method was tested experimentally, and a proposed mathematical model was used to simulate the magnetic behavior of the sensor. Experimental and simulated results are presented and compared to verify the discussed operation. Although similar strategies have been reported previously, the significance of the sensor introduced in this paper is that detection takes place before saturation occurs and the sensor is integrated in the core.","doi":"10.1109/28.585868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.585868","endPage":"779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/12701/00585868.pdf","startPage":"774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sensor for balancing flux in converters with a high-frequency transformer link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585868/","displayDocTitle":"A sensor for balancing flux in converters with a high-frequency transformer link","volume":"33","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5598533","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sensor for balancing flux in converters with a high-frequency transformer link","sourcePdf":"00585868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023535S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1997","isNumber":"12701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"18","articleId":"585868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585876,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The model incorporates dynamics of the forming process, like turbulence, drainage speed, and preferential drainage through earlier less-dense regions and fiber properties, like propensity to clump, or \"flocculate,\" fiber flexibility, and concentration of fibers in the suspension. Results for monofiber layer structures are described, showing effects of turbulence and its decay during drainage in causing clumping, or \"flocculation.\" The commercial process has, as one of its main goals, the reduction to tolerable levels of the nonuniformity in mass distribution resulting from flocculation. The new model yields data corresponding to that obtainable along arbitrary scanning lines in planar stochastic fibrous structures, providing profiles, variances, histograms of local areal density, and histograms of local free-fiber lengths. These results closely resemble experimental data from commercial paper samples obtained from radiographic or optical transmission images subjected to image analysis.","doi":"10.1109/28.585876","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/12701/00585876.pdf","startPage":"826","endPage":"839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.585876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network model for paper-forming process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Neural network model for paper-forming process","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5598541","publicationDate":"May-June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network model for paper-forming process","sourcePdf":"00585876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065701S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1997","isNumber":"12701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"4","articleId":"585876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":585885,"authors":[{"name":"Jinfeng Kang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jinfeng Kang","id":"37087151901"},{"name":"Ruqi Han","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ruqi Han","id":"37087203754"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyan Liu","id":"37087152905"},{"name":"Yangyuan Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yangyuan Wang","id":"37087158976"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"585885","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585885","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Yttrium barium copper oxide","Temperature distribution","Packaging","Surface impedance","Crystals","Superconducting thin films","Frequency","Attenuation","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superconducting interconnections","integrated circuit interconnections","VLSI","superconducting integrated circuits","integrated circuit packaging","yttrium compounds","barium compounds","high-temperature superconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagation characteristics","high-T/sub c/ superconducting interconnect","generalized two-fluid model","surface impedance","single crystal","thin film","attenuation constant","transient response","pulse transmission","rise time","YBCO","VLSI packaging","YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/"]}],"doi":"10.1109/77.585885","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/12702/00585885.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.585885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation characteristics of high-T/sub c/ superconducting interconnect for VLSI packaging predicted by a generalized two-fluid model","abstract":"A generalized two-fluid model is used to analyze the propagation characteristics of high-Tc superconducting interconnects for very large scale integration (VLSI) packaging.

Three microstrip couplers are integrated to form a one-to-four BFN. An experimental prototype is fabricated with TlBaCaCuO thin film deposited onto LaAlO/sub 3/ substrate. Power handling capability of related HTS components such as line, bend, and BFN are also studied together with third-order intermodulation characteristics. It is shown that theoretical prediction is consistent with experimental results, presenting insertion loss of the four output ports ranging from 6.1-6.4 dB and return loss better than 14 dB at 11.95 GHz. These preliminary results demonstrate the potential of extending such a power divider technique in designing an N-port BFN. It is also indicated that the proposed HTS BFN scheme can offer advantages compared to its conventional counterpart, namely, a significant reduction in size/weight and low power loss.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5607805","displayDocTitle":"High-temperature superconducting beam forming network for communication system applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-temperature superconducting beam forming network for communication system applications","sourcePdf":"00585886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058021S","chronDate":"March  1997","isNumber":"12702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"6","articleId":"585886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":585888,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A general framework is introduced in this paper for the self-calibration of parallel manipulators. The concept of creating forward and inverse measurement residuals by exploring conflicting information provided with redundant sensing is proposed. Some of these ideas have been widely used for robot calibration when robot end-effector poses are available. By this treatment, many existing kinematic parameter estimation techniques can be applied for the self-calibration of parallel mechanisms. It is illustrated through a case study, i.e. calibration of the Stewart platform, that with this framework the design of a suitable self-calibration system and the formulation of the relevant mathematical model become more systematic. A few principles important to the system self-calibration are also demonstrated through the case study. It is shown that by installing a number of redundant sensors on the Stewart platform, the system is able to perform self-calibration. The approach provides a tool for rapid and autonomous calibration of the parallel mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/70.585901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/12704/00585901.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.585901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-calibration of parallel mechanisms with a case study on Stewart platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Self-calibration of parallel mechanisms with a case study on Stewart platforms","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5612546","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-calibration of parallel mechanisms with a case study on Stewart platforms","sourcePdf":"00585901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03495S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"156","articleId":"585901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585902,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Analog waveform compensation has the advantage of reducing out-of-band spectral emissions with respect to end-to-end digital predistortion, in addition to its easy realization. Nevertheless, it has been often neglected in the literature because of its lack of adaptivity; we propose making the predistorter fully adaptive. Different control schemes applied to fifth-order IF predistortion with different optimization criteria have been investigated. A simulation-based analysis shows that adaptive IF compensation achieves excellent performance if compared with static predistortion of the same order. Comparisons with upper bounds related to digital predistortion with memory, moreover, denote that IF analog predistortion can be truly considered an alternative approach, especially for narrow pulse shaping.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.585917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12705/00585917.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"428","doi":"10.1109/26.585917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of different optimization criteria for IF predistortion in digital radio links with nonlinear amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of different optimization criteria for IF predistortion in digital radio links with nonlinear amplifiers","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5605961","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of different optimization criteria for IF predistortion in digital radio links with nonlinear amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00585917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040425S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","articleId":"585917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":585919,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The codec obtains higher lossless compression of continuous-tone images than other lossless image coding techniques in the literature. This high coding efficiency is accomplished with relatively low time and space complexities. The CALIC puts heavy emphasis on image data modeling. A unique feature of the CALIC is the use of a large number of modeling contexts (states) to condition a nonlinear predictor and adapt the predictor to varying source statistics. The nonlinear predictor can correct itself via an error feedback mechanism by learning from its mistakes under a given context in the past. In this learning process, the CALIC estimates only the expectation of prediction errors conditioned on a large number of different contexts rather than estimating a large number of conditional error probabilities. The former estimation technique can afford a large number of modeling contexts without suffering from the context dilution problem of insufficient counting statistics as in the latter approach, nor from excessive memory use. The low time and space complexities are also attributed to efficient techniques for forming and quantizing modeling contexts.","doi":"10.1109/26.585919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12705/00585919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.585919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12705","startPage":"437","endPage":"444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-based, adaptive, lossless image coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Context-based, adaptive, lossless image coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5605963","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-based, adaptive, lossless image coding","sourcePdf":"00585919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04907S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"694","articleId":"585919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585921,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Unlike in spread-spectrum multiple-access systems where the different users necessarily share the same channel, cochannel interference is a severe hindrance to frequency- and time-division multiple-access communications, and is typically minimized by interference rejection/suppression techniques. Rather than using interference suppression, we are interested in the joint estimation of the information-bearing narrow-band cochannel signals. Novel joint estimators are proposed that employ a single-input demodulator with oversampling to compensate for timing uncertainties. Assuming finite impulse-response channel characteristics, maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) criteria are used to derive cochannel detectors of varying complexities and degrees of performance. In particular, a (suboptimal) two-stage joint MAP symbol detector (JMAPSD) is introduced that has a lower complexity than the single-stage estimators while accruing only a marginal loss in error-rate performance at high signal-to-interference ratios. Assuming only reliable estimates of the primary and secondary signal powers, a blind adaptive JMAPSD algorithm for a priori unknown channels is also derived. The performance of these nonlinear joint estimation algorithms is studied through example computer simulations for two cochannel sources.","doi":"10.1109/26.585923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/12705/00585923.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.585923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12705","startPage":"473","endPage":"484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear techniques for the joint estimation of cochannel signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear techniques for the joint estimation of cochannel signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5605967","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear techniques for the joint estimation of cochannel signals","sourcePdf":"00585923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087746S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"74","articleId":"585923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":585925,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Pin Lee","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Pin Lee","id":"37351494200"},{"name":"Thou-Ho Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Nan-Tai College, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Thou-Ho Chen","id":"37348332000"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"},{"name":"Mei-Juan Chen","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mei-Juan Chen","id":"37280978400"},{"name":"Chung-Wei Ku","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Wei Ku","id":"37357505300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"585925","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":335},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cost-effective architecture for 8/spl times/8 two-dimensional DCT/IDCT using direct method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Computer architecture","HDTV","Two dimensional displays","Discrete transforms","Image coding","Video coding","TV","Computational complexity","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","inverse problems","VLSI","parallel architectures","image coding","transform coding","digital signal processing chips","parallel algorithms","computational complexity","video coding","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-effective architecture","rotation technique","direct method","2D DCT/IDCT architecture","discrete cosine transform","inverse discrete cosine transform","computational complexity reduction","complex number","folded architecture","parallel architecture","regular architecture","VLSI","row-column method","internal wordlength","error requirement","throughput","image compression","transform techniques","image coding","video coding","high-definition television","HDTV"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585925","abstract":"Among the various transform techniques for image compression, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is the most popular and effective one in practical image and video coding applications, such as high-definition television (HDTV).

We describe an alternative approach wherein the compressed stream is processed in the compressed, discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain without explicit decompression and spatial domain processing, so that the output compressed stream, corresponding to the output image, conforms to the standard syntax of 8/spl times/8 blocks. We propose computation schemes for downsampling and for inverse motion compensation that are applicable to any DCT-based compression method. Worst case estimates of computation savings vary between 37% and 50% depending on the task. For typically sparse DCT blocks, the reduction in computations is more dramatic. A by-product of the proposed approach is improvement in arithmetic precision.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast algorithms for DCT-domain image downsampling and for inverse motion compensation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.585926","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/12715/00585926.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.585926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast algorithms for DCT-domain image downsampling and for inverse motion compensation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5613019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast algorithms for DCT-domain image downsampling and for inverse motion compensation","sourcePdf":"00585926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02901S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"112","articleId":"585926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585927,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The very high bandwidth is the fundamental limitation to the feasibility of those high pixel rate sensors and processing systems. Conditional replenishment is employed for the compression algorithm.

The side match criterion takes advantage of the spatial contiguity and interpixel correlation of image to select the best-fit replacement among the motion vectors of spatially contiguous candidate blocks.

However, when the number of hydrophones is large, integration times must be long enough to give accurate cross-spectral matrix (CSM) estimates, but short enough so that the dynamic behavior of the noise described by the CSM is captured. The dominant mode rejection (DMR) beamformer calculates adaptive weights based on a reduced rank CSM estimate, where the CSM estimate is formed with a subset of the largest eigenvalues and their eigenvectors. Since the largest eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs are estimated rapidly, the integration time required is reduced. The purpose of this study was to examine the DMR beamformer performance using a bottom-mounted horizontal line array in a shallow-water environment. The data were processed with a fully adaptive beamformer and the DMR beamformer. The DMR beamformer showed better performance than the fully adaptive beamformer when using arrays with larger numbers of hydrophones. Thus, in highly dynamic noise environments, the DMR beamformer may be a more appropriate implementation to use for passive sonar detection systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","volume":"22","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5611822","publicationDate":"April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the dominant mode rejection beamformer using reduced integration times","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the dominant mode rejection beamformer using reduced integration times","sourcePdf":"00585957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025811S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"12","articleId":"585957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":585958,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

A new application is proposed herein for capturing and processing underwater video onboard an untethered AUV, then transmitting it to a remote platform using acoustic telemetry. Since video communication requires a considerably larger bandwidth than that provided by an underwater acoustic channel, the data must be massively compressed prior to transmission from the AUV. Past research has shown that the low contrast and low-detailed nature of underwater imagery allows for low-bit-rate coding of the data by wavelet-based image-coding algorithms. In this work, these findings have been extended to the design of a wavelet-based hybrid video encoder which employs entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) with overlapped block-based motion compensation. The ECVQ codebooks were designed from a statistical source model which describes the distribution of high subband wavelet coefficients in both intraframe and prediction error images. Results indicate that good visual quality can be achieved for very low bit-rate coding of underwater video with our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/48.585958","startPage":"393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/12716/00585958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.585958","endPage":"400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-bit-rate coding of underwater video using wavelet-based compression algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Low-bit-rate coding of underwater video using wavelet-based compression algorithms","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5611823","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-bit-rate coding of underwater video using wavelet-based compression algorithms","sourcePdf":"00585958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034693S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"31","articleId":"585958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":585976,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A 40 GHz 4-stage distributed amplifier MMIC is constructed using one of the developed schemes and its performance is discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.585976","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12726/00585976.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"797 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.585976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The distributed amplifier as a signal processor for very high speed communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"The distributed amplifier as a signal processor for very high speed communication systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5684000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/585976/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The distributed amplifier as a signal processor for very high speed communication systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00585976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029322S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"1","articleId":"585976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":585986,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Nan","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hua Nan","id":"37087594666"},{"name":"Zemin Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zemin Liu","id":"37087167110"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3336-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"585986","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=585986","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Asynchronous transfer mode","Switches","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Optimal scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Telecommunication switching","B-ISDN","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication channels","scheduling","Hopfield neural nets","delays","packet switching","telecommunication computing","B-ISDN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network method","ATM multicast switch","neural network scheduling","neural network energy function","neural network scheduling algorithm","neural network controller","B-ISDN","cyclic-priority input access method","simulation results","delay-throughput performance","Hopfield neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.585986","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12726/00585986.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","startPage":"845","endPage":"848 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.585986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An neural network method ATM multicast switch","abstract":"A new method of neural network scheduling ATM multicast switch is given.

A multichannel linear equalization approach is taken, and we propose to adjust the equalizer coefficients with a blind adaptive algorithm (without the use of training data). This multiuser constant modulus algorithm (MU-CMA) is derived from the minimization of a cost function that penalizes deviations of the equalized signals from the constant modulus property as well as cross-correlations between them. The proposed scheme appears to be an appealing technique for multiuser blind equalization that combines good convergence properties with low computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constant modulus algorithm for multiuser signal separation in presence of delay spread using antenna arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/97.586042","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/97/12718/00586042.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.586042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=586042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/586042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"A constant modulus algorithm for multiuser signal separation in presence of delay spread using antenna arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5610217","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constant modulus algorithm for multiuser signal separation in presence of delay spread using antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00586042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069405S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"155","articleId":"586042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":586043,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Hence, it requires many computations and a large memory capacity. The use of parallel machines is a solution in order to reduce significantly the synthesis time. Distributed Memory Parallel Computers offer an interesting performance/cost ratio but need to distribute computations and data. This paper is a study of the implementation of the ray-tracing algorithm on a Distributed Memory Parallel Computer. An original solution, based on the association of a data parallelism approach with a task parallelism one, is presented. A dynamic load redistribution mechanism allows us to ensure a good load balance during the synthesis phase. At the end of the paper, some results of our transputer implementation are presented.","doi":"10.1109/PRS.1993.586090","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE Parallel Rendering Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE Parallel Rendering Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/4492/12738/00586090.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRS.1993.586090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12738","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient parallel ray tracing scheme for distributed memory parallel computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=586090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient parallel ray tracing scheme for distributed memory parallel computers","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/586090/","conferenceDate":"25-26 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4928300","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient parallel ray tracing scheme for distributed memory parallel computers","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00586090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06444S","chronDate":"25-26 Oct 1993","isNumber":"12738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492","citationCount":"1","articleId":"586090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":586133,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A critical issue for such multicast applications and the higher layer protocols required to support them is the manner in which packet losses occur within the multicast network. We present and analyze packet loss data collected on multicast-capable hosts at 17 geographically distinct locations in Europe and the US and connected via the MBone. We experimentally and quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal correlation in packet loss among participants in a multicast session. Our results show that there is some spatial correlation in loss among the multicast sites. However, the shared loss in the backbone of the MBone is, for the most part, low. We find a fairly significant amount of of burst loss (consecutive losses) at most sites. In every dataset, at least one receiver experienced a long loss burst greater than 8 seconds (100 consecutive packets). A predominance of solitary loss was observed in all cases, but periodic losses of length approximately 0.6 seconds and at 30 second intervals were seen by some receivers.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.586133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12739","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12739/00586133.pdf","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet loss correlation in the MBone multicast network","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.586133","startPage":"94","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=586133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Packet loss correlation in the MBone multicast network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/586133/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5690506","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"MiniConfInternet","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet loss correlation in the MBone multicast network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00586133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050865S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"155","articleId":"586133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":586152,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, conventional approaches with linear codes induce stringent device requirements which stem from the bandwidth inefficiency, also denoted as the time penalty, of CDMA. In order to have the advantages of CDMA without its concommitant time penalty, we have been concentrating on multi-attribute CDMA. A previous paper reported on the analysis, design, and analog performance of bandwidth efficient matrix configurations. The research with analog transceivers validated the theory of constructing and implementing matrix codes. In the paper we go a step further and demonstrate the concurrent transmission of digital signals in a fully populated 4/spl times/4 optical matrix (CDMA) system by measuring its raw (no thresholding or processing) bit error rate.

A high-speed link allows data to be sent from instruments to the surface in real-time, and a slower downlink is available to send commands to the remote units. The objective is to develop a cost-efficient, reliable link which will allow real-time data from anywhere in the water column to be transmitted to the surface and then forwarded via satellite link to a user anywhere on the globe. The system operates at 15-20 Khz and uses multiple frequencyshift keying (MFSK) modulation. Bit rates are adjustable, but 1200 bits per second has been selected for this application. The tones which make up the MFSK signal are decoded at the receiver with a Fourier transform implemented on a sophisticated signal processor. The processor can also be programmed to include an error-correction decoder, adaptive equalizer and data packet synchronizer. A simple, low baud rate, command link enables the use of an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) strategy which further increases the reliability of the up-link. A prototype system has been successfully tested at 1200 bits per second over a 3000 meter vertical path. Additional development work on the receiver, command link, and the transmitter is ongoing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings OCEANS","pdfPath":"/iel2/4490/12735/00586702.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"892","publicationTitle":"Proceedings OCEANS","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1989.586702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1989.586702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=586702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An acoustic telemetry system for deep ocean mooring data acquisition and control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telemetry","Oceans","Data acquisition","Control systems","Instruments","Communication system control","Sea surface","Decoding","Transmitters","Satellites"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/586702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 1989","displayDocTitle":"An acoustic telemetry system for deep ocean mooring data acquisition and control","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An acoustic telemetry system for deep ocean mooring data acquisition and control","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00586702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04983S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 1989","isNumber":"12735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4490","citationCount":"17","articleId":"586702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":586703,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We also examine the capacity region of nonorthogonal code-division without successive decoding, and of orthogonal code-division when multipath corrupts the code orthogonality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/586775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5703734","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of broadcast fading channels with variable rate and power","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of broadcast fading channels with variable rate and power","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00586775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02868S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"4","articleId":"586775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":586777,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It can also be viewed as a modification of the pure stripping scheme to one that is suited for a multi-access channel with bursty users. In this scheme, each user is split into M sub-users and the decoder consists of M stripping stages using only single-user decoders. All transmitters of all users are identical, making it suitable for bursty user environments where the set of active users is not known in advance. No synchronization between users at the phase, symbol, or frame level is needed. Although the scheme is only optimal asymptotically in M, it is close to optimal for small M, depending on the bandwidth efficiency.

The near-far robustness is obtained by estimating the a priori unknown propagation delay using a subspace-based technique. Quantities obtained in the estimation procedure are subsequently used to design an interference suppression filter according to the minimum mean-squared error criterion. A simple two-state Viterbi algorithm is used for the data demodulation in the uncoded case.

The optimal receiver structure for one signal of interest plus spatially and temporally correlated noise is MLSE equalization with an appropriately weighted metric for vector signals. We show however that we can alternatively pass the vector received signal through both a MISO (multi-input single output) matched filter and a MIMO blocking equalizer. The blocking equalizer output is independent of the signal of interest and is used as the input to a MISO Wiener filter that reduces the noise in the matched filter output. The resulting structure is called the interference cancelling matched filter (ICMF). The training sequence of the signal of interest can be used to estimate the corresponding channel, from which matched filter and blocking equalizer can be determined. The remaining quantities can be adapted from the available signals. The performance of the ICMF is analyzed in a number of scenarios. The extension to the case of noncircular noise and interference is developed and is shown to be particularly of interest, in the case of 1D constellations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/586812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5703757","displayDocTitle":"An interference cancelling multichannel matched filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interference cancelling multichannel matched filter","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00586812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035729S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"5","articleId":"586812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":586813,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Therefore, one may consider the smart pixel receiver to represent a new class of device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/586899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-3 Nov 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5085514","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"1 Gb/s operation and bit error rate studies of diode-clamped FET-SEED smart pixel receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1 Gb/s operation and bit error rate studies of diode-clamped FET-SEED smart pixel receivers","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00586899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038984S","chronDate":"31 Oct-3 Nov 1994","isNumber":"12750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4484","articleId":"586899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":587016,"authors":[{"name":"C.-K.

The strain induced heavy and light hole band splitting allowed us to choose experimental conditions where only a single transition contributed to the gain. This avoids the ambiguity of multiple spectral holes and simplifies the interpretation of the experimental data. Under high bias, a blue shift was observed.

The symbiotic relationship between wireless communications and digital microelectronics is also developing rapidly. Indeed, mobile and personal communications is now at parity with the computer industry as a major driver in the development of high-speed, low-power integrated circuits. Underlying this is the deep relationship between the theories of signal processing and communication. This is the motivation behind the second objective of this article: to present the concepts and capabilities of spread spectrum so that engineers versed in DSP can quickly grasp its utility and exploit opportunities for further advancing the performance of spread-spectrum systems. To these ends, we first present a simple digital communication system that operates in discrete time. Then we build upon this model to show the basic concepts and resulting benefits of spread spectrum. Then we introduce the two basic spread-spectrum techniques of direct-sequence (DS) and frequency hopping (FH), followed by two methods that have been recently proposed. Next we present simple models for the multipath fading channel, and introduce solutions employing both DS and FH techniques. We then briefly discuss descriptive links to other nonspread modulation techniques and conclude with a brief introduction to the literature for further investigation by the reader.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/12749/00587050.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/79.587050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.587050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=587050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread-spectrum techniques for wireless communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Wireless communication","Symbiosis","Microelectronics","Mobile computing","Computer industry","Driver circuits","High speed integrated circuits","Signal processing","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal communication networks","cellular radio","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","frequency hop communication","fading","multipath channels","multi-access systems","diversity reception","land mobile radio","digital radio","signal processing","discrete time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum techniques","wireless communication","digital microelectronics","personal communications","mobile communications","low power integrated circuits","high speed integrated circuits","signal processing","DSP","spread spectrum systems","digital communication system","discrete time system","direct-sequence spread spectrum","frequency hopping","multipath fading channel","nonspread modulation techniques","cellular radio","PCS","diversity systems","multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"Spread-spectrum techniques for wireless communication","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5620324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread-spectrum techniques for wireless communication","sourcePdf":"00587050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044674S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"91","articleId":"587050","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":587051,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

The increased sharing of spectrum translates into a higher likelihood of users interfering with one another. Interference rejection techniques allow a high capacity of users within the available spectrum. This overview comprises a literature review of published papers pertaining to single-channel adaptive interference rejection in digital wireless dating primarily from 1980 to the present. Though previous overviews are referenced and summarized, the focus is on advances not covered by previous overviews (consequently, some papers are included that predate 1980 because they are not covered in previous overviews). An organizational chart (divided into spread spectrum and nonspread spectrum techniques) is shown which outlines the types of techniques covered. Interference rejection is important for several reasons. Cellular capacity is inherently interference limited, particularly by co-channel interference (CCI) and adjacent-channel interference (ACI). One solution to combat CCI and ACI is to split cells and decrease the power, but cell-splitting is expensive. Interference-rejection techniques often represent a less expensive alternative to cell-splitting. In addition, as newer communication technologies supersede older technologies, interference-rejection techniques are important in helping to facilitate compatibility during transitions between the old and new technologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference rejection in digital wireless communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/79.587051","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/12749/00587051.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.587051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=587051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Interference rejection in digital wireless communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5627542","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference rejection in digital wireless communications","sourcePdf":"00587051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105532S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"131","articleId":"587051","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":587164,"authors":[{"name":"Aiguo Xie","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Aiguo Xie","id":"37087299155"},{"name":"P.A.

The FIFO uses a pulse-like protocol to advance data along the pipeline. Use of this protocol requires careful management of circuit delays within its control circuits, as well as in the coordination of control signals with movement of bundled data. In simulations using hSpice, the throughput of the asynchronous circuit matches that of a two-phase clocked design. We fabricated 50 parts through MOSIS using their 0.6 micron design rules. We estimate from test measurements that the internal FIFO stages could support a maximum throughput from 930 million data items per second for the slowest of the 50 chips to 1126 million per second for the fastest chip. All 50 samples operated correctly as 3.3 V nominal Vdd varied from 1.67 V to over 4.8 V, with corresponding changes in operating speed and power as the supply voltage changed.","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.1997.587181","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4500/12759/00587181.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.1997.587181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FIFO ring performance experiment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=587181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587181/","displayDocTitle":"A FIFO ring performance experiment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5572998","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A FIFO ring performance experiment","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00587181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051706S","chronDate":"7-10 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4500","citationCount":"26","articleId":"587181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":587213,"authors":[{"name":"C.L. da Silva Souza Sobrino","affiliation":["Federal University of Para"],"firstName":"C.L.","lastName":"da Silva Souza Sobrino","id":"37087000132"},{"name":"A.J.

In this setting, the traditional minimum mean-square measure is compared with information theoretic measures, Kalman filtering theory is reexamined, and some new interpretations are offered. We show that for a linear Gaussian system, the Kalman filter is the optimal filter not only for the mean-square error measure, but for several information theoretic measures which are introduced in this work. For nonlinear systems, these same measures generally are in conflict with each other, and the feedback control policy has a dual role with regard to regulation and estimation. For linear stochastic systems with general noise processes, a lower bound on the achievable mutual information between the estimation error and the observation are derived. The properties of an optimal (probing) control law and the associated optimal filter, which achieve this lower bound, and their relationships are investigated. It is shown that for a linear stochastic system with an affine linear filter for the homogeneous system, under some reachability and observability conditions, zero mutual information between estimation error and observations can be achieved only when the system is Gaussian.","doi":"10.1109/9.587329","startPage":"771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/12789/00587329.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.587329","endPage":"785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal state estimation for stochastic systems: an information theoretic approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimal state estimation for stochastic systems: an information theoretic approach","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5625532","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal state estimation for stochastic systems: an information theoretic approach","sourcePdf":"00587329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071921S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"47","articleId":"587329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":587335,"authors":[{"name":"A.

From an original idea by Yakubovich (1967), the approach has been developed under a combination of influences from the Western and Russian traditions of control theory. It is shown how a complex system can be described, using integral quadratic constraints (IQC) for its elementary components. A stability theorem for systems described by IQCs is presented that covers classical passivity/dissipativity arguments but simplifies the use of multipliers and the treatment of causality. A systematic computational approach is described, and relations to other methods of stability analysis are discussed. Last, but not least, the paper contains a summarizing list of IQCs for important types of system components.","doi":"10.1109/9.587335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/12789/00587335.pdf","startPage":"819","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.587335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System analysis via integral quadratic constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"System analysis via integral quadratic constraints","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5625535","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System analysis via integral quadratic constraints","sourcePdf":"00587335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029049S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"937","articleId":"587335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":587336,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The use of neural networks gives a correction of biases generated by the unknown properties of the environment and the algorithmic simplifications. We expect this model to overcome some of the limitations inherent in both empirical and theoretical models: respectively, the inability to adapt to non-classical situations, and exponential computation times.

Estimation of the number of multipath components in a time series of impulse response estimates is accomplished using the singular-value perturbation theory. This involves determining a noise threshold, then selecting eigenvalues from the channel data matrix derived from the measurements. Once the number of multipath components is determined, their corresponding amplitudes, phases and delays are estimated by reducing the problem to the classical estimation of complex sinusoids in the presence of additive noise. Results are shown for the analysis of measured data recorded using a 200 MHz bandwidth measurement system to measure indoor 40 GHz time series data.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12726/00587627.pdf","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1181 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.587627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.587627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=587627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath component estimation for indoor radio channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indoor radio communication","Delay estimation","Time measurement","Amplitude estimation","Phase estimation","Statistical analysis","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Noise measurement","Additive noise","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","multipath channels","statistical analysis","time series","transient response","transient analysis","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","singular value decomposition","phase estimation","amplitude estimation","delays","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath component estimation","indoor radio channels","statistical analysis","time-series measurements","impulse response estimates","singular value perturbation theory","noise threshold","eigenvalues","channel data matrix","amplitude estimation","phase estimation","delay estimation","complex sinusoid estimation","additive noise","measured data","bandwidth","measurement system","200 MHz","40 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Multipath component estimation for indoor radio channels","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690526","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath component estimation for indoor radio channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00587627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045705S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"5","articleId":"587627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":587631,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This channel model assumes that each multipath component of the propagating signal undergoes only one bounce traveling from the transmitter to the receiver and that scattering objects are located uniformly within a circle around the mobile. This geometrically based single bounce macrocell (GBSBM) channel model provides three important parameters that characterize a channel: the power of the multipath components, the time-of-arrival (TOA) of the components, and the angle-of-arrival (AOA) of the components. Doppler spectra and fading envelopes obtained using the GBSBM model is compared with Clarke's (1968) model. The results show that the rate of fading at the base station is lower than at the mobile and the reduction in the Doppler spread at the station is dependent on the direction of motion of the mobile with respect to the base station and the radius of the scattering circle.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometrically based statistical channel model for macrocellular mobile environments","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.587631","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of GLOBECOM'96. 1996 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4477/12726/00587631.pdf","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1201 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1996.587631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=587631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Geometrically based statistical channel model for macrocellular mobile environments","conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690530","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometrically based statistical channel model for macrocellular mobile environments","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00587631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041424S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"61","articleId":"587631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":587651,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In code-hopping S-CDMA, mobile users swap their spreading codes according to a predetermined hopping pattern. In this way, mobile channels which are identified by the spreading codes are exchanged. Performance of code-hopping on the uplink path of S-CDMA systems is evaluated numerically on a typical S-CDMA system in the case of random hopping and compared to that of conventional S-CDMA.

This allows one to decrease the oversampling ratio down to the theoretical bound, thereby restraining computational requirements, while reducing dramatically the traditional analog circuitry. Concretely, such a multirate demodulator should ultimately appear as a low-cost A/D converter operating at a unique sampling frequency, followed by an ASIC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5690554","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for full digital modems implementing asynchronous sampling techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for full digital modems implementing asynchronous sampling techniques","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00587660.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033884S","chronDate":"18-28 Nov. 1996","isNumber":"12726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4477","citationCount":"4","articleId":"587660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":587662,"authors":[{"name":"Jinbiao Xu","affiliation":["Doctoral Class","Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"lastName":"Jinbiao Xu","id":"37857176100"},{"name":"Yumin Wang","lastName":"Yumin Wang","id":"37086999600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3336-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"587662","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Cost function","Blind equalizers","Frequency","Switches","White noise","Finite impulse response filter","Delay","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","equalisers","telecommunication channels","decision theory","convergence of numerical methods","pulse amplitude modulation","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision-directed equalization algorithm","QAM communication systems","cost function","QAM channels equalization","variable step-size algorithm","adaption step-size","equalized signal","constellation plane","carrier phase recovery","blind equalization","convergence speed","ISI","simulation results","PAM"]}],"abstract":"A new decision-directed (NDD) algorithm based on a new cost function is proposed for equalization of QAM channels.

Angular smoothing is not typically done, due to the introduction of a non-uniform resolution loss; axial filtering is also not usually performed on data acquired in 2D mode. The goal of this paper was to assess the effects of angular and axial smoothing on noise and resolution. Angular and axial smoothing was incorporated into the reconstruction process on the Scanditronix PC2048-15B brain PET scanner. In-plane spatial resolution and noise reduction were measured for different amounts of radial and angular smoothing. For radial positions away from the center of the scanner, noise reduction and degraded tangential resolution with no loss of radial resolution were seen. Near the center, no resolution loss was observed, but there was also no reduction in noise for angular filters up to a 7/spl deg/ FWHM. These results can be understood by considering the combined effects of smoothing projections across rows (angles) and then summing (back-projecting). Thus, angular smoothing is not optimal due to its anisotropic noise reduction and resolution degradation properties. However, uniform noise reduction comparable to that seen with radial filtering can be achieved with axial smoothing of transmission data. The axial results suggest that combined radial and axial transmission smoothing could lead to improved noise characteristics with more isotropic resolution degradation.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.587922","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

Here, the authors develop a model in which the following factors are explicitly included: depth dependent geometric sensitivity, photon pair non-colinearity, attenuation, intrinsic detector sensitivity, non-uniform sinogram sampling, crystal penetration and inter-crystal scatter. Statistical reconstruction methods can include these modeling factors in the system matrix that represents the probability of detecting an emission from each image pixel at each detector-pair. The authors describe a method for computing these factors using a combination of calibration measurements, geometric modeling and Monte Carlo computation. By assuming that blurring effects and depth dependent sensitivities are separable, the authors are able to exploit rotational symmetries with respect to the sinogram. This results in substantial savings in both storage requirements and computational costs. Using phantom data the authors show that this system model can produce higher resolution near the center of the field of view, at a given SNR, than both simpler geometric models and reconstructions using filtered backprojection. The authors also show, using an off-centered phantom, that larger improvements in resolution occur towards the edge of the field of view due to the explicit modeling of crystal penetration effects.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1996.587924","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

One can improve the convergence rate of the conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm by incorporating preconditioning operators that approximate the inverse of the Hessian of the objective function. If the 3D cylindrical PET geometry were not truncated at the ends, then the Hessian of the penalized least-squares objective function would be approximately shift-invariant, i.e. G'G would be nearly block-circulant, where G is the system matrix. The authors propose a Fourier preconditioner based on this shift-invariant approximation to the Hessian. Results show that this preconditioner significantly accelerates the convergence of the CG algorithm with only a small increase in computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-9 Nov 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587930/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5671940","conferenceDate":"2-9 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Fully 3D PET image reconstruction using a Fourier preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully 3D PET image reconstruction using a Fourier preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00587930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050293S","chronDate":"2-9 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4502","citationCount":"2","articleId":"587930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":587971,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Many techniques, such as mixture analysis, have been suggested for extracting such images from dynamic sequences of reconstructed PET scans. Methods for assessing the variability in these functional images are of scientific interest. The nonlinearity of the methods used in the mixture analysis approach makes analytic formulae for estimating variability intractable. The usual resampling approach is infeasible because of the prohibitive computational effort in simulating a number of sinogram datasets, applying image reconstruction, and generating parametric images for each replication. Here we introduce an approach that approximates the distribution of the reconstructed PET images by a Gaussian random field and generates synthetic realizations in the imaging domain. This eliminates the reconstruction steps in generating each simulated functional image and is therefore practical. Results of experiments done to evaluate the approach on a model one-dimensional problem are very encouraging. Post-processing of the estimated variances is seen to improve the accuracy of the estimation method. Mixture analysis is used to estimate functional images; however, the suggested approach is general enough to extend to other parametric imaging methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-9 Nov 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-9 Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5684074","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimating variability in functional images using a synthetic resampling approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating variability in functional images using a synthetic resampling approach","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00587994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066905S","chronDate":"2-9 Nov 1996","isNumber":"12951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4502","articleId":"587994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":587996,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, manual fingerprint verification is incapable of meeting today's increasing performance requirements. An automatic fingerprint identification system (AFIS) is needed. This paper describes the design and implementation of an online fingerprint verification system which operates in two stages: minutia extraction and minutia matching. An improved version of the minutia extraction algorithm proposed by Ratha et al. (1995), which is much faster and more reliable, is implemented for extracting features from an input fingerprint image captured with an online inkless scanner. For minutia matching, an alignment-based elastic matching algorithm has been developed. This algorithm is capable of finding the correspondences between minutiae in the input image and the stored template without resorting to exhaustive search and has the ability of adaptively compensating for the nonlinear deformations and inexact pose transformations between fingerprints. The system has been tested on two sets of fingerprint images captured with inkless scanners. The verification accuracy is found to be acceptable. Typically, a complete fingerprint verification procedure takes, on an average, about eight seconds on a SPARC 20 workstation. These experimental results show that our system meets the response time requirements of online verification with high accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/34.587996","startPage":"302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/12846/00587996.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.587996","endPage":"314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line fingerprint verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/587996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"On-line fingerprint verification","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5606017","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line fingerprint verification","sourcePdf":"00587996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03382S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"902","articleId":"587996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":588005,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/12846/00588021.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.588021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.588021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=588021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inducing features of random fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Greedy algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Natural language processing","Character generation","Computer vision","Decision trees","Application software","Iterative methods","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","random processes","learning systems","minimisation","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature induction","random field construction","training samples","subgraphs","Kullback-Leibler divergence","greedy algorithm","iterative scaling algorithm","computer vision","nonMarkovian random fields","learning approach","automatic word classification","natural language processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Inducing features of random fields","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5606023","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inducing features of random fields","sourcePdf":"00588021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086293S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"424","articleId":"588021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":588027,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Theoretical calculation using an effective-index transfer matrix method shows that the allowed range of coupling coefficient increases approximately by 20% in the proposed sampled grating distributed-feedback lasers (DFB) lasers compared with conventional ones. Thus, the tolerance to the coupling coefficient variation improves to the level typically achieved in grating fabrication. The improvement is attributed to the flattened axial photon distribution of gap modes, and therefore stability in other lasing characteristics can be expected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5575653","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sampled grating conventional DFB lasers with fabricability and high immunity to the spatial-hole burning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled grating conventional DFB lasers with fabricability and high immunity to the spatial-hole burning","sourcePdf":"00588095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031274S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"1","articleId":"588095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":588096,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Receivers are subject to nonnegligible noise, and the DCPC attempts to bring each receiver's CIR (carrier-to-interference ratio) above a given quality target. Two classes of distributed admission control are considered. One is a noninteractive admission control (N-IAC), where an admission decision is instantaneously made based on the system state. The other is an interactive admission control (IAC), under which the new mobile is permitted to interact with one or more potential channels before a decision is made. The algorithms are evaluated with respect to their execution time and their decision errors. Two types of errors are examined: type I error, where a new mobile is erroneously accepted and results in outage; and type II error, where a new mobile is erroneously rejected and results in blocking. The algorithms in the N-IAC class accept a new mobile if and only if the uplink and the downlink interferences are below certain corresponding thresholds. These algorithms are subject to errors of type I and type II. In the IAC class, we derive a soft and safe (SAS) admission algorithm, which is type I and type II error free, and protects the CIR's of all active links at any moment of time. A fast-SAS version, which is only type I error-free, is proposed for practical implementation, and is evaluated in several case studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1997","accessionNumber":"5613540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Soft and safe admission control in cellular networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft and safe admission control in cellular networks","sourcePdf":"00588096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03346S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"12858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"77","articleId":"588096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":588105,"authors":[{"name":"Renyuan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Renyuan Huang","id":"37087518068"},{"name":"Cheng-Ping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Cheng-Ping Wang","id":"37087280597"},{"name":"C.

The feedforward significantly reduces the output swing of the integrator and thus improve the stability and accuracy of the circuit. As a result, high accuracy is obtained with only first-order integration and a low oversampling ratio, and the useful bandwidth is enlarged.

This structure accomplishes a highly efficient transformation between force and displacement overcoming the main mechanical drawback of shape memory alloys, that being limited strain. Time domain open loop experiments were then conducted to determine the intrinsic properties of the actuator. From these experiments and from the knowledge of the underlying physics of SMAs, a multiterm model, including linear and nonlinear elements, was proposed. After further investigation and simulation, it was found that most of these complexities did not need to be considered in order to explain the reported results, and that the model could be reduced to that of a single integrator. A variable structure controller was then applied to a pair of antagonist actuators. The feedback switches between the two actuators according to the sign of the displacement error. A further improvement was added to compensate for known gross nonlinearities by modulating the current magnitude in a discrete manner as a function of the state space position. It was therefore possible to realize smooth and robust control with very little cost in complexity.","doi":"10.1109/37.588180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.588180","startPage":"80","endPage":"88","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/12909/00588180.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable structure control of shape memory alloy actuators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","displayDocTitle":"Variable structure control of shape memory alloy actuators","publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5610122","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588180/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable structure control of shape memory alloy actuators","sourcePdf":"00588180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025756S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"116","articleId":"588180","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":588184,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

We present a framework for sensor-based robot motion planning that uses learning to handle arbitrarily configured sensors and robots. The theoretical basis of this approach is the concept of the perceptual control manifold that extends the notion of the robot configuration space to include sensor space. To overcome modeling uncertainty, the topology-representing-network algorithm is employed to learn a representation of the perceptual control manifold. By exploiting the topology-preserving features of the neural network, a diffusion-based path planning strategy leads to flexible obstacle avoidance. The practical feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on a pneumatically driven robot arm (SoftArm) using visual sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5610123","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Motion planning of a pneumatic robot using a neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion planning of a pneumatic robot using a neural network","sourcePdf":"00588194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043271S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"17","articleId":"588194","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":588207,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The implication of these requirements with regard to allowable metallic contamination levels is investigated with a one-dimensional model based on Shockley-Read-Hall generation-recombination. The model was developed to predict leakage-current in carrier-depleted regions as a function of basic process and metallic contaminant parameters. As device dimensions are reduced, transition metal homogeneous contamination in process chemicals can be an important source of generation-recombination centers that result in the dominant generation-current in the space-charge region. The model allows an estimation of an upper bound for transition metal contamination in advanced processes and is applied for DRAM leakage predictions. Using the model, it is demonstrated that the trend toward lower leakage-current density requirements reverses after the 64-Mbit generation DRAM as a result of memory-cell architecture trends which significantly reduce the space-charge volume.","doi":"10.1109/ASMC.1994.588261","startPage":"241","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference and Workshop (ASMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference and Workshop (ASMC)","pdfPath":"/iel4/4557/12884/00588261.pdf","endPage":"250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.1994.588261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588261/","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the effect of contamination-induced leakage current in view of DRAM architectural trends","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5111856","publicationDate":"1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the effect of contamination-induced leakage current in view of DRAM architectural trends","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00588261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078477S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"12884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4557","citationCount":"1","articleId":"588261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":588273,"authors":[{"name":"D.

After envelope detection, radar range samples are stored in a tapped delay line such that a test cell is surrounded on either side by a set of reference cells. The VI-CFAR dynamically chooses either the leading reference cells, the lagging reference cells, or the combined leading and lagging reference cells for background noise/clutter power estimation. Selection of the reference cells and the background estimation algorithm is based on the ratio of the means of the two half reference windows and on the \"variability index (VI)\" values calculated for the leading and lagging reference windows. The VI is a second-order statistic that is related to the shape parameter. Hypothesis tests based on the variability indices and the mean ratio are used to decide if the environment is homogeneous, contains multiple targets, or contains an extended clutter edge. Based on the decision, the VI-CFAR tailors the background estimation algorithm as discussed. The VI-CFAR processor provides low loss constant false alarm rate performance in a homogeneous environment and also performs robustly in non-homogeneous environments including multiple targets and extended clutter edges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 1997","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5716383","displayDocTitle":"VI-CFAR: a novel CFAR algorithm based on data variability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VI-CFAR: a novel CFAR algorithm based on data variability","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00588317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036506S","chronDate":"13-15 May 1997","isNumber":"12907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4575","citationCount":"15","articleId":"588317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":588328,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The adaptive signal detection problem has been addressed extensively for the case of additive Gaussian noise. However, the corresponding problem for the non-Gaussian case has received limited attention. The additive non-Gaussian noise is assumed to be modeled by a spherically invariant random process (SIRP). The innovations based detection algorithm for the case of constant signal with unknown complex amplitude is derived. The resulting receiver structure is shown to be equivalent to an adaptive matched filter compared to a data dependent threshold. Performance analysis of the derived receiver for the case of a K-distributed SIRV is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE National Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4575/12907/00588334.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE National Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1997.588334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1997.588334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12907","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=588334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parametric multichannel detection algorithm for correlated non-Gaussian random processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Additive noise","Signal detection","Parametric statistics","Adaptive signal detection","Gaussian noise","Random processes","Technological innovation","Matched filters","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","parameter estimation","telecommunication channels","random processes","white noise","radar detection","adaptive signal detection","radar receivers","adaptive filters","matched filters","filtering theory","linear antenna arrays","antenna phased arrays","phased array radar","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlated nonGaussian random processes","parametric multichannel detection algorithm","adaptive multichannel signal detection","additive correlated nonGaussian noise","parametric model based approach","additive Gaussian noise","additive nonGaussian noise","spherically invariant random process","SIRP","innovations based detection algorithm","constant signal","complex amplitude","receiver structure","adaptive matched filter","data dependent threshold","performance analysis","K-distributed SIRV","linear phased array radar","white noise","interference covariance matrix","radar clutter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"A parametric multichannel detection algorithm for correlated non-Gaussian random processes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5716399","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parametric multichannel detection algorithm for correlated non-Gaussian random processes","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00588334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033348S","chronDate":"13-15 May 1997","isNumber":"12907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4575","citationCount":"57","articleId":"588334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":588475,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The other systems reuses all channels in all cells 1/1, but does not reuse channels within a cell. Thus, the maximum number of users in the two systems are equal. In order to account for the increased interference, the 1/3 system directs the antenna pattern nulls against the same cell co-channel users while the 1/1 system directs nulls against the co-channel users in other cells. The performance of the two systems are compared as a function of the azimuth angular width (seen from the base) of the multipaths generated at the mobile.

The effectiveness of the adaptive interference suppression is assured by the increased data rate and low spreading ratio afforded by the time division multiplexing of user signals. As a basis for comparison, a model for the reverse channel of the IS-95 cellular CDMA standard has been developed.

In these systems, a correlator or matched filter is used within the receiver to despread the encoded waveform before the underlying digital data is recovered. The matched filter may be implemented either before or after the received waveform has undergone analog-to-digital conversion. Since power consumption is a principal concern for portable PCS terminals, it is proper to consider which matched filter implementation-analog or digital-leads to a more power efficient spread-spectrum receiver. These two different implementations are examined, and a methodology is provided for choosing the appropriate circuit-implementing technology using power consumption as the primary metric of comparison, It is shown that neither the analog nor the digital matched filter implementation is universally appropriate. Rather, a surface is mapped out in the multi-dimensional design space where, on one side of this surface, a digital solution is preferable, while on the other side of the surface, an analog circuit is appropriate.

The performance of a satellite mobile system employing direct sequence (DS) CDMA is presented. One cannot expect CDMA performance on satellite links comparable to what one can achieve using CDMA on terrestrial links. It is shown that because of the length of the round trip propagation delay on a satellite channel, closed-loop power control is not effective. Because most of the proposed systems operate in a frequency division duplex (FDD) mode, open loop power control cannot track out variations due to multipath fading (although it can track variations in received power due to both distance/shadowing attenuation). The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the coherence bandwidth of many satellite links is on the order of 10 MHz. This implies that in order for a DS system to allow performance enhancement by virtue of RAKE reception, the spread bandwidth must exceed 10 MHz. Any signal using a smaller spread bandwidth will experience flat fading. This combination of flat fading and the lack of effectiveness of closed-loop power control causes a satellite-based CDMA system to perform significantly worse than a terrestrial one. The results emphasize the effects of power control error on the performance of the system.

System capacity is examined from the perspectives of both average probability of error and outage probability.

One such subset is the implicit style state machine (multiple uses of edge triggered events within an always block). With this style, one can obtain working silicon in less time because the implicit style is more like software design. Unfortunately, most synthesis vendors do not support the implicit style. To make the implicit style more accessible, a freely available synthesis preprocessor is described that converts implicit style always blocks into other equivalent Verilog, which can then be synthesized by most commercial synthesis tools. This paper discusses advantages of the implicit style, how the preprocessor translates implicit style code into a one-hot design, and why the language subset (non-blocking assignment) was chosen so that the semantics of the synthesized Verliog can agree with the simulation semantics defined by IEEE 1364.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Mar-3 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588530/","accessionNumber":"5572462","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A synthesis preprocessor that converts implicit style Verilog into one-hot designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A synthesis preprocessor that converts implicit style Verilog into one-hot designs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00588530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039541S","chronDate":"31 Mar-3 Apr 1997","isNumber":"12714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4480","citationCount":"7","articleId":"588530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":588554,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The MMC differs from a traditional microchannel heat sink in that the how length is greatly reduced to a small fraction of the total length of the heat sink. Alternating inlet and outlet channels guide the coolant to and from the microchannels. A silicon heat sink cooled by fluorocarbon liquid was studied. The repetitive nature of the manifold and microchannels results in many planes of symmetry. The thermal and fluid characteristics of a MMC assembly can modeled by a \"unit cell\" bounded by the centerlines of the manifold inlet and outlet channels and by those of the microchannels and heat sink walls. Three dimensional (3-D) finite element models of single manifold microchannels were constructed and used to simulate fluid flow and heat transfer. Conjugate analysis suggested that an isothermal model would produce suitably accurate results. In addition to coolant flow rate, channel length, width, and depth were varied. Regions of high heat transfer were found near the inlet. At higher inlet velocities, secondary maxima in heat transfer were seen at the base of the microchannel below the inlet, and at the top of the microchannel near the exit. The flow was found to accelerate to a greater extent than predicted by rectangular duct analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588554/","volume":"20","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5616616","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Manifold microchannel heat sinks: isothermal analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manifold microchannel heat sinks: isothermal analysis","sourcePdf":"00588554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033167S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"62","articleId":"588554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":588571,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This hybrid approach of integration offers a unique possibility of exploiting inherent complementary advantages of planar structures and NRD waveguides for low-cost wireless applications while eliminating the potential drawbacks associated with both dissimilar structures. Compared to the existing NRD-guide related technology, the proposed framework consists of relocated planar structures on the top and/or the bottom plates of an NRD-guide, sharing the common ground planes. Such a hybrid scheme is particularly suitable for millimeter-wave systems in which active devices can be made with the planar-line technique while passive components can be made with the NRD-guide technique. The two subsets of a complete functional system are interconnected through a class of aperture-based transitions which can be designed to have wide-band performance. In addition, the multichip module (MCM) technique is readily achieved under this proposed scheme. Experimental prototypes, including passive-component and active-device, based on the new hybrid technology presented in this paper, show that the novel hybrid technology promises to be useful in the design of future microwave and millimeter-wave circuits and systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/12839/00588607.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.588607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.588607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=588607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid integration technology of planar circuits and NRD-guide for cost-effective microwave and millimeter-wave applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave technology","Microwave circuits","Milling machines","Millimeter wave technology","Integrated circuit technology","Millimeter wave circuits","Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave radar","Microwave integrated circuits","MMICs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonradiative dielectric waveguides","microwave integrated circuits","millimetre wave integrated circuits","integrated circuit technology","multichip modules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid integration technology","planar circuit","nonradiative-dielectric waveguide","microwave circuit","millimeter-wave circuit","low-cost wireless","active device","passive component","aperture-based transition","multichip module"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid integration technology of planar circuits and NRD-guide for cost-effective microwave and millimeter-wave applications","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5618041","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid integration technology of planar circuits and NRD-guide for cost-effective microwave and millimeter-wave applications","sourcePdf":"00588607.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035229S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"64","articleId":"588607","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":588624,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Bin Yao","id":"37286440100"},{"name":"M.

The newly proposed adaptive robust control (ARC) is applied to make the resulting closed-loop system robust to model uncertainties, instead of the disturbance observer (DOB) design previously tested by many researchers. Compared to DOB, the proposed ARC has a better tracking performance and transient in the presence of discontinuous disturbances, such as Coulomb friction, and it is of a lower order. As a result, time-consuming and costly rigorous friction identification and compensation is alleviated, and overall tracking performance is improved. The ARC design can also handle large parameter variations and is flexible in introducing extra nonlinear robust control terms and parameter adaptations to further improve the transient response and tracking performance. An anti-integration windup mechanism is inherently built in the ARC and, thus, the problem of control saturation is alleviated. Extensive comparative experimental tests are performed, and the results show the improved performance of the proposed ARC.","doi":"10.1109/3516.588624","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3516/12835/00588624.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.588624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance robust motion control of machine tools: an adaptive robust control approach and comparative experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=588624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/588624/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance robust motion control of machine tools: an adaptive robust control approach and comparative experiments","volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5624547","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance robust motion control of machine tools: an adaptive robust control approach and comparative experiments","sourcePdf":"00588624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042812S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"196","articleId":"588624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":588628,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

A distribution mixture is said to be generalized when the exact nature of components is not known, but each of them belongs to a finite known set of families of distributions. Estimating such a mixture entails a supplementary difficulty: one must label, for each class and each sensor, the exact nature of the corresponding distribution. Such generalized mixtures have been studied assuming that the components lie in the Pearson system. We propose a more general procedure with applications to estimating generalized multisensor hidden Markov chains. Our proposed method is applied to the problem of unsupervised image segmentation. The method proposed allows one to: 1) identify the conditional distribution for each class and each sensor, 2) estimate the unknown parameters in this distribution, 3) estimate priors, and 4) estimate the \"true\" class image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5606032","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of generalized multisensor hidden Markov chains and unsupervised image segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of generalized multisensor hidden Markov chains and unsupervised image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00589206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046219S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"92","articleId":"589206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":589207,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We make a comparative study of six well-known pruning methods with the aim of understanding their theoretical foundations, their computational complexity, and the strengths and weaknesses of their formulation. Comments on the characteristics of each method are empirically supported. In particular, a wide experimentation performed on several data sets leads us to opposite conclusions on the predictive accuracy of simplified trees from some drawn in the literature. We attribute this divergence to differences in experimental designs. Finally, we prove and make use of a property of the reduced error pruning method to obtain an objective evaluation of the tendency to overprune/underprune observed in each method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative analysis of methods for pruning decision trees","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.589207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel4/34/12904/00589207.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.589207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=589207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"A comparative analysis of methods for pruning decision trees","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5606033","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative analysis of methods for pruning decision trees","sourcePdf":"00589207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067658S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"294","articleId":"589207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":589215,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We developed a texture feature based thresholding algorithm to address this problem. Our algorithm consists of three steps: 1) candidate thresholds are produced through iterative use of Otsu's algorithm (1978); 2) texture features associated with each candidate threshold are extracted from the run-length histogram of the accordingly binarized image; 3) the optimal threshold is selected so that desirable document texture features are preserved. Experiments with 9,000 machine printed address blocks from an unconstrained US mail stream demonstrated that over 99.6 percent of the images were successfully binarized by the new thresholding method, appreciably better than those obtained by typical existing thresholding techniques. Also, a system run with 500 troublesome mail address blocks showed that an 8.1 percent higher character recognition rate was achieved with our algorithm as compared with Otsu's algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5606042","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Document image binarization based on texture features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Document image binarization based on texture features","sourcePdf":"00589217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04349S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"126","articleId":"589217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":589235,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Victim caching was proposed by Jouppi (1990) as an approach to improve the miss rate of direct-mapped caches without affecting their access time. This approach augments the direct-mapped main cache with a small fully associate cache, called victim cache, that stores cache blocks evicted from the main cache as a result of replacements. We propose and evaluate an improvement of this scheme, called selective victim caching. In this scheme, incoming blocks into the first-level cache are placed selectively in the main cache or a small victim cache by the use of a prediction scheme based on their past history of use. In addition, interchanges of blocks between the main cache and the victim cache are also performed selectively. We show that the scheme results in significant improvements in miss rate as well as the average memory access time, for both small and large caches (4 Kbytes-128 Kbytes). For example, simulations with ten instruction traces from the SPEC '92 benchmark suite showed an average improvement of approximately 21 percent in miss rate over simple victim caching for a 16-Kbyte cache with a block size of 32 bytes; the number of blocks interchanged between the main and victim caches reduced by approximately 70 percent. Implementation alternatives for the scheme in an on-chip processor cache are also described.","doi":"10.1109/12.589235","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"603","endPage":"610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/12905/00589235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.589235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective victim caching: a method to improve the performance of direct-mapped caches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","History","Reduced instruction set computing","Clocks","Random access memory","Cache memory","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-mapped caches","performance","victim caching","miss rate","selective victim caching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Selective victim caching: a method to improve the performance of direct-mapped caches","volume":"46","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5605888","publicationDate":"May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589235/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective victim caching: a method to improve the performance of direct-mapped caches","sourcePdf":"00589235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02605S","chronDate":"May 1997","isNumber":"12905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"22","articleId":"589235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":589238,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The bulk of signaling in D-AMPS-based PCS, as, in most modern telecommunication systems, is based on Signaling System No. 7 (SS7). SS7 is a general-purpose common channel signaling (CCS) system specified by the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and adapted to North American needs by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). Besides the orthodox use for signaling, SS7 is used in D-AMPS-based PCS for operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) of the D-AMPS-based PCS network and for the short message service (SMS). This article reviews the use of SS7 in D-AMPS-based PCS. It motivates the need for a gradual return to orthodoxy where this use is confined to signaling. It also proposes alternatives to the current heterodox use. The alternatives the authors suggest are all rooted in orthodoxy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Personal communication networks","ISDN","Uninterruptible power systems","Message service","Protocols","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Electronics industry","Communication system signaling","Carbon capture and storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","personal communication networks","maintenance engineering","telecommunication services","telecommunication signalling","telecommunication standards","standardisation","ANSI standards","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["D-AMPS-based PCS","SS7","Advanced Mobile Phone System","personal communications services","Signaling System No. 7","common channel signaling system","International Telecommunication Union","Telecommunications Standardization Sector","ITU-T","North America","American National Standard Institute","ANSI","operation","administration","maintenance","provisioning","OAM&P","PCS network","short message service"]}],"doi":"10.1109/98.589263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/12854/00589263.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.589263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of SS7 in D-AMPS-based PCS: orthodoxy vs. heterodoxy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=589263","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Use of SS7 in D-AMPS-based PCS: orthodoxy vs. heterodoxy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589263/","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5631112","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of SS7 in D-AMPS-based PCS: orthodoxy vs. heterodoxy","sourcePdf":"00589263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022742S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"12854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"1","articleId":"589263","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":589363,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.

We have studied the application of backpropagation neural networks to several problems of estimation and identification in nuclear power plants. These problems often have been reported to be very time-consuming in the training phase. Among the different approaches suggested to ease the backpropagation training process, input data pretreatment has been pointed out, although no specific procedure has been proposed. We have found that input data normalization with certain criteria, prior to a training process, is crucial to obtain good results as well as to fasten significantly the calculations. This paper shows how data normalization affects the performance error of parameter estimators trained to predict the value of several variables of a PWR nuclear power plant. The criteria needed to accomplish such data normalization are also described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589532/","volume":"44","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5625674","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Importance of input data normalization for the application of neural networks to complex industrial problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Importance of input data normalization for the application of neural networks to complex industrial problems","sourcePdf":"00589532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026655S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"12840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"280","articleId":"589532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":589533,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper presents a flexible formulation for this purpose. The proposed formulation identifies an important price component for reactive power, which is fundamentally different from those existing in the literature. This makes the pricing of reactive power more understandable. The proposed approach is efficient for real-time application and allows for carrying out active and reactive power pricing simultaneously or independently through the use of the decoupled optimal power flow formulation. Price signals derived from this approach are quite meaningful from an engineering point of view. In addition, the proposed approach can be easily extended to evaluate NUGs and wheeling transactions.

A set of feasible generator commitment schedules is first formulated by genetic-enhanced neural networks. These pre-committed schedules are then optimized by the dynamic programming technique. By the proposed approach, learning stagnation is avoided. The neural network stability and accuracy are significantly increased.

The hydro system is divided into watersheds, which are further broken down into reservoirs. The watersheds are optimized by network flow programming (NFP). Priority-list-based dynamic programming is used to solve the hydro unit commitment (HUC) problem at the reservoir level. A successive approximation method is used for updating the marginal water values (Lagrange multipliers) to improve the hydro unit commitment convergence, due to the large size and multiple couplings of water conservation constraints.

The purpose of the model is to represent the generation characteristics of the hydropower plants accurately. In the modelling part, the paper focuses on two requests stated from power producers in an earlier study. First, it is desirable to operate on points with good efficiency. Second, start-ups and shut-downs of the units should not be carried out too often, since this is related to a cost. The problem is decomposed into a subproblem for each hydropower plant by relaxing the power balance equation and using variable splitting. The advantage of this relaxation is that network programming and dynamic programming methods can be used, which have proved to work well for power system planning issues. The relaxation used in this work has, as far as the authors know, not been applied in the field before. The master problem is solved by a subgradient technique. Finally, a numerical example from a part of the Swedish power system illustrates the technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5581187","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Variable splitting applied to modelling of start-up costs in short term hydro generation scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable splitting applied to modelling of start-up costs in short term hydro generation scheduling","sourcePdf":"00589678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027701S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"60","articleId":"589678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":589693,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The nonlinear SCED problem is linearized, and then solved by a predictor-corrector interior point method. Besides describing the basic algorithm, the paper focuses on several important issues that are critical to its efficient implementation, including the adjustment of barrier parameter, the determination of initial point, and so on. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate their impact on the performance of the algorithm. Some suggestions, such as using the feasibility condition to adjust the way of computing barrier parameter /spl mu/ and customizing initial point by adopting a relative small threshold, are proposed to reduce the overall iterations required by the algorithm. The computational results on power systems of 236 to 2124 buses have shown that these suggestions are very effective, improving the performance of the algorithm by a factor of 2. Comparison with a pure primal-dual interior point method is also provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed predictor-corrector method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/12806/00589693.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.589693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.589693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=589693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient predictor-corrector interior point algorithm for security-constrained economic dispatch","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction algorithms","Economic forecasting","Power generation economics","Linear programming","Power systems","Power system security","Power system economics","Student members","Senior members","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system security","economics","load dispatching","predictor-corrector methods","numerical analysis","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient predictor-corrector interior point algorithm","security-constrained economic dispatch","successive linear programming","barrier parameter adjustment","initial point determination","barrier parameter computation","initial point customisation","iterations reduction","pure primal-dual interior point method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","displayDocTitle":"An efficient predictor-corrector interior point algorithm for security-constrained economic dispatch","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1997","accessionNumber":"5581192","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient predictor-corrector interior point algorithm for security-constrained economic dispatch","sourcePdf":"00589693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07381S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"79","articleId":"589693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":589708,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The idea is to use the information on the prevailing operating condition and directly provide contingency screening and ranking using a trained neural network. To train the two neural networks for the large scale systems of BC Hydro and Hydro Quebec, in total 1691 detailed transient stability simulation were conducted, 1158 for BC Hydro system and 533 for the Hydro Quebec system. The simulation program was equipped with the energy margin calculation module (Second Kick) to measure the energy margin in each run. The first set of results showed poor performance for the neural networks in assessing the dynamic security. However a number of corrective measures improved the results significantly. These corrective measures included: (a) the effectiveness of output, (b) the number of outputs, (c) the type of features (static versus dynamic), (d) the number of features, (e) system partitioning and (f) the ratio of training samples to features. The final results obtained using the large scale systems of BC Hydro and Hydro Quebec demonstrates a good potential for neural network in dynamic security assessment contingency screening and ranking.","doi":"10.1109/59.589789","startPage":"954","endPage":"960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.589789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=12806","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/12806/00589789.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large scale dynamic security screening and ranking using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/589789/","displayDocTitle":"Large scale dynamic security screening and ranking using neural networks","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5581213","publicationDate":"May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large scale dynamic security screening and ranking using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00589789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036151S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"12806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"88","articleId":"589789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":589804,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The selection of optimal network topology is an NP-hard combinatorial problem so that the classical enumeration-based methods grow exponentially with network size. In this study, a heuristic search algorithm inspired by evolutionary methods is presented to solve the all-terminal network design problem when considering cost and reliability.

The efficacy of I-NESA in solving both varieties of problems is demonstrated by comparing its results with those of simulated annealing (SA). I-NESA, using the Glauber algorithm and an exponential cooling schedule, provides a stable global solution to all the problems considered. The essential features of I-NESA, (1) the nonequilibrium concept while coming out of an inner iteration, and (2) incorporation of the simplex-like heuristic, make it very fast and stable in obtaining the global solution when compared to the traditional SA. Fast convergence was observed in all the problems studied.
