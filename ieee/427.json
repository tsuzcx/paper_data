We propose a new mixture-of-fundamental-matrices model to describe the multibody motions from two views. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation, in conjunction with a random sampling scheme, we show that the problem can be naturally formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. Consequently, the motion segmentation problem can be solved efficiently by linear program relaxation. Experiments demonstrate that: without assuming the actual number of motions our method produces accurate segmentation result. This LP formulation has also other advantages, such as easy to handle outliers and easy to enforce prior knowledge etc.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.382975","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.382975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-View Motion Segmentation from Linear Programming Relaxation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270000/","displayDocTitle":"Two-View Motion Segmentation from Linear Programming Relaxation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737844","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270000/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-View Motion Segmentation from Linear Programming Relaxation","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084996S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4270002,"authors":[{"name":"Saad Ali","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Saad","lastName":"Ali","id":"37397556100"},{"name":"Mubarak Shah","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Mubarak","lastName":"Shah","id":"37275509600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270002","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":346,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2676},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lagrangian functions","Stability analysis","Layout","Computer vision","Bridges","Cities and towns","Safety","Tensile stress","Videos","Fluid dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","image motion analysis","image segmentation","integration","object detection","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lagrangian particle dynamics approach","crowd flow segmentation","flow stability analysis","numerical integration scheme","flow map","spatial gradient method","Cauchy Green deformation tensor","finite time Lyapunov exponent"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a framework in which Lagrangian particle dynamics is used for the segmentation of high density crowd flows and detection of flow instabilities. For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a flow map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework. Any change in the number of flow segments over time is regarded as an instability, which is detected by establishing correspondences between flow segments over time. The experiments are conducted on a challenging set of videos taken from Google Video and a National Geographic documentary.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lagrangian Particle Dynamics Approach for Crowd Flow Segmentation and Stability Analysis","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.382977","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270002.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.382977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Lagrangian Particle Dynamics Approach for Crowd Flow Segmentation and Stability Analysis","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270002/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737846","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lagrangian Particle Dynamics Approach for Crowd Flow Segmentation and Stability Analysis","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039539S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"346","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270004,"authors":[{"name":"Marshall F.

Gaussian MRF models are particularly convenient to work with because they can be implemented using matrix and linear algebra routines. However, recent research has focused on on discrete-valued and non-convex MRF models because Gaussian models tend to over-smooth images and blur edges. In this paper, we show how to train a Gaussian conditional random field (GCRF) model that overcomes this weakness and can outperform the non-convex field of experts model on the task of denoising images. A key advantage of the GCRF model is that the parameters of the model can be optimized efficiently on relatively large images. The competitive performance of the GCRF model and the ease of optimizing its parameters make the GCRF model an attractive option for vision and image processing applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Gaussian Conditional Random Fields for Low-Level Vision","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern

This paper describes a novel and effective technique to estimate texture flow in an image given a small example patch. The key idea consists of extracting a dense set of features from the example patch where discrete orientations are encapsulated into the feature vector such that rotation can be simulated as a linear shift of the vector. This dense feature space is then compressed by PCA and clustered using EM to produce a set of small set of principal features. Obtaining these principal features at varying image scales, we can compute the per-pixel scale and orientation likelihoods for the distorted texture. The final texture flow estimation is formulated as the MAP solution of a labeling Markov network which is solved using belief propagation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate good results even for highly distorted examples.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Sampling methods","Vectors","Image sampling","Image analysis","Image texture analysis","Image segmentation","Computational modeling","Image coding","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","estimation theory","feature extraction","image sampling","image texture","Markov processes","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense feature sampling","texture flow estimation","vision related task","image texture","feature extraction","feature vector","principal component analysis","distorted texture","Markov network","belief propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.382990","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270015.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.382990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Estimation of Texture Flow via Dense Feature Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Estimation of Texture Flow via Dense Feature Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270015/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270015/","accessionNumber":"9737859","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Estimation of Texture Flow via Dense Feature Sampling","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077534S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270016,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278877900"},{"name":"Gerard Medioni","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Medioni","id":"37280043300"},{"name":"Isaac Cohen","affiliation":["Automation and Control Solutions, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37274584700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270016","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1001},"abstract":"We propose a framework for general multiple target tracking, where the input is a set of candidate regions in each frame, as obtained from a state of the art background learning, and the goal is to recover trajectories of targets over time from noisy observations. Due to occlusions by targets and static objects, noisy segmentation and false alarms, one foreground region may not correspond to one target faithfully. Therefore the one-to-one assumption used in most data association algorithm is not always satisfied. Our method overcomes the one-to-one assumption by formulating the visual tracking problem in terms of finding the best spatial and temporal association of observations, which maximizes the consistency of both motion and appearance of trajectories. To avoid enumerating all possible solutions, we take a data driven Markov chain Monte Carlo (DD-MCMC) approach to sample the solution space efficiently.

Given a low-resolution image, its underlying higher-resolution details are synthesized based on a set of training images. In order to build a compact yet descriptive training set, we investigate the characteristic local structures contained in large volumes of small image patches. Inspired by progress in manifold learning research, we take the assumption that small image patches in the low-resolution and high-resolution images form manifolds with similar local geometry in the corresponding image feature spaces. This assumption leads to a super-resolution approach which reconstructs the feature vector corresponding to an image patch by its neighbors in the feature space. In addition, the residual errors associated with the reconstructed image patches are also estimated to compensate for the information loss in the local averaging process. Experimental results show that our hallucination method can synthesize higher-quality images compared with other methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383001","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270026.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Hallucination Using Neighbor Embedding over Visual Primitive Manifolds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270026/","displayDocTitle":"Image Hallucination Using Neighbor Embedding over Visual Primitive Manifolds","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737870","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270026/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Hallucination Using Neighbor Embedding over Visual Primitive Manifolds","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051824S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270027,"authors":[{"name":"Lidan Miao","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Lidan","lastName":"Miao","id":"37302326200"},{"name":"Hairong Qi","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Hairong","lastName":"Qi","id":"37273173300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270027","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Image restoration","Source separation","Deconvolution","Degradation","Additive white noise","Kernel","Image segmentation","Independent component analysis","Hafnium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","image restoration","matrix decomposition","optical transfer function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","image restoration","physical image formation","distorted image","point spread function","matrix-vector notation","block-decorrelation constrained nonnegative matrix factorization"]}],"abstract":"This paper re-investigates the physical image formation process leading to a new interpretation of the classic image restoration problem from a blind source separation (BSS) perspective. The observed distorted image is considered as a linear combination of a set of shifted version of the point spread function (PSF) with the weight coefficients determined by the actual image. The new interpretation brings two immediate benefits to the practice of image restoration. First, we can utilize the rich set of BSS methods to solve the blind image restoration problem. Second, the new formulation in terms of matrix product has the equivalent merit as the conventional matrix-vector notation in theoretical study of restoration algorithms. We develop a smoothness and block-decorrelation constrained nonnegative matrix factorization method (termed CNMF) to blindly recover both the PSF and the actual image. The experimental results compared to one of the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the merit of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383002","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270027.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Blind Source Separation Perspective on Image Restoration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270027/","displayDocTitle":"A Blind Source Separation Perspective on Image Restoration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737871","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270027/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Blind Source Separation Perspective on Image Restoration","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051197S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4270031,"authors":[{"name":"Jue Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Jue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37423161100"},{"name":"Michael F.

Matting is inherently an ill-posed problem. Previous matting approaches either use naive color sampling methods to estimate foreground and background colors for unknown pixels, or use propagation-based methods to avoid color sampling under weak assumptions about image statistics. We argue that neither method itself is enough to generate good results for complex natural images. We analyze the weaknesses of previous matting approaches, and propose a new robust matting algorithm. In our approach we also sample foreground and background colors for unknown pixels, but more importantly, analyze the confidence of these samples. Only high confidence samples are chosen to contribute to the matting energy function which is minimized by a Random Walk. The energy function we define also contains a neighborhood term to enforce the smoothness of the matte. To validate the approach, we present an extensive and quantitative comparison between our algorithm and a number of previous approaches in hopes of providing a benchmark for future matting research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270031/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737875","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Color Sampling for Robust Matting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Color Sampling for Robust Matting","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058243S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"245","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":4270039,"authors":[{"name":"Chunming Li","affiliation":["Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Li","id":"37291265000"},{"name":"Chiu-Yen Kao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chiu-Yen","lastName":"Kao","id":"37401593000"},{"name":"John C.

In this paper, we propose a region-based active contour model that is able to utilize image information in local regions. The major contribution of this paper is the introduction of a local binary fitting energy with a kernel function, which enables the extraction of accurate local image information. Therefore, our model can be used to segment images with intensity inhomogeneity, which overcomes the limitation of piecewise constant models. Comparisons with other major region-based models, such as the piece-wise smooth model, show the advantages of our method in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.

The goal is to create a more efficient terrain classification algorithm which can be used in real-time, onboard an autonomous vehicle. Instead of building a monolithic classifier with uniformly complex representation for each class, the main idea here is to actively consider the labels or misclassification cost while constructing the classifier. For example, some terrain classes might be easily separable from the rest, so very simple representation will be sufficient to learn and detect these classes. This is taken advantage of during learning, so the algorithm automatically builds a variable-length visual representation which varies according to the complexity of the classification task. This enables fast recognition of different terrain types during testing. We also show how to select a set of feature representations so that the desired terrain classification task is accomplished with high accuracy and is at the same time efficient. The proposed approach achieves a good trade-off between recognition performance and speedup on data collected by an autonomous robot.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383024","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270049.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Terrain Classification Using Variable-Length Representation for Autonomous Navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fast Terrain Classification Using Variable-Length Representation for Autonomous Navigation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9737893","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270049/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Terrain Classification Using Variable-Length Representation for Autonomous Navigation","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055543S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270053,"authors":[{"name":"Shengyang Dai","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shengyang","lastName":"Dai","id":"37286707100"},{"name":"Mei Han","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Han","id":"37272698600"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278555000"},{"name":"Ying Wu","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281224100"},{"name":"Yihong Gong","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yihong","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270053","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":166,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":1017},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Color","Inverse problems","Strontium","National electric code","Laboratories","Length measurement","Image segmentation","Video compression","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","geometry","image colour analysis","image resolution","image segmentation","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alpha channel super resolution","intensity transitions","soft edge smoothness","soft cut metric","image grid","Geocuts method","intuitive geometric explanation","alpha matting technique","color image super resolution","edge segments normalization"]}],"abstract":"Effective image prior is necessary for image super resolution, due to its severely under-determined nature. Although the edge smoothness prior can be effective, it is generally difficult to have analytical forms to evaluate the edge smoothness, especially for soft edges that exhibit gradual intensity transitions. This paper finds the connection between the soft edge smoothness and a soft cut metric on an image grid by generalizing the Geocuts method (Y. Boykov and V. Kolmogorov, 2003), and proves that the soft edge smoothness measure approximates the average length of all level lines in an intensity image. This new finding not only leads to an analytical characterization of the soft edge smoothness prior, but also gives an intuitive geometric explanation. Regularizing the super resolution problem by this new form of prior can simultaneously minimize the length of all level lines, and thus resulting in visually appealing results. In addition, this paper presents a novel combination of this soft edge smoothness prior and the alpha matting technique for color image super resolution, by normalizing edge segments with their alpha channel description, to achieve a unified treatment of edges with different contrast and scale.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383028","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Edge Smoothness Prior for Alpha Channel Super Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Soft Edge Smoothness Prior for Alpha Channel Super Resolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270053/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737897","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270053/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Edge Smoothness Prior for Alpha Channel Super Resolution","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.179418S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4270054,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270054","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":200,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Image restoration","Degradation","Motion estimation","Deconvolution","Pixel","Computer science","Nonlinear filters","Additive noise","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image restoration","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion deblurring","shift-invariant linear blur filter","image deconvolution process","object boundary transparency","maximum a posteriori problem"]}],"abstract":"One of the key problems of restoring a degraded image from motion blur is the estimation of the unknown shift-invariant linear blur filter.

In this paper we propose a new pre-image method based on the Nystrom formulation for the out-of-sample extension, showing the connections between both problems. We also address the importance of normalization in the feature space, which has been ignored by standard pre-image algorithms. As an example, we apply these ideas to the Gaussian kernel, and relate our approach to other popular pre-image methods.

To find and segment objects in an image, we generate proposals based on the appearance and layout of local parts. The proposals are then refined after incorporating object-level information, and overlapping objects compete for pixels to produce a final description and segmentation of objects in the scene. A further contribution is a novel instance penalty, which is handled very efficiently during inference.

In data mining, one typically works with immense volumes of raw data, which demands effective algorithms to explore the data space. In analogy to data mining, the space of meaningful features for image analysis is also quite vast. Recently, the challenges associated with these problem areas have become more tractable through progress made in machine learning and concerted research effort in manual feature design by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a feature mining paradigm for image classification and examine several feature mining strategies. We also derive a principled approach for dealing with features with varying computational demands. Our goal is to alleviate the burden of manual feature design, which is a key problem in computer vision and machine learning. We include an in-depth empirical study on three typical data sets and offer theoretical explanations for the performance of various feature mining strategies. As a final confirmation of our ideas, we show results of a system, that utilizing feature mining strategies matches or outperforms the best reported results on pedestrian classification (where considerable effort has been devoted to expert feature design).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270071.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Mining for Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270071/","displayDocTitle":"Feature Mining for Image Classification","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737915","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Mining for Image Classification","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073247S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4270072,"authors":[{"name":"Tie Liu","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Tie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280959000"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407525400"},{"name":"Nan-Ning Zheng","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Nan-Ning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"},{"name":"Heung-Yeung Shum","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Heung-Yeung","lastName":"Shum","id":"37275914300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270072","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":656,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":3276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Image databases","Face detection","Labeling","Asia","Image segmentation","Histograms","Humans","Visual system","Physiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image segmentation","object detection","very large databases","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["salient object detection","image segmentation problem","multiscale contrast","center-surround histogram","color spatial distribution","conditional random field","large image database","visual attention algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270072","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270072.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383047","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Detect A Salient Object","abstract":"We study visual attention by detecting a salient object in an input image.

The kernels are based on soft matching of subtree-patterns of the respective graphs, leveraging the natural structure of images while remaining robust to the associated segmentation process uncertainty. Indeed, output from morphological segmentation is often represented by a labelled graph, each vertex corresponding to a segmented region, with edges joining neighboring regions. However, such image representations have mostly remained underused for learning tasks, partly because of the observed instability of the segmentation process and the inherent hardness of inexact graph matching with uncertain graphs. Our kernels count common virtual substructures amongst images, which enables to perform efficient supervised classification of natural images with a support vector machine. Moreover, the kernel machinery allows us to take advantage of recent advances in kernel-based learning: (i) semi-supervised learning reduces the required number of labelled images, while (ii) multiple kernel learning algorithms efficiently select the most relevant similarity measures between images within our family.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383049","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270074.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Classification with Segmentation Graph Kernels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Classification with Segmentation Graph Kernels","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270074/","accessionNumber":"9737918","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270074/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Classification with Segmentation Graph Kernels","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075052S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":4270075,"authors":[{"name":"Ondrej Chum","affiliation":["Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Chum","id":"37271058200"},{"name":"Andrew Zisserman","affiliation":["Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zisserman","id":"37266140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270075","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":168,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Object detection","Optimization methods","Solid modeling","Training data","Detectors","Geometry","Image edge detection","Histograms","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exemplar model","training phase","image regions","objective function","supervised training data"]}],"abstract":"We introduce an exemplar model that can learn and generate a region of interest around class instances in a training set, given only a set of images containing the visual class.

The comparative experiments show that our method can recover the occluded faces with both the global coherence and local details well preserved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270077.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-Driven Face Occlusion Detection and Recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Detectors","Quality assessment","Bayesian methods","Image sampling","Image restoration","Image reconstruction","Asia","Coherence","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","face recognition","graph theory","hidden feature removal","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality-driven face occlusion detection","occluded facial region recovery","Bayesian formulation","quality assessment model","global correlation","local patterns","GraphCut based detection","confidence-oriented sampling","face quality model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quality-Driven Face Occlusion Detection and Recovery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737921","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-Driven Face Occlusion Detection and Recovery","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058311S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270078,"authors":[{"name":"Shalini Gupta","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Shalini","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37291770400"},{"name":"J.

Furthermore, we show that in our algorithms, when anthropometric distances are replaced by distances between arbitrary regularly spaced facial points, their performances decrease substantially. This demonstrates that incorporating domain specific knowledge about the structural diversity of human faces significantly improves the performance of 3D human face recognition algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition Founded on the Structural Diversity of Human Faces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Humans","Linear discriminant analysis","Facial features","Lighting","Principal component analysis","Hidden Markov models","Biomedical engineering","Application software","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","human faces","structural diversity","facial fiducial points","anthropometric facial proportions","Euclidean/geodesic distances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition Founded on the Structural Diversity of Human Faces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270078/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737922","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition Founded on the Structural Diversity of Human Faces","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120237S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270079,"authors":[{"name":"Deng Cai","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Deng","lastName":"Cai","id":"37411632000"},{"name":"Xiaofei He","affiliation":["Yahoo Research Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"He","id":"37407014800"},{"name":"Yuxiao Hu","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Yuxiao","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277447600"},{"name":"Jiawei Han","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Han","id":"37276626200"},{"name":"Thomas Huang","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275421800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270079","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":215,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1328},"abstract":"Subspace learning based face recognition methods have attracted considerable interests in recently years, including principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), locality preserving projection (LPP), neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE), marginal fisher analysis (MFA) and local discriminant embedding (LDE).

Recognition, clustering and retrieval can be then performed in the image subspace. Experimental results on face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270079.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning a Spatially Smooth Subspace for Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Pixel","Vectors","Laplace equations","Subspace constraints","Clustering algorithms","Image representation","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially smooth subspace","face recognition","principal component analysis","linear discriminant analysis","locality preserving projection","neighborhood preserving embedding","marginal fisher analysis","local discriminant embedding","Laplacian penalty","learning algorithms","image representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Learning a Spatially Smooth Subspace for Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270079/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737923","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning a Spatially Smooth Subspace for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088611S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270080,"authors":[{"name":"Jinli Suo","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Jinli","lastName":"Suo","id":"37390948800"},{"name":"Feng Min","affiliation":["IPRAI, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Min","id":"37391550300"},{"name":"Songchun Zhu","affiliation":["Lotus Hill Institute of Computer Vision and Information Science, China"],"firstName":"Songchun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281407500"},{"name":"Shiguang Shan","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Shiguang","lastName":"Shan","id":"37271963900"},{"name":"Xilin Chen","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xilin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278215600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270080","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":723},"abstract":"In this paper we present a dynamic model for simulating face aging process.

Our models improve existing language models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) by modeling interactions without supervision. Our data sets are challenging video sequences from crowded traffic scenes with many kinds of activities co-occurring.

Flash cut is based on the simple observation that only the foreground is significantly brightened by the flash and the background appearance change is very small, if the background is distant. Changes due to flash, motion, and color information are fused in an MRF framework to produce high quality segmentation results. Flash cut handles some amount of camera shake, and foreground motion, which makes it practical for anyone with a flash-equipped camera to use.

Since images are very non Gaussian, high dimensional, continuous signals, learning their distribution presents a tremendous computational challenge. Perhaps the most successful recent algorithm is the Fields of Experts (FOE) [20] model which has shown impressive performance by modeling image statistics with a product of potentials defined on filter outputs. However, as in previous models of images based on filter outputs [30], calculating the probability of an image given the model requires evaluating an intractable partition function. This makes learning very slow (requires Monte-Carlo sampling at every step) and makes it virtually impossible to compare the likelihood of two different models. Given this computational difficulty, it is hard to say whether nonintu-itive features learned by such models represent a true property of natural images or an artifact of the approximations used during learning. In this paper we present (1) tractable lower and upper bounds on the partition function of models based on filter outputs and (2) efficient learning algorithms that do not require any sampling. Our results are based on recent results in machine learning that deal with Gaussian potentials. We extend these results to non-Gaussian potentials and derive a novel, basis rotation algorithm for approximating the maximum likelihood filters. Our results allow us to (1) rigorously compare the likelihood of different models and (2) calculate high likelihood models of natural image statistics in a matter of minutes. Applying our results to previous models shows that the nonintuitive features are not an artifact of the learning process but rather are capturing robust properties of natural images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383092","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270117.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What makes a good model of natural images?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270117/","displayDocTitle":"What makes a good model of natural images?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737971","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270117/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What makes a good model of natural images?","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109194S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4270119,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Potetz","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Potetz","id":"37936496500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270119","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belief propagation","Computer vision","Application software","Probability distribution","Reflectivity","Markov random fields","Higher order statistics","Graphical models","Stereo vision","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","computer vision","Markov processes","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision belief propagation","linear constraint nodes","pairwise connected Markov random fields","computer vision problems","pairwise interactions","higher-order interactions","real-valued variables","shape-from-shading techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270119","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270119.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Belief Propagation for Vision Using Linear Constraint Nodes","abstract":"Belief propagation over pairwise connected Markov random fields has become a widely used approach, and has been successfully applied to several important computer vision problems. However, pairwise interactions are often insufficient to capture the full statistics of the problem. Higher-order interactions are sometimes required. Unfortunately, the complexity of belief propagation is exponential in the size of the largest clique. In this paper, we introduce a new technique to compute belief propagation messages in time linear with respect to clique size for a large class of potential functions over real-valued variables. We demonstrate this technique in two applications. First, we perform efficient inference in graphical models where the spatial prior of natural images is captured by 2 times 2 cliques. This approach shows significant improvement over the commonly used pairwise-connected models, and may benefit a variety of applications using belief propagation to infer images or range images. Finally, we apply these techniques to shape-from-shading and demonstrate significant improvement over previous methods, both in quality and in flexibility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270119/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737973","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Belief Propagation for Vision Using Linear Constraint Nodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Belief Propagation for Vision Using Linear Constraint Nodes","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067673S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270123,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Verbeek","affiliation":["LJK, INRIA, Montbonnot, France"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Verbeek","id":"37397584100"},{"name":"Bill Triggs","affiliation":["LJK, INRIA, Montbonnot, France"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Triggs","id":"37282698000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270123","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":125,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":558},"abstract":"Considerable advances have been made in learning to recognize and localize visual object classes. Simple bag-of-feature approaches label each pixel or patch independently. More advanced models attempt to improve the coherence of the labellings by introducing some form of inter-patch coupling: traditional spatial models such as MRF's provide crisper local labellings by exploiting neighbourhood-level couplings, while aspect models such as PLSA and LDA use global relevance estimates (global mixing proportions for the classes appearing in the image) to shape the local choices. We point out that the two approaches are complementary, combining them to produce aspect-based spatial field models that outperform both approaches. We study two spatial models: one based on averaging over forests of minimal spanning trees linking neighboring image regions, the other on an efficient chain-based Expectation Propagation method for regular 8-neighbor Markov random fields. The models can be trained using either patch-level labels or image-level keywords. As input features they use factored observation models combining texture, color and position cues. Experimental results on the MSR Cambridge data sets show that combining spatial and aspect models significantly improves the region-level classification accuracy. In fact our models trained with image-level labels outperform PLSA trained with pixel-level ones.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270123.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region Classification with Markov Field Aspect Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Labeling","Image segmentation","Pixel","Linear discriminant analysis","Animals","Coherence","Joining processes","Markov random fields","Computer vision","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region classification","Markov field aspect models","bag-of-feature approaches","local labellings","neighbourhood-level couplings","global relevance estimates","expectation propagation method","Markov random fields","patch-level labels","image-level keywords"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Region Classification with Markov Field Aspect Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270123/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737977","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region Classification with Markov Field Aspect Models","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058126S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4270124,"authors":[{"name":"Lior Wolf","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Lior","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37411189600"},{"name":"Hueihan Jhuang","affiliation":["M.I.T., USA"],"firstName":"Hueihan","lastName":"Jhuang","id":"37825385900"},{"name":"Tamir Hazan","affiliation":["School of Engineering and CS, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Tamir","lastName":"Hazan","id":"37550038800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270124","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270124","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Pixel","Principal component analysis","Matrix decomposition","Computer science","Image analysis","Particle separators","Multidimensional systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Concatenated codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","matrix algebra","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modeling appearances","low-rank SVM","spatial relations","image measurements","coupled subspace analysis","discriminative learning stage","low-rank separators","low-rank matrices"]}],"abstract":"Several authors have noticed that the common representation of images as vectors is sub-optimal. The process of vectorization eliminates spatial relations between some of the nearby image measurements and produces a vector of a dimension which is the product of the measurements' dimensions. It seems that images may be better represented when taking into account their structure as a 2D (or multi-D) array. Our work bears similarities to recent work such as 2DPCA or Coupled Subspace Analysis in that we treat images as 2D arrays. The main difference, however, is that unlike previous work which separated representation from the discriminative learning stage, we achieve both by the same method. Our framework, \"low-rank separators \", studies the use of a separating hyperplane which are constrained to have the structure of low-rank matrices. We first prove that the low-rank constraint provides preferable generalization properties. We then define two \"low-rank SVM problems\" and propose algorithms to solve these. Finally, we provide supporting experimental evidence for the framework.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383099","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270124.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Appearances with Low-Rank SVM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270124/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Appearances with Low-Rank SVM","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737978","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270124/","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Appearances with Low-Rank SVM","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070204S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270129,"authors":[{"name":"Zhifeng Li","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37279080100"},{"name":"Dahua Lin","affiliation":["Department of IE, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Dahua","lastName":"Lin","id":"37416122100"},{"name":"Helen Meng","affiliation":["Department of SEEM, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Meng","id":"37276215600"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of IE, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270129","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Image recognition","Reflectivity","Hidden Markov models","Asia","Lighting control","System testing","Performance evaluation","Probes","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image fusion","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminant mutual subspace learning","indoor face recognition","outdoor face recognition","face image","multiclassifier fusion framework","Gabor images","adaptive informative fusion scheme"]}],"abstract":"Outdoor face recognition is among the most challenging problems for face recognition.

To further improve the recognition performance we develop a DMSL-based multi-classifier fusion framework on Gabor images using a new fusion method called adaptive informative fusion scheme. Experimental results clearly show that this framework can greatly enhance the recognition performance.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383104","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminant Mutual Subspace Learning for Indoor and Outdoor Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant Mutual Subspace Learning for Indoor and Outdoor Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270129/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737983","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270129/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant Mutual Subspace Learning for Indoor and Outdoor Face Recognition","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048058S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270130,"authors":[{"name":"Senjian An","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Senjian","lastName":"An","id":"37277638600"},{"name":"Wanquan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Wanquan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279767200"},{"name":"Svetha Venkatesh","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Svetha","lastName":"Venkatesh","id":"37279180300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270130","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Kernel","Linear discriminant analysis","Principal component analysis","Australia","Image recognition","Target recognition","Image databases","Supervised learning","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","kernel ridge regression","multivariate labels","cross-validation algorithm","orthogonal Laplacianfaces"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Using Kernel Ridge Regression","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270130.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383105","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270130","abstract":"In this paper, we present novel ridge regression (RR) and kernel ridge regression (KRR) techniques for multivariate labels and apply the methods to the problem efface recognition.

We identify the new face image by mapping it into this face subspace and comparing its distance to all individual targets. An efficient cross-validation algorithm is also provided for selecting the regularization and kernel parameters. Experiments were conducted on two face databases and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the three popular linear face recognition techniques (Eigenfaces, Fisher faces and Laplacian faces) and also performs comparably with the recently developed Orthogonal Laplacian faces with the advantage of computational speed. Experimental results also demonstrate that KRR outperforms RR as expected since KRR can utilize the nonlinear structure of the face images.

In this formulation images are treated as tensors, rather than the more conventional vector of pixels. Projections are pursued sequentially and take the form of a rank one tensor, i.e., a tensor which is the outer product of a set of vectors. A novel and effective technique is proposed to ensure that the rank one tensor projections are orthogonal to one another. These constraints on the tensor projections provide a strong inductive bias and result in better generalization on small training sets. Our work is related to spectrum methods, which achieve orthogonal rank one projections by pursuing consecutive projections in the complement space of previous projections. Although this may be meaningful for applications such as reconstruction, it is less meaningful for pursuing discriminant projections. Our new scheme iteratively solves an eigenvalue problem with orthogonality constraints on one dimension, and solves unconstrained eigenvalue problems on the other dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that on small and medium sized face recognition datasets, this approach outperforms previous embedding methods. On large face datasets this approach achieves results comparable with the best, often using fewer discriminant projections.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition using Discriminatively Trained Orthogonal Rank One Tensor Projections","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383107","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270132.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition using Discriminatively Trained Orthogonal Rank One Tensor Projections","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270132/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9900636","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition using Discriminatively Trained Orthogonal Rank One Tensor Projections","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036285S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4270132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4270148,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Ozuysal","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9deral de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Ozuysal","id":"37660396200"},{"name":"Pascal Fua","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9deral de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Fua","id":"37281288800"},{"name":"Vincent Lepetit","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9deral de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Lepetit","id":"37281250600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270148","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":233,"citationCountPatent":33,"totalDownloads":2712},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Robustness","Computer vision","Bayesian methods","Image recognition","Testing","Image retrieval","Laboratories","Image registration","Casting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image recognition","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["keypoint recognition","ten lines","object detection","patch preprocessing","perspective distortion","Naive Bayesian classification framework","class posterior probabilities","image datasets","code"]}],"abstract":"While feature point recognition is a key component of modern approaches to object detection, existing approaches require computationally expensive patch preprocessing to handle perspective distortion. In this paper, we show that formulating the problem in a Naive Bayesian classification framework makes such preprocessing unnecessary and produces an algorithm that is simple, efficient, and robust. Furthermore, it scales well to handle large number of classes. To recognize the patches surrounding keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class posterior probabilities.

Even though this is not strictly true, we demonstrate that our classifier nevertheless performs remarkably well on image datasets containing very significant perspective changes.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383123","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270148.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383123","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Keypoint Recognition in Ten Lines of Code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fast Keypoint Recognition in Ten Lines of Code","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270148/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270148/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738001","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Keypoint Recognition in Ten Lines of Code","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061286S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4270149,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technologies and Systems Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37557037200"},{"name":"Changshui Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technologies and Systems Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changshui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274216800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270149","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":654},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Linear discriminant analysis","Principal component analysis","Tensile stress","Data mining","Computer vision","Scattering","Pattern recognition","Covariance matrix","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","feature extraction","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average neighborhood margin maximization","ANMM","supervised linear feature extraction","linear discriminant analysis","computer vision","face recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270149","abstract":"A novel algorithm called Average Neighborhood Margin Maximization (ANMM) is proposed for supervised linear feature extraction.

We will show that features extracted from ANMM can separate the data from different classes well, and it avoids the small sample size problem existed in traditional Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The kernelized (nonlinear) counterpart of ANMM is also established in this paper. Moreover, as in many computer vision applications the data are more naturally represented by higher order tensors (e.g. images and videos), we develop a tensorized (multilinear) form of ANMM, which can directly extract features from tensors.

We present an approach that does not explicitly infer 3D pose at each frame. Instead, from existing action models we search for a series of actions that best match the input sequence. In our approach, each action is modeled as a series of synthetic 2D human poses rendered from a wide range of viewpoints. The constraints on transition of the synthetic poses is represented by a graph model called Action Net. Given the input, silhouette matching between the input frames and the key poses is performed first using an enhanced Pyramid Match Kernel algorithm.

We introduce an algorithm for learning shapelet features, a set of mid-level features. These features are focused on local regions of the image and are built from low-level gradient information that discriminates between pedestrian and non-pedestrian classes. Using Ad-aBoost, these shapelet features are created as a combination of oriented gradient responses. To train the final classifier, we use AdaBoost for a second time to select a subset of our learned shapelets.

By tensor CCA, joint space-time linear relationships of two video volumes are inspected to yield flexible and descriptive similarity features of the two videos. The TCCA features are combined with a discriminative feature selection scheme and a nearest neighbor classifier for action classification. In addition, we propose a time-efficient action detection method based on dynamic learning of subspaces for tensor CCA for the case that actions are not aligned in the space-time domain. The proposed method delivered significantly better accuracy and comparable detection speed over state-of-the-art methods on the KTH action data set as well as self-recorded hand gesture data sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270162.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis for Action Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Videos","Humans","Image motion analysis","Nearest neighbor searches","Data mining","Support vector machines","Shape","Functional analysis","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gesture recognition","image classification","linear algebra","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor canonical correlation analysis","action classification","multidimensional data arrays","gesture classification","videos","joint space-time linear relationships","discriminative feature selection scheme","nearest neighbor classifier","multilinear algebra"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis for Action Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738015","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis for Action Classification","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098608S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4270171,"authors":[{"name":"Bastian Leibe","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bastian","lastName":"Leibe","id":"37298473000"},{"name":"Nico Cornelis","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Cornelis","id":"37298475900"},{"name":"Kurt Cornelis","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Cornelis","id":"37277171500"},{"name":"Luc Van Gool","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van Gool","id":"37277167600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270171","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":176,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":1877},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle dynamics","Image analysis","Vehicles","Layout","Object detection","Geometry","Trajectory","Streaming media","Object recognition","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","object detection","object recognition","traffic engineering computing","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D scene analysis","moving vehicle","automatic scene geometry estimation","2D object detection","3D localization","trajectory estimation","structure-from-motion","object recognition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a system that integrates fully automatic scene geometry estimation, 2D object detection, 3D localization, trajectory estimation, and tracking for dynamic scene interpretation from a moving vehicle. Our sole input are two video streams from a calibrated stereo rig on top of a car. From these streams, we estimate structure-from-motion (SfM) and scene geometry in real-time. In parallel, we perform multi-view/multi-category object recognition to detect cars and pedestrians in both camera images. Using the SfM self-localization, 2D object detections are converted to 3D observations, which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame. A subsequent tracking module analyzes the resulting 3D observations to find physically plausible spacetime trajectories. Finally, a global optimization criterion takes object-object interactions into account to arrive at accurate 3D localization and trajectory estimates for both cars and pedestrians. We demonstrate the performance of our integrated system on challenging real-world data showing car passages through crowded city areas.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383146","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270171.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic 3D Scene Analysis from a Moving Vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270171/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic 3D Scene Analysis from a Moving Vehicle","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738024","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270171/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic 3D Scene Analysis from a Moving Vehicle","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08738S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270175,"authors":[{"name":"Grant Schindler","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Grant","lastName":"Schindler","id":"37268188300"},{"name":"Matthew Brown","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Brown","id":"37403600800"},{"name":"Richard Szeliski","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Szeliski","id":"37282879100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270175","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":397,"citationCountPatent":47,"totalDownloads":1484},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vocabulary","Image databases","Spatial databases","Image recognition","Object recognition","Buildings","Image storage","Visual databases","Cities and towns","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image retrieval","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["city-scale location recognition","vocabulary tree","query image","feature matching","image retrieval"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270175","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383150","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","abstract":"We look at the problem of location recognition in a large image dataset using a vocabulary tree.

Adopting this modeling strategy we both (i) automatically decompose objects into a hierarchy of relevant compositions and we (ii) learn such a compositional representation for each category without supervision. The compositional structure supports feature sharing already on the lowest level of small image patches. Compositions are represented as probability distributions over their constituent parts and the relations between them. The global shape of objects is captured by a graphical model which combines all compositions. Inference based on the underlying statistical model is then employed to obtain a category level object recognition system.

The resulting optimal step nonrigid ICP framework allows the use of different regularisations, as long as they have an adjustable stiffness parameter. The registration loops over a series of decreasing stiffness weights, and incrementally deforms the template towards the target, recovering the whole range of global and local deformations. To find the optimal deformation for a given stiffness, optimal iterative closest point steps are used. Preliminary correspondences are estimated by a nearest-point search. Then the optimal deformation of the template for these fixed correspondences and the active stiffness is calculated. Afterwards the process continues with new correspondences found by searching from the displaced template vertices. We present an algorithm using a locally affine regularisation which assigns an affine transformation to each vertex and minimises the difference in the transformation of neighbouring vertices. It is shown that for this regularisation the optimal deformation for fixed correspondences and fixed stiffness can be determined exactly and efficiently. The method succeeds for a wide range of initial conditions, and handles missing data robustly. It is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other algorithms using synthetic examples and real world data.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383165","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270190.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Step Nonrigid ICP Algorithms for Surface Registration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270190/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Step Nonrigid ICP Algorithms for Surface Registration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738043","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270190/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Step Nonrigid ICP Algorithms for Surface Registration","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073234S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"288","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4270197,"authors":[{"name":"James Philbin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Philbin","id":"37332404900"},{"name":"Ondrej Chum","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Chum","id":"37271058200"},{"name":"Michael Isard","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Isard","id":"37282933400"},{"name":"Josef Sivic","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Sivic","id":"37282919700"},{"name":"Andrew Zisserman","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zisserman","id":"37266140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270197","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1606,"citationCountPatent":59,"totalDownloads":7020},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vocabulary","Image retrieval","Quantization","Information filtering","Information filters","Silicon","Large-scale systems","Scalability","Humans","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image retrieval","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object retrieval","large vocabularies","fast spatial matching","large-scale object retrieval system","query object","query image","image-feature vocabulary","scalable methods","quantization method","query performance","spatial verification stage","Web-scale image corpora"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270197","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270197.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383172","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object retrieval with large vocabularies and fast spatial matching","abstract":"In this paper, we present a large-scale object retrieval system. The user supplies a query object by selecting a region of a query image, and the system returns a ranked list of images that contain the same object, retrieved from a large corpus. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view this work as a promising step towards much larger, \"web-scale \" image corpora.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270197/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9738061","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270197/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Object retrieval with large vocabularies and fast spatial matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object retrieval with large vocabularies and fast spatial matching","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073339S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"1606","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4270198,"authors":[{"name":"Ariadna Quattoni","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Ariadna","lastName":"Quattoni","id":"37829080100"},{"name":"Michael Collins","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Collins","id":"37272162300"},{"name":"Trevor Darrell","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Darrell","id":"37282910600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270198","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270198","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image representation","Learning","Image classification","Principal component analysis","Vectors","Computer science","Artificial intelligence","Laboratories","Training data","Natural languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual representation learning","image caption","visual category learning","image representation learning","image category","unlabeled image","image classification","labeled data","meta-data"]}],"abstract":"Current methods for learning visual categories work well when a large amount of labeled data is available, but can run into severe difficulties when the number of labeled examples is small. When labeled data is scarce it may be beneficial to use unlabeled data to learn an image representation that is low-dimensional, but nevertheless captures the information required to discriminate between image categories. This paper describes a method for learning representations from large quantities of unlabeled images which have associated captions; the goal is to improve learning in future image classification problems. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms (1) a fully-supervised baseline model, (2) a model that ignores the captions and learns a visual representation by performing PCA on the unlabeled images alone and (3) a model that uses the output of word classifiers trained using captions and unlabeled data. Our current work concentrates on captions as the source of meta-data, but more generally other types of meta-data could be used.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383173","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270198.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Visual Representations using Images with Captions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Learning Visual Representations using Images with Captions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270198/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738062","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270198/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Visual Representations using Images with Captions","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076836S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270202,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Ren","affiliation":["Toyota Technical Institute, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Ren","id":"37271421900"},{"name":"Jitendra Malik","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Malik","id":"37282929000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270202","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":555},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Image segmentation","Coherence","Layout","Computer science","Brightness","Belief propagation","Nonlinear optics","Image motion analysis","Maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image segmentation","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["repeated ground segmentation","repeated figure segmentation","nonrigid objects reliable tracking","static image","temporal coherence cues","superpixel-based conditional random field","sports video sequences","figure skating"]}],"abstract":"Tracking over a long period of time is challenging as the appearance, shape and scale of the object in question may vary. We propose a paradigm of tracking by repeatedly segmenting figure from background. Accurate spatial support obtained in segmentation provides rich information about the track and enables reliable tracking of non-rigid objects without drifting. Figure/ground segmentation operates sequentially in each frame by utilizing both static image cues and temporal coherence cues, which include an appearance model of brightness (or color) and a spatial model propagating figure/ground masks through low-level region correspondence. A superpixel-based conditional random field linearly combines cues and loopy belief propagation is used to estimate marginal posteriors of figure vs background. We demonstrate our approach on long sequences of sports video, including figure skating and football.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383177","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking as Repeated Figure/Ground Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking as Repeated Figure/Ground Segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270202/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738066","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270202/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking as Repeated Figure/Ground Segmentation","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067735S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270205,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Jiang","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272623700"},{"name":"Sidney Fels","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sidney","lastName":"Fels","id":"37268066200"},{"name":"James J.

The problem of minimizing the number of samples required for robust distribution matching is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with the specified probability as the objective function. We show that surprisingly mean-shift tracking using our method requires very few samples. Our experiments demonstrate that robust tracking can be achieved with even as few as 5 random samples from the distribution of the target candidate.

Each hidden state in the 3D MRF model represents a pixel's motion likelihood and is estimated using message passing in a 6-connected spatio-temporal neighborhood. This approach deals effectively with difficult moving object detection problems like objects camouflaged by similar appearance to the background, or objects with uniform color that frame difference methods can only partially detect.

We present experimental results illustrating the potential of our approach for automatically learning the parameters of models with richer structure than standard hand-tuned MRF models.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383191","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270216.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383191","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Conditional Random Fields for Stereo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Learning Conditional Random Fields for Stereo","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270216/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270216/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738080","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Conditional Random Fields for Stereo","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123122S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"464","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4270218,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Hernandez","affiliation":["Computer Vision Group, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, UK","Computer Vision Group, Toshiba Research Europe"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Hernandez","id":"37593450500"},{"name":"George Vogiatzis","affiliation":["Computer Vision Group, Toshiba Research Europe"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Vogiatzis","id":"37418687600"},{"name":"Roberto Cipolla","affiliation":["Dept. of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Cipolla","id":"37298556800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270218","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Surface reconstruction","Stereo vision","Computer vision","Europe","Layout","Cameras","Stereo image processing","Surface treatment","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image resolution","image segmentation","probability","solid modelling","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiview stereo","probabilistic 3D segmentation","foreground model","background model","3D location prediction","probabilistic visibility","multiresolution graph-cut implementation","ballooning term","3D modelling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270218","abstract":"We present a new formulation to multi-view stereo that treats the problem as probabilistic 3D segmentation.

What is correlated across images (or across video sequences) is the internal layout of local self-similarities (up to some distortions), even though the patterns generating those local self-similarities are quite different in each of the images/videos. These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local \"self-similarity descriptor\"', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning. We compare our measure to commonly used image-based and video-based similarity measures, and demonstrate its applicability to object detection, retrieval, and action detection.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270223.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching Local Self-Similarities across Images and Videos","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Matching Local Self-Similarities across Images and Videos","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738087","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270223/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching Local Self-Similarities across Images and Videos","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068739S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"602","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4270228,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Rother","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Rother","id":"37326487100"},{"name":"Vladimir Kolmogorov","affiliation":["University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Kolmogorov","id":"37279665800"},{"name":"Victor Lempitsky","affiliation":["Moscow State University, Russia"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lempitsky","id":"37332794000"},{"name":"Martin Szummer","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Szummer","id":"37270958700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270228","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":266,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":833},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Application software","Labeling","Image segmentation","Energy resolution","Image resolution","Image recognition","Image restoration","Deconvolution","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image recognition","image resolution","image restoration","image segmentation","image texture","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimizing binary MRF","extended roof duality","computer vision","graph cut","probing technique","image segmentation","view synthesis","image resolution","diagram recognition","parameter learning","texture restoration","image deconvolution","Markov random field"]}],"abstract":"Many computer vision applications rely on the efficient optimization of challenging, so-called non-submodular, binary pairwise MRFs. A promising graph cut based approach for optimizing such MRFs known as \"roof duality\" was recently introduced into computer vision. We study two methods which extend this approach. First, we discuss an efficient implementation of the \"probing\" technique introduced recently by Bows et al. (2006). It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global optimum. Our code is 400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of the work of Bows et al. (2006). Second, we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary input labeling and tries to improve its energy. We give theoretical characterizations of local minima of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications, including image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition, parameter learning, texture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several applications we see that we are able to find the global minimum very efficiently, and considerably outperform the original roof duality approach. In comparison to existing techniques, such as graph cut, TRW, BP, ICM, and simulated annealing, we nearly always find a lower energy.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383203","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Binary MRFs via Extended Roof Duality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Binary MRFs via Extended Roof Duality","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270228/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738092","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270228/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Binary MRFs via Extended Roof Duality","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078813S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270229,"authors":[{"name":"Pushmeet Kohli","affiliation":["Oxford Brookes University, UK"],"firstName":"Pushmeet","lastName":"Kohli","id":"37408096000"},{"name":"M.

As a consequence, no algorithm can be considered as universal. However, with the large variety of available methods, the question is how to select the method that induces equivalent classes for different image characteristics. Furthermore, the subsequent question is how to combine the different algorithms in a proper way. To achieve selection and combining of color constancy algorithms, in this paper, natural image statistics are used to identify the most important characteristics of color images. Then, based on these image characteristics, the proper color constancy algorithm (or best combination of algorithms) is selected for a specific image. To capture the image characteristics, the Weibull parameterization (e.g. texture and contrast) is used. Experiments show that, on a large data set of 11,000 images, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art single algorithms, as well as simple alternatives for combining several algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383206","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270231.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Constancy using Natural Image Statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Color Constancy using Natural Image Statistics","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9738095","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270231/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Constancy using Natural Image Statistics","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074381S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4270236,"authors":[{"name":"Qingxiong Yang","affiliation":["University of Kentucky, USA"],"firstName":"Qingxiong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37288953600"},{"name":"Ruigang Yang","affiliation":["University of Kentucky, USA"],"firstName":"Ruigang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37277874700"},{"name":"James Davis","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Davis","id":"38183303700"},{"name":"David Nister","affiliation":["University of Kentucky, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Nister","id":"37282920200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270236","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":440,"citationCountPatent":33,"totalDownloads":5105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Filters","Stereo vision","Time measurement","Pulse measurements","Cost function","Color","Markov random fields","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image enhancement","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial-depth super resolution","image resolution enhancement","high-resolution color images","middlebury benchmark","subpixel accuracy"]}],"abstract":"We present a new post-processing step to enhance the resolution of range images.

We also demonstrated its effectiveness for spatial resolution enhancement up to 100 times with a single reference image.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-Depth Super Resolution for Range Images","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383211","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270236.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-Depth Super Resolution for Range Images","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270236/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738100","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-Depth Super Resolution for Range Images","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051315S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"440","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4270250,"authors":[{"name":"Kristen Grauman","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kristen","lastName":"Grauman","id":"37282612200"},{"name":"Trevor Darrell","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Darrell","id":"37282910600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270250","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"abstract":"Matching local features across images is often useful when comparing or recognizing objects or scenes, and efficient techniques for obtaining image-to-image correspondences have been developed [4, 11, 16].

Since point trajectories associated with different motions live in different manifolds, traditional approaches deal with only one manifold type: linear subspaces for affine views, and homographic, bilinear and trilinear varieties for two and three perspective views. As real motion sequences contain motions of different types, we cast motion segmentation as a problem of clustering manifolds of different types. Rather than explicitly modeling each manifold as a linear, bilinear or multilinear variety, we use nonlinear dimensionality reduction to learn a low-dimensional representation of the union of all manifolds. We show that for a union of separated manifolds, the LLE algorithm computes a matrix whose null space contains vectors giving the segmentation of the data. An analysis of the variance of these vectors allows us to distinguish them from other vectors in the null space. This leads to a new algorithm for clustering both linear and nonlinear manifolds. Although this algorithm is theoretically designed for separated manifolds, our experiments demonstrate its performance on real data where this assumption does not hold. We test our algorithm on the Hopkins 155 motion segmentation database and achieve an average classification error of 4.8%, which compares favorably against state-of-the art multiframe motion segmentation methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738124","htmlLink":"/document/4270260/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmenting Motions of Different Types by Unsupervised Manifold Clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmenting Motions of Different Types by Unsupervised Manifold Clustering","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057064S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4270273,"authors":[{"name":"Heiko Hirschmuller","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Hirschmuller","id":"37295459200"},{"name":"Daniel Scharstein","affiliation":["Middlebury College, Middlebury, VT, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Scharstein","id":"37353762600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270273","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":588,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":3819},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Filters","Radiometry","Histograms","Entropy","Pixel","Mutual information","Light sources","Testing","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost functions","stereo matching","image locations similarity","radiometric variations","pixel-based variants","window-based variants","intensity changes"]}],"abstract":"Stereo correspondence methods rely on matching costs for computing the similarity of image locations.

An onboard vision system should take fog effects into account. The effects of fog varies across the scene and are exponential with respect to the depth of scene points. Because it is not possible in this context to compute the road scene structure beforehand contrary to fixed camera surveillance, a new scheme is proposed. Weather conditions are first estimated and then used to restore the contrast according to a scene structure which is inferred a priori and refined during the restoration process. Based on the aimed application, different algorithms with increasing complexities are proposed. Results are presented using sample road scenes under foggy weather and assessed by computing the contrast before and after restoration.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383259","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Fog-Free In-Vehicle Vision Systems through Contrast Restoration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Fog-Free In-Vehicle Vision Systems through Contrast Restoration","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270284/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738148","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270284/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Fog-Free In-Vehicle Vision Systems through Contrast Restoration","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065548S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4270290,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Liu","affiliation":["Visualization and Computer Vision Laboratory, General Electric Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37336814700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270290","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active appearance model","Shape","Magnesium compounds","Face detection","Computer vision","Iterative algorithms","Robustness","Optimization methods","Boosting","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","gradient methods","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generic face alignment","boosted appearance model","active appearance models","iterative image alignment","conventional point distribution model","gradient ascent method"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a discriminative framework for efficiently aligning images. Although conventional active appearance models (AAM)-based approaches have achieved some success, they suffer from the generalization problem, i.e., how to align any image with a generic model. We treat the iterative image alignment problem as a process of maximizing the score of a trained two-class classifier that is able to distinguish correct alignment (positive class) from incorrect alignment (negative class). During the modeling stage, given a set of images with ground truth landmarks, we train a conventional point distribution model (PDM) and a boosting-based classifier, which we call boosted appearance model (BAM). When tested on an image with the initial landmark locations, the proposed algorithm iteratively updates the shape parameters of the PDM via the gradient ascent method such that the classification score of the warped image is maximized. The proposed framework is applied to the face alignment problem. Using extensive experimentation, we show that, compared to the AAM-based approach, this framework greatly improves the robustness, accuracy and efficiency of face alignment by a large margin, especially for unseen data.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383265","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270290.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic Face Alignment using Boosted Appearance Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270290/","displayDocTitle":"Generic Face Alignment using Boosted Appearance Model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738154","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270290/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic Face Alignment using Boosted Appearance Model","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055571S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4270291,"authors":[{"name":"Florent Perronnin","affiliation":["Xerox Research Centre Europe, Meylan, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Perronnin","id":"37285162600"},{"name":"Christopher Dance","affiliation":["Xerox Research Centre Europe, Meylan, France"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Dance","id":"37736828100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270291","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":843,"citationCountPatent":59,"totalDownloads":4227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Vocabulary","Image databases","Spatial databases","Signal generators","Visual databases","Pattern classification","Power generation","Character generation","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","gradient methods","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fisher kernels","visual vocabularies","image categorization","pattern classification","gradient vector","generative probability model","Gaussian mixture model"]}],"abstract":"Within the field of pattern classification, the Fisher kernel is a powerful framework which combines the strengths of generative and discriminative approaches. The idea is to characterize a signal with a gradient vector derived from a generative probability model and to subsequently feed this representation to a discriminative classifier. We propose to apply this framework to image categorization where the input signals are images and where the underlying generative model is a visual vocabulary: a Gaussian mixture model which approximates the distribution of low-level features in images. We show that Fisher kernels can actually be understood as an extension of the popular bag-of-visterms. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance on two challenging databases: an in-house database of 19 object/scene categories and the recently released VOC 2006 database.

Scanning-window template classifiers are the current state-of-the-art for many object classes such as faces, cars, and pedestrians. Such approaches, though quite successful, can be hindered by their lack of explicit encoding of object shape/structure - one might, for example, find faces in trees. We adopt the following strategy; we first use these systems as attention mechanisms, generating many possible object locations by tuning them for low missed-detections and high false-positives. At each hypothesized detection, we compute a local figure-ground segmentation using a window of slightly larger extent than that used by the classifier. This segmentation task is guided by top-down knowledge. We learn offline from training data those segmentations that are consistent with true positives. We then prune away those hypotheses with bad segmentations. We show this strategy leads to significant improvements (10-20%) over established approaches such as ViolaJones and DalalTriggs on a variety of benchmark datasets including the PASCAL challenge, LabelMe, and the INRIAPerson dataset.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383271","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Segmentation to Verify Object Hypotheses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using Segmentation to Verify Object Hypotheses","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270296/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738171","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270296/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Segmentation to Verify Object Hypotheses","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0524S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4270297,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Marszalek","affiliation":["LEAR-LJK, INRIA, Montbonnot, France"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Marszalek","id":"37891667500"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR-LJK, INRIA, Montbonnot, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270297","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":165,"citationCountPatent":33,"totalDownloads":938},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Object detection","Humans","Vehicle detection","Detectors","Machine vision","Animals","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Dogs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference mechanisms","object detection","object recognition","semantic networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic hierarchies","visual object recognition","lexical semantic networks","image labels semantics","visual appearance learning","object detection","classification accuracy","semantic inference tools"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose to use lexical semantic networks to extend the state-of-the-art object recognition techniques.

This paper proposes a detector ensemble model that consists of a set of substructure-detectors, each of which is composed of several part-detectors. Two important issues are studied both in theory and in practice, (1) finding an optimal detector ensemble, and (2) detecting targets based on an ensemble. Based on some theoretical analysis, a new model selection strategy is proposed to learn an optimal detector ensemble that has a minimum number of false positives and satisfies the design requirement on the capacity of tolerating missing parts. In addition, this paper also links ensemble-based detection to the inference in Markov random field, and shows that the target detection can be done by a max-product belief propagation algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270299/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9738174","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Detector Ensemble","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detector Ensemble","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058288S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4270302,"authors":[{"name":"Yueming Wang","affiliation":["College of Compute Science, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407555700"},{"name":"Gang Pan","affiliation":["College of Compute Science, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37280913000"},{"name":"Zhaohui Wu","affiliation":["College of Compute Science, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37065625600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270302","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"abstract":"Three-dimensional human face recognition in the presence of expression is a big challenge, since the shape distortion caused by facial expression greatly weakens the rigid matching. This paper proposes a guidance-based constraint deformation(GCD) model to cope with the shape distortion by expression. The basic idea is that, the face model with non-neutral expression is deformed toward its neutral one under certain constraint so that the distortion is reduced while inter-class discriminative information is preserved. The GCD model exploits the neutral 3D face shape to guide the deformation, meanwhile applies a rigid constraint on it. Both steps are smoothly unified in the Poisson equation framework. The GCD approach only needs one neutral model for each person in the gallery. The experimental results, carried out on the large 3D face databases-FRGC v2.0, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms ICP method for both identification and authentication mode. It shows the GCD model is promising for coping with the shape distortion in 3D face recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270302.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition in the Presence of Expression: A Guidance-based Constraint Deformation Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Deformable models","Probes","Humans","Surface treatment","Shape measurement","Educational institutions","Poisson equations","Databases","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Poisson equation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face recognition","guidance-based constraint deformation","shape distortion","facial expression","face model","Poisson equation","FRGC v2.0"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition in the Presence of Expression: A Guidance-based Constraint Deformation Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270302/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738177","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition in the Presence of Expression: A Guidance-based Constraint Deformation Approach","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072983S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270304,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zhong","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37647212500"},{"name":"Zhenan Sun","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37280349600"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274123300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270304","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Face recognition","Spatial databases","Data mining","Gabor filters","Principal component analysis","Neural networks","Flowcharts","Tensile stress","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","Gabor filters","image classification","image texture","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust 3D face recognition","learned visual codebook","intrinsic discriminative information extraction","Gabor filters","K-means clustering","nearest neighbor classifier","Gabor features","texture classification","3D face database"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel learned visual code-book (LVC) for 3D face recognition.

We construct LVC by these learned centers. Finally we represent 3D faces based on LVC and achieve recognition using a nearest neighbor (NN) classifier. The novelty of this paper comes from 1) We first apply textons based methods into 3D face recognition; 2) We encompass the efficiency of Gabor features for face recognition and the robustness of texton strategy for texture classification simultaneously.

Experimental results show LVC performs better than many commonly used methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383279","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust 3D Face Recognition Using Learned Visual Codebook","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust 3D Face Recognition Using Learned Visual Codebook","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270304/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738179","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust 3D Face Recognition Using Learned Visual Codebook","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112538S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270305,"authors":[{"name":"Vineeth Nallure Balasubramanian","affiliation":["Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Vineeth Nallure","lastName":"Balasubramanian","id":"37409169100"},{"name":"Jieping Ye","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jieping","lastName":"Ye","id":"37269201300"},{"name":"Sethuraman Panchanathan","affiliation":["Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Sethuraman","lastName":"Panchanathan","id":"37273597000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270305","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":746},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Head","Embedded computing","Face recognition","Computer interfaces","Human computer interaction","Application software","Training data","Laplace equations","Neural networks","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition","feature extraction","Laplace equations","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biased manifold embedding","person-independent head pose estimation","face images","face recognition systems","high-dimensional feature space","manifold learning techniques","pose label information","manifold-based nonlinear dimensionality","locally linear embedding","Laplacian eigen-maps techniques","generalized regression neural network","linear multivariate regression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270305","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270305.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biased Manifold Embedding: A Framework for Person-Independent Head Pose Estimation","abstract":"The estimation of head pose angle from face images is an integral component of face recognition systems, human computer interfaces and other human-centered computing applications. To determine the head pose, face images with varying pose angles can be considered to be lying on a smooth low-dimensional manifold in high-dimensional feature space. While manifold learning techniques capture the geometrical relationship between data points in the high-dimensional image feature space, the pose label information of the training data samples are neglected in the computation of these embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised approach to manifold-based non-linear dimensionality reduction for head pose estimation. The Biased Manifold Embedding (BME) framework is pivoted on the ideology of using the pose angle information of the face images to compute a biased neighborhood of each point in the feature space, before determining the low-dimensional embedding. The proposed BME approach is formulated as an extensible framework, and validated with the Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Laplacian Eigen-maps techniques. A Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is used to learn the non-linear mapping, and linear multi-variate regression is finally applied on the low-dimensional space to obtain the pose angle. We tested this approach on face images of 24 individuals with pose angles varying from -90deg to +90deg with a granularity of 2. The results showed substantial reduction in the error of pose angle estimation, and robustness to variations in feature spaces, dimensionality of embedding and other parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270305/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738180","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Biased Manifold Embedding: A Framework for Person-Independent Head Pose Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biased Manifold Embedding: A Framework for Person-Independent Head Pose Estimation","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071574S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270316,"authors":[{"name":"Thibaut Weise","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thibaut","lastName":"Weise","id":"37408566500"},{"name":"Bastian Leibe","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bastian","lastName":"Leibe","id":"37298473000"},{"name":"Luc Van Gool","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van Gool","id":"37277167600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270316","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":148,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":1685},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Image reconstruction","Layout","Cameras","Surface reconstruction","Robustness","Real time systems","Surface texture","Stereo vision","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image scanners","lighting","motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic motion compensation","3D scanning system","active illumination","stereo illumination","scene reconstruction","phase discontinuity problem","pixel level"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel 3D scanning system combining stereo and active illumination based on phase-shift for robust and accurate scene reconstruction.

Most recent approaches focus on a single and general model for object class detection. However, in particular in the context of image sequences, it may be advantageous to adapt the general model to a more object-instance specific model in order to detect this particular object reliably within the image sequence. In this work we present a generative object model that is capable to scale from a general object class model to a more specific object-instance model. This allows to detect class instances as well as to distinguish between individual object instances reliably.

Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we present a Bayesian approach which unifies the inference processes involved in object classification and localization, action understanding and perception of object reaction. Traditional approaches for object classification and action understanding have relied on shape features and movement analysis respectively. By placing object classification and localization in a video interpretation framework, we can localize and classify objects which are either hard to localize due to clutter or hard to recognize due to lack of discriminative features. Similarly, by applying context on human movements from the objects on which these movements impinge and the effects of these movements, we can segment and recognize actions which are either too subtle to perceive or too hard to recognize using motion features alone.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383331","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270329.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Object recognition","Shape","Psychology","Spraying","Videos","Bayesian methods","Neurons","Robustness","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","gesture recognition","image classification","image motion analysis","image segmentation","object recognition","video signal processing","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action understanding","object perception","human-object interactions","human movements","object recognition","human perception","Bayesian approach","inference process","object classification","object localization","video interpretation framework","action segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Objects in Action: An Approach for Combining Action Understanding and Object Perception","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270329/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270329/","accessionNumber":"9738204","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Objects in Action: An Approach for Combining Action Understanding and Object Perception","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057673S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270330,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Fai Wong","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Shu-Fai","lastName":"Wong","id":"37419503200"},{"name":"Tae-Kyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Tae-Kyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280613000"},{"name":"Roberto Cipolla","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Cipolla","id":"37298556800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270330","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion analysis","Videos","Information analysis","Image motion analysis","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Solid modeling","Motion detection","Humans","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structural information","semantic information","motion category recognition","structural dependencies","probabilistic latent semantic analysis","motion location","motion detection","human actions","facial expressions","hand gestures"]}],"abstract":"Current approaches to motion category recognition typically focus on either full spatiotemporal volume analysis (holistic approach) or analysis of the content of spatiotemporal interest points (part-based approach).

This paper presents a novel generative model, which extends probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), to capture both semantic (content of parts) and structural (connection between parts) information for motion category recognition. The structural information learnt can also be used to infer the location of motion for the purpose of motion detection.

These body models stand in sharp contrast to the richly detailed 3D body models used by the graphics community. Here we propose a method for recovering such models directly from images. Specifically, we represent the body using a recently proposed triangulated mesh model called SCAPE which employs a low-dimensional, but detailed, parametric model of shape and pose-dependent deformations that is learned from a database of range scans of human bodies. Previous work showed that the parameters of the SCAPE model could be estimated from marker-based motion capture data. Here we go further to estimate the parameters directly from image data. We define a cost function between image observations and a hypothesized mesh and formulate the problem as optimization over the body shape and pose parameters using stochastic search. Our results show that such rich generative models enable the automatic recovery of detailed human shape and pose from images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383340","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270338.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detailed Human Shape and Pose from Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270338/","displayDocTitle":"Detailed Human Shape and Pose from Images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738213","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270338/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detailed Human Shape and Pose from Images","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080401S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4270343,"authors":[{"name":"Adam O'Donovan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"O'Donovan","id":"37945032900"},{"name":"Ramani Duraiswami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Ramani","lastName":"Duraiswami","id":"37274487700"},{"name":"Jan Neumann","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Neumann","id":"37064283200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270343","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":495},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphone arrays","Cameras","Sensor arrays","Layout","Geometry","Biosensors","Acoustic sensors","Biological systems","Audio recording","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","audio-visual systems","cameras","computer vision","geometry","microphone arrays","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphone arrays","generalized cameras","integrated audio visual processing","geometrical information","source location","sound sources","scene geometry","audio-visual information fusion","geometry sensors","computer-vision inspired algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Combinations of microphones and cameras allow the joint audio visual sensing of a scene. Such arrangements of sensors are common in biological organisms and in applications such as meeting recording and surveillance where both modalities are necessary to provide scene understanding. Microphone arrays provide geometrical information on the source location, and allow the sound sources in the scene to be separated and the noise suppressed, while cameras allow the scene geometry and the location and motion of people and other objects to be estimated. In most previous work the fusion of the audio-visual information occurs at a relatively late stage. In contrast, we take the viewpoint that both cameras and microphone arrays are geometry sensors, and treat the microphone arrays as generalized cameras. We employ computer-vision inspired algorithms to treat the combined system of arrays and cameras. In particular, we consider the geometry introduced by a general microphone array and spherical microphone arrays. The latter show a geometry that is very close to central projection cameras, and we show how standard vision based calibration algorithms can be profitably applied to them. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the usefulness of the considered approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270343.pdf","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microphone Arrays as Generalized Cameras for Integrated Audio Visual Processing","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383345","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Microphone Arrays as Generalized Cameras for Integrated Audio Visual Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270343/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9738218","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270343/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microphone Arrays as Generalized Cameras for Integrated Audio Visual Processing","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085096S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4270353,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Cech","affiliation":["Center for Machine Perception, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Cech","id":"37950569000"},{"name":"Radim Sara","affiliation":["Center for Machine Perception, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Radim","lastName":"Sara","id":"37371718400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270353","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Layout","Statistics","Pixel","Pattern matching","Surface reconstruction","Image reconstruction","Pipelines","Image segmentation","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","optimisation","sampling methods","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo matching algorithm","semidense disparity map","optimization task","megapixel image"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270353","abstract":"A simple stereo matching algorithm is proposed that visits only a small fraction of disparity space in order to find a semi-dense disparity map. It works by growing from a small set of correspondence seeds. Unlike in known seed-growing algorithms, it guarantees matching accuracy and correctness, even in the presence of repetitive patterns. This success is based on the fact it solves a global optimization task. The algorithm can recover from wrong initial seeds to the extent they can even be random. The quality of correspondence seeds influences computing time, not the quality of the final disparity map. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves similar results as an exhaustive disparity space search but it is two orders of magnitude faster. This is very unlike the existing growing algorithms which are fast but erroneous. Accurate matching on 2-megapixel images of complex scenes is routinely obtained in a few seconds on a common PC from a small number of seeds, without limiting the disparity search range.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383355","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270353.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Sampling of Disparity Space for Fast And Accurate Matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Sampling of Disparity Space for Fast And Accurate Matching","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270353/","accessionNumber":"9738264","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270353/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Sampling of Disparity Space for Fast And Accurate Matching","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071374S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270369,"authors":[{"name":"Fabien Scalzo","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Nevada, Reno, USA"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Scalzo","id":"37550582800"},{"name":"Justus H.

A key component is a novel, adaptive patch feature whose width and height are automatically determined. The optimality criterion is based on minimum-variance analysis, which first computes the variance of the appearance model for various patch deformations, and then selects the patch dimensions that yield the minimum variance over the training data. They are integrated into each level of our hierarchical representation that is learned in an iterative, bottom-up fashion. At each level of the hierarchy, pairs of features are identified that tend to occur at stable positions relative to each other, by clustering the configurational distributions of observed feature co-occurrences using expectation-maximization. For recognition, evidence is propagated using nonparametric belief propagation. Discriminative models are learned on the basis of our feature hierarchy by combining a SVM classifier with feature selection based on the Fisher score. Experiments on two very different, challenging image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework for object class recognition, as well as the contribution of the adaptive patch features towards attaining highly competitive results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270369/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738260","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Patch Features for Object Class Recognition with Learned Hierarchical Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Patch Features for Object Class Recognition with Learned Hierarchical Models","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095559S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4270375,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37935237000"},{"name":"Yunhong Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281428400"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270375","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Streaming media","Computational complexity","Clustering algorithms","Training data","Laboratories","Pattern recognition","Automation","Computer science","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition","image classification","matrix algebra","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online appearance model learning","video-based face recognition","video stream","linear eigenspace models","transition matrix","face appearance manifolds","eigenspace splitting"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel online learning method which can learn appearance models incrementally from a given video stream.

We only need to maintain a few linear eigenspace models and a transition matrix to approximately construct face appearance manifolds. It is convenient to use these learnt models for video-based face recognition. There are mainly two contributions in this paper. First, we propose an algorithm which can learn appearance models online without using a pre-trained model. Second, we propose a method for eigenspace splitting to prevent that most samples cluster into the same eigenspace. This is useful for clustering and classification.

In this task, there are two problems caused by motion, which are occlusions, and changes in facial pose and illumination. Multiple cameras are used to acquire near-frontal faces to avoid occlusions and profile faces. The hierarchical image-set matching (HISM) creates a distribution for each individual by integrating a set of face images of the same individual acquired from the multiple cameras. By adopting a method for comparing between test and training distributions in identification, variation in pose and illumination is alleviated, and good recognition accuracy can be obtained. Experimental results using video sequences containing 349 people show that the proposed method achieves high recognition performance compared with conventional methods, which use frame-by-frame identification and a distribution obtained from a single camera.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383396","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270394.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Image recognition","Cameras","Face detection","Testing","Lighting","Security","Video sequences","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","face recognition","image matching","image motion analysis","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","hierarchical image-set matching","moving people cluster"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing Faces of Moving People by Hierarchical Image-Set Matching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270394/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270394/","accessionNumber":"9738321","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing Faces of Moving People by Hierarchical Image-Set Matching","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066881S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4270398,"authors":[{"name":"Fatih Kahraman","affiliation":["Informatics Institute, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Kahraman","id":"37299529000"},{"name":"Binnur Kurt","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Binnur","lastName":"Kurt","id":"37658489200"},{"name":"Muhittin Gokmen","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Muhittin","lastName":"Gokmen","id":"37341828000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270398","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Lighting","Face recognition","Active appearance model","Facial animation","Active shape model","Standards development","Convergence","Control systems","Indoor environments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust face alignment","pose invariant face recognition","active appearance model","illumination normalization module","point-to-point sense","point-to-curve sense"]}],"abstract":"In building a face recognition system for real-life scenarios, one usually faces the problem that is the selection of a feature-space and preprocessing methods such as alignment under varying illumination conditions and poses. In this study, we developed a robust face alignment approach based on Active Appearance Model (AAM) by inserting an illumination normalization module into the standard AAM searching procedure and inserting different poses of the same identity into the training set. The modified AAM search can now handle both illumination and pose variations in the same epoch, hence it provides better convergence in both point-to-point and point-to-curve senses. We also investigate how face recognition performance is affected by the selection of feature space as well as the proposed alignment method.

The system is implemented on an embedded DSP platform and processes a video stream in real-time. It consists of a detection and a character recognition module. The detector is based on the AdaBoost approach presented by Viola and Jones. Detected license plates are segmented into individual characters by using a region-based approach. Character classification is performed with support vector classification. In order to speed up the detection process on the embedded device, a Kalman tracker is integrated into the system. The search area of the detector is limited to locations where the next location of a license plate is predicted. Furthermore, classification results of subsequent frames are combined to improve the class accuracy. The major advantages of our system are its real-time capability and that it does not require any additional sensor input (e.g. from infrared sensors) except a video stream. We evaluate our system on a large number of vehicles and license plates using bad quality video and show that the low resolution can be partly compensated by combining classification results of subsequent frames.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383412","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270410.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time License Plate Recognition on an Embedded DSP-Platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270410/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time License Plate Recognition on an Embedded DSP-Platform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9737942","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270410/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time License Plate Recognition on an Embedded DSP-Platform","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100077S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4270415,"authors":[{"name":"Kristian Ambrosch","affiliation":["Austrian Research Centers GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Ambrosch","id":"37601468400"},{"name":"Wilfried Kubinger","affiliation":["Austrian Research Centers GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Kubinger","id":"37393547500"},{"name":"Martin Humenberger","affiliation":["Austrian Research Centers GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Humenberger","id":"37393549200"},{"name":"Andreas Steininger","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Steininger","id":"37284661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270415","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":665},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Stereo vision","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Costs","Application specific integrated circuits","Pixel","Radar","Automotive engineering","Automotive applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","SAD based stereo vision algorithm","stereo vision core algorithm","sum of absolute differences"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the hardware implementation of a stereo vision core algorithm, that runs in real-time and is targeted at automotive applications.

These extensions include (a) pairing opposite-direction gradients in the formation of orientation histograms and (b) focusing on edge structures only. We also compare the stability of MSER, Laplacian-of-Gaussian, and Harris corner keypoint location detection and the impact of detection errors on matching results. Our experiments on multimodal image pairs and on image pairs with significant intensity differences show that indexing based on our modified descriptors produces more correct matches on difficult pairs than current techniques at the cost of a small decrease in performance on easier pairs. This extends the applicability of image registration algorithms such as the Dual-Bootstrap which rely on correctly matching only a small number of keypoints.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383426","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270424.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Keypoint Descriptors for Matching Across Multiple Image Modalities and Non-linear Intensity Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270424/","displayDocTitle":"Keypoint Descriptors for Matching Across Multiple Image Modalities and Non-linear Intensity Variations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738232","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270424/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keypoint Descriptors for Matching Across Multiple Image Modalities and Non-linear Intensity Variations","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-468.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076168S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270438,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Dore","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genova, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Dore","id":"37392301600"},{"name":"Matteo Pinasco","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genova, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Pinasco","id":"37938507000"},{"name":"Carlo S.

Therefore, in recent years to cope with this issue, bio-inspired approaches has gathered the attention of several researchers. In this work a learning method is proposed based on a model derived from neurophysiological observations of the generation of the sense of self which is connected to the memorization of the interaction with external entity. The domain of application where this algorithm is employed, is a Cognitive Surveillance system which aims at detecting intruders and communicate guidance messages to a user (a guard) provided with a mobile device in order to chase him. The proposed method intends to allow the system to establish an efficient interaction with the user by sending messages only when necessary. To this end the zones of the monitored area are classified according to the probability that a change in pursuit strategy will occur by learning online the motion of the user and the intruder. The proposed algorithm has been tested on real world data demonstrating the capacity of learning this information to be used to tag the zones of the area under exam.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270438.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-inspired Learning Approach for the Classification of Risk Zones in a Smart Space","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Robot kinematics","Learning systems","Surveillance","Personal digital assistants","Target tracking","Underwater tracking","Dynamic programming","Event detection","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","risk analysis","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired learning approach","risk zones classification","smart space","human brain","interaction memorization","cognitive surveillance system","mobile device","user motion","intruder","learning capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-inspired Learning Approach for the Classification of Risk Zones in a Smart Space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270438/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738249","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-inspired Learning Approach for the Classification of Risk Zones in a Smart Space","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053845S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4270457,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Pan","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Pan","id":"37939291300"},{"name":"Shengcai Liao","affiliation":["Center for Biometrics and Security Research & National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shengcai","lastName":"Liao","id":"37287533300"},{"name":"Zhijian Zhang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhijian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37934191200"},{"name":"Stan Z.

The calibration handled in this paper is projective relation between 3D space and 2D pattern, and is not correction of trapezoid distortion in projected pattern. In projector-camera systems, especially for 3D measurement, such calibration is the basis of process. The projection from projector can be modeled as inverse projection of the pinhole camera, which is generally considered as perspective projection. In the existing systems, some special objects or devices are often used to calibrate projector, so that 3D-2D projection map can be measured for typical camera calibration methods. The proposed method utilizes projective geometry between camera and projector, so that it requires only pre-calibrated camera and a plane. It is easy to practice, easy to calculate, and reasonably accurate.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383477","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270475.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projector Calibration using Arbitrary Planes and Calibrated Camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Projector Calibration using Arbitrary Planes and Calibrated Camera","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270475/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738331","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270475/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projector Calibration using Arbitrary Planes and Calibrated Camera","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070546S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270490,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew C.

For consumer imaging applications, person recognition is an important tool that is useful for searching and retrieving images from a personal image collection. It has been shown that when recognizing a single person in an image, a maximum likelihood classifier requires the prior probability for each candidate individual. In this paper, we extend this idea and describe the benefits of using a group prior for identifying people in consumer images with multiple people. The group prior describes the probability of a group of individuals appearing together in an image. In our application, we have a subset of ambiguously labeled images for a consumer image collection, where we seek to identify all of the people in the collection. We describe a simple algorithm for resolving the ambiguous labels. We show that despite errors in resolving ambiguous labels, useful classifiers can be trained with the resolved labels. Recognition performance is further improved with a group prior learned from the ambiguous labels. In summary, by modeling the relationships between the people with the group prior, we improve classification performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270490.pdf","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Group Prior to Identify People in Consumer Images","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383492","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Using Group Prior to Identify People in Consumer Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270490/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9738286","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270490/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Group Prior to Identify People in Consumer Images","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048069S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4270495,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Yao","affiliation":["IDIAP Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yao","id":"37935108100"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Odobez","affiliation":["IDIAP Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Odobez","id":"37271897800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270495","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":178,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1731},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Lighting","Layout","Robustness","Photometry","Filters","Data mining","Recursive estimation","Statistics","Subtraction techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image motion analysis","image texture","lighting","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer background subtraction","local texture features","local binary patterns","photometric invariant color measurements","RGB color space","illumination invariance","layer-based strategy","moving background pixels modeling","quasi-periodic flickering","cross-bilateral filter","video stream"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a robust multi-layer background subtraction technique which takes advantages of local texture features represented by local binary patterns (LBP) and photometric invariant color measurements in RGB color space. LBP can work robustly with respective to light variation on rich texture regions but not so efficiently on uniform regions. In the latter case, color information should overcome LBP's limitation. Due to the illumination invariance of both the LBP feature and the selected color feature, the method is able to handle local illumination changes such as cast shadows from moving objects. Due to the use of a simple layer-based strategy, the approach can model moving background pixels with quasi-periodic flickering as well as background scenes which may vary over time due to the addition and removal of long-time stationary objects. Finally, the use of a cross-bilateral filter allows to implicitly smooth detection results over regions of similar intensity and preserve object boundaries. Numerical and qualitative experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383497","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Layer Background Subtraction Based on Color and Texture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Layer Background Subtraction Based on Color and Texture","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270495/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738336","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270495/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Layer Background Subtraction Based on Color and Texture","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086037S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270502,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Piccardi","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Sydney University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Piccardi","id":"37283401200"},{"name":"Oscar Perez","affiliation":["Computer Science Department-GIAA, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Colmenarejo, Spain"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Perez","id":"37722630800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270502","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Kernel","Gaussian processes","Videos","State estimation","Delay estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Artificial neural networks","Databases","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","image recognition","maximum likelihood estimation","statistical distributions","video databases","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","kernel density estimation","emission probabilities","activity recognition","adapted Baum-Welch algorithm","maximum-likelihood estimation","Gaussians mixture","probability distributions","CAVIAR video surveillance database"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a modified hidden Markov model with emission probabilities modelled by kernel density estimation and its use for activity recognition in videos.

Experiments on activity recognition have been performed on ground-truthed data from the CAVIAR video surveillance database and reported in the paper. The error on the training and validation sets with kernel density estimation remains around 14-16% while for the conventional Gaussian mixture approach varies between 15 and 24%, strongly depending on the initial values chosen for the parameters. Overall, kernel density estimation proves capable of providing more flexible modelling of the emission probabilities and, unlike Gaussian mixtures, does not suffer from being highly parametric and of difficult initialisation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Models with Kernel Density Estimation of Emission Probabilities and their Use in Activity Recognition","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383504","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270502.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Models with Kernel Density Estimation of Emission Probabilities and their Use in Activity Recognition","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270502/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738343","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Models with Kernel Density Estimation of Emission Probabilities and their Use in Activity Recognition","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091498S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270510,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Ke","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ke","id":"37275823100"},{"name":"Rahul Sukthankar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon","Intel Research Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Sukthankar","id":"37282878500"},{"name":"Martial Hebert","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon"],"firstName":"Martial","lastName":"Hebert","id":"37271437400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1179-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1180-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"4270510","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":659},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270510","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Cameras","Robustness","Image motion analysis","Image recognition","Humans","Computer science","Object segmentation","Object recognition","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","feature extraction","gesture recognition","image classification","image segmentation","spatiotemporal phenomena","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action recognition","spatiotemporal shape","flow-based correlation technique","video classification","video segmentation","object segmentation","feature extraction","tennis video"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383512","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporal Shape and Flow Correlation for Action Recognition","abstract":"This paper explores the use of volumetric features for action recognition.

We categorize anomalies into two classes: abnormal event, and abnormal context, and model them in the Sequential Monte Carlo framework which is extended by Markov Random Field for tracking interactive events. Firstly, we propose a novel pixel-wise event representation method to construct feature images, in which each blob corresponds to a visual event. Then we transform the original blob-level features into subspaces to model probabilistic appearance manifolds for each event-class. With the probability of an observation associated with each event-class (or state) derived from probabilistic manifolds, and state transitional probability, the prior and posterior state distributions can be estimated. We demonstrate in experiments that the approach can reliably detect such anomalies with low false alarm rates.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2007.383515","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4269955/4269956/04270513.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2007.383515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4269956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sequential Monte Carlo Approach to Anomaly Detection in Tracking Visual Events","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270513/","displayDocTitle":"A Sequential Monte Carlo Approach to Anomaly Detection in Tracking Visual Events","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9738354","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4270513/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sequential Monte Carlo Approach to Anomaly Detection in Tracking Visual Events","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"CVPR-00-557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047152S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4269955","isNumber":"4269956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4269955","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4269956","articleId":"4270513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270570,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu B.

The cGAs evolve a stochastic description of an hypothetical population processing a probability vector with update rules inspired to the typical selection and recombination operations of a GA. The cGAs well lend themselves to real-time implementations in constrained, low capacity microcontrollers, as they have reduced memory requirements and evenly distributed computational loads with respect to the standard, population- based GA. This paper considers the implementation of cGAs in the same microcontroller used to implement the cascaded control of an induction motor drive. We develop a real-valued version of a cGA that achieves final solutions of the same quality of those found by binary cGAs, with a significantly reduced computational cost. The potential of the proposed approach is assessed by means of an experimental study.

A hybrid control strategy, namely Gain Scheduling with Fuzzy Logic Control, is proposed. It consists of an Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). At each system operating point, properly-designed LQR can achieve fast damping for short-term or small disturbances on input and load currents. When system operating point changes, FLC can trace the changes and adaptively adjust the parameters for the LQR controller.

The performance of this newly devised protection technique is evaluated by simulation results as well as by experimental results. The complete protection scheme incorporating the wavelet power based detection algorithm successfully implemented in real-time using the ds1102 digital signal processor board for a laboratory 1.6 kW three-phase synchronous generator. The stator phase unbalance, single line to ground (L-G) fault, line-to-line (L-L) fault and turn-to-turn fault are investigated in order to evaluate the performance of the protection technique. In order to prove the superiority of the proposed protection technique over the conventional techniques, a comparison between the proposed and the conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based diagnosis scheme is made at different dynamic operating conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4270599/4270600/04270636.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"189","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4270600","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis and Protection of Stator Faults in Synchronous Generators Using Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Protection","Stators","Synchronous generators","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet packets","Discrete Fourier transforms","Voltage","Fault detection","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","fault diagnosis","machine protection","stators","synchronous generators","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stator faults diagnosis","stator faults protection","wavelet packet transformed coefficients","wavelet packet tree","three-phase synchronous generator","single line to ground fault","line-to-line fault","turn-to-turn fault","discrete Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital signal processor","Discrete Fourier transform","Fault diagnosis","Generator protection","On-line testing","Wavelet power","Wavelet packet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis and Protection of Stator Faults in Synchronous Generators Using Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4270636/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9882162","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis and Protection of Stator Faults in Synchronous Generators Using Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-1-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055495S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4270600","articleId":"4270636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270642,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Hee Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chan-Hee","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292668400"},{"name":"Jul-Ki Seok","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jul-Ki","lastName":"Seok","id":"37278995200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0742-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0743-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4270642","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensorless control","Clamps","Hafnium","Pulse width modulation inverters","Current measurement","Voltage control","AC motors","Magnetic switching","Permanent magnet motors","Zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulsating signal injection","axis switching sensorless control","PMSM","permanent magnet synchronous motors","minimal zero current clamping effects","pulsating HF signal","pulsating carrier-signal voltage","current phase angle","voltage distortions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270642","abstract":"This paper proposes an injection axis switching (IAS) sensorless control using a pulsating HF signal to minimize ZCC effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in a synchronous frame, the envelope of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an oscillating pattern with a maximum to zero magnitude. Taking this effect into account, multiple zero-crossings of HF currents around the zero-crossing region can be avoided by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. For this purpose, we develop an injection axis switching scheme according to the load condition. At no-load, the pulsating voltage is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under the load condition, the injection voltage is switched to the q-axis and the d-axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control permits the HF current magnitude to be zero at every zero-crossing point. The minimization result leads to an accurate position estimate during ZCC region and the proposed scheme does not require any additional test prior to start-up. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in suppressing the voltage distortions caused by ZCC effect.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383580","startPage":"220","endPage":"224","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4270599/4270600/04270642.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4270600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsating Signal Injection-Based Axis Switching Sensorless Control of PMSM for Minimal Zero Current Clamping Effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Pulsating Signal Injection-Based Axis Switching Sensorless Control of PMSM for Minimal Zero Current Clamping Effects","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4270642/","accessionNumber":"9882183","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270642/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsating Signal Injection-Based Axis Switching Sensorless Control of PMSM for Minimal Zero Current Clamping Effects","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-1-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036143S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4270600","articleId":"4270642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270644,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Fault in sensors may lead to intolerable degradation of performance and even to instability. Therefore, the high performance expected with vector control may not be achieved with fault in sensors. Several approaches related to fault tolerant motor control have already been proposed. However, most of them consider the sensors fault-free and work about faults in motors and actuators. Furthermore, the purpose of this work is not only sensor fault tolerance but also sensor fault compensation. In a standard fault tolerant approach, the fault would be detected and the sensor would be isolated. The faulted sensor may have an off-set or scaling error and could still be used if its error is compensated. In this paper, this is done with a mathematical solution based on kernel regression that can compensate the measurement error generating more accurate and reliable estimates. This technique is described and applied in motor drives. Simulated and experimental results are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383582","pdfPath":"/iel5/4270599/4270600/04270644.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"234","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4270600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor Compensation in Motor Drives using Kernel Regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sensor Compensation in Motor Drives using Kernel Regression","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9892506","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270644/","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor Compensation in Motor Drives using Kernel Regression","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-1-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042483S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4270600","articleId":"4270644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270645,"authors":[{"name":"Emre Un","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Un","id":"37597602900"},{"name":"Ahmet M.

A classification technique based on time series data mining is developed to detect broken rotor bar faults in induction motors. The proposed algorithm uses only stator phase currents as input without the need for any other signals. The stator phase currents are transformed to park's vector components and a new feature vector is constituted by using these components. The phase space of constituted feature vector is constructed according to determined time delay and embedding dimension for each motor conditions. Each motor condition is separated to two clusters by using fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The center points of these clusters are saved for test phase. A Gaussian membership function is used for that a point is the degree of belonging to a cluster. The current signals of a three phase induction motor are derived an actual experimental setup. A healthy induction motor and one, two and three broken rotor bar faults are classified under four different operation speed.

The LIFEcar project is aimed at producing the world's first hydrogen sports car, and the first YASA motors have been developed specifically for the vehicle. The stator segments have been made using powdered iron material which enables the machine to be run up to 300 Hz. The iron in the stator of the YASA motor is dramatically reduced when compared to other axial flux motors, typically by 50%, causing an overall increase in torque density of around 20%. A detailed Finite Element analysis (FEA) analysis of the YASA machine is presented and it is shown that the motor has a peak efficiency of over 95%.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2007.382753","startPage":"704","endPage":"708","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2007.382753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4270600","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4270599/4270600/04270726.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Yokeless And Segmented Armature Machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270726/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Yokeless And Segmented Armature Machine","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4270726/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9882287","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Yokeless And Segmented Armature Machine","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-1-126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052789S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"4270600","articleId":"4270726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":4270731,"authors":[{"name":"John Chiasson","affiliation":["ECE Department, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Chiasson","id":"37274372900"},{"name":"Burak Ozpineci","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Burak","lastName":"Ozpineci","id":"37274379700"},{"name":"Zhong Du","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Du","id":"37275785600"},{"name":"Leon M.

Such inverters have been the subject of research in the last several years, where the DC levels were considered to be identical in that all of them were either batteries, solar cells, etc. Similar to previous results in the literature, the work here shows how a cascade multilevel inverter can be used to obtain a voltage boost at higher speeds for a three-phase PM drive using only a single DC voltage source. The input of a standard three-leg inverter is connected to the DC source and the output of each leg is fed through an H-bridge (which is supplied by a capacitor) to form a cascade multilevel inverter. A fundamental switching scheme is used, which achieves the fundamental in the output voltage while eliminating the fifth harmonic. A new contribution in this paper is the development of explicit conditions in terms of the power factor and modulation index for which the capacitor voltage of the H-bridges can be regulated while simultaneously maintaining the aforementioned output voltage. This is then used for a PM motor drive showing the machine can attain higher speeds due to the higher output voltage of the multilevel inverter compared to using just a three-leg inverter.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2007.382758","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4270599/4270600/04270731.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4270600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2007.382758","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","startPage":"731","endPage":"735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditions for Capacitor Voltage Regulation in a Five-Level Cascade Multilevel Inverter: Application to Voltage-Boost in a PM Drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Conditions for Capacitor Voltage Regulation in a Five-Level Cascade Multilevel Inverter: Application to Voltage-Boost in a PM Drive","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270731/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4270731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9892496","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditions for Capacitor Voltage Regulation in a Five-Level Cascade Multilevel Inverter: Application to Voltage-Boost in a PM Drive","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-1-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040276S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4270600","articleId":"4270731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4270733,"authors":[{"name":"Bulent Ustuntepe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bulent","lastName":"Ustuntepe","id":"37669939300"},{"name":"Ahmet M.

The traction control system is designed to guarantee the EV dynamics and stability in case of no differential gears. Using two electrics in-wheel motors give the possibility to have a torque and speed control in each wheel. This control level improves the EV stability and the safety. The proposed traction control system uses the vehicle speed, which is different from wheels speed characterized by slip in the driving mode, an input. In this case, a generalized neural network algorithm is proposed to estimate the vehicle speed. In terms of the analysis and the simulations carried out, the conclusion can be drawn that the proposed system is feasible. Simulation results on a test vehicle propelled by two 37-kW induction motors showed that the proposed control approach operates satisfactorily.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2007.382780","pdfPath":"/iel5/4270599/4270600/04270753.pdf","startPage":"854","endPage":"859","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2007.382780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4270600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Modeling and Neural Network Traction Control of an Electric Vehicle without Differential Gears","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Modeling and Neural Network Traction Control of an Electric Vehicle without Differential Gears","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9882138","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270753/","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Modeling and Neural Network Traction Control of an Electric Vehicle without Differential Gears","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-1-153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152744S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4270600","articleId":"4270753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270768,"authors":[{"name":"Katsumi Yamazaki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsumi","lastName":"Yamazaki","id":"37288878500"},{"name":"Atsushi Abe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Abe","id":"37924237000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0742-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0743-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4270768","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Magnetic analysis","Permanent magnet motors","Eddy currents","Magnetic separation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Finite element methods","Loss measurement","Magnetic field measurement","Electromagnetic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","finite element analysis","harmonics suppression","permanent magnet motors","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent magnet motors","carrier harmonics","magnet eddy current loss estimation","3D FEM","PWM inverters","finite element analysis","electromagnetic field distribution","time-harmonic components","loss reduction","harmonics reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","iron loss","PWM inverter","carrier harmonics","finite element method"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate losses of interior permanent magnet motors driven by PWM inverters using the 3-D finite element analysis, which can estimate the eddy current loss in the permanent magnet accurately.

In this approach electromagnetic torque error, stator flux linkage error and stator flux angle are fuzzified using three appropriate fuzzy sets.

In this paper direct torque control (DTC) of a PMSM drive is simulated using both conventional table based and fuzzy methods and the PI speed controller is tuned using GA. A comparative study between conventional DTC and proposed approach shows that not only the speed response of the controller has been improved but also torque, flux and stator current ripples have significantly been reduced without any effective change of the inverter switching frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270773/","accessionNumber":"9892486","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Direct Torque Control of a PMSM using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Direct Torque Control of a PMSM using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-2-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10744S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4270762","articleId":"4270773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4270781,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Seok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-Seok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37696370600"},{"name":"Mi-Hee Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mi-Hee","lastName":"Park","id":"37932244900"},{"name":"Min-Myung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Myung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37695644900"},{"name":"Jung-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336627100"},{"name":"Jang-Sung Chun","affiliation":["TSA Company Limited, Bucheon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jang-Sung","lastName":"Chun","id":"37362788900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0742-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0743-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4270781","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"It is necessary to modify the state-of-the-art of speed control theory because of the phase asymmetry in the linear induction motor (LIM) and for the constant speed control of mover using single vector control inverter system, it is important that primary stack is located in appropriated intervals in the 3D conveyer system using LIM.

It was necessary to redesign stator core and winding, to embed the stator damper winding and implement new magnetic and insulating materials in order to reach new higher power. Redesigned stator core needs to be of the same outside dimensions as the original one, and to be placed in the old stator casing. Refurbishment requirements with remaining the original machine parameters (but higher output) such as synchronous reactance, audible noise level, voltage and frequency regulation, reactive power and temperature rise in insulation class B have been achieved. Impact of embedding the stator damper winding has been determined by finite-element analysis since the other parameters of refurbished generator have been calculated using analytical and finite element modeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4270787/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9892549","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Turbogenerator refurbishment with up-rating based on embedding stator damper winding and modern electromagnetic materials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbogenerator refurbishment with up-rating based on embedding stator damper winding and modern electromagnetic materials","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-2-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036759S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","xplore-issue":"4270762","articleId":"4270787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4270852,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The idea behind the active speed stall control concept is to make a rotor that is as simple as possible, and therefore very robust and suitable for offshore wind turbines. This is done by removing the pitch control of the blades. Above rated wind speed, the power is not controlled by controlling the pitch, but by controlling the rotor speed: the rotor speed is so much reduced that the aerodynamic power is limited to the rated value. A rough 10 MW permanent-magnet direct- drive generator design is presented, indicating that such a generator is feasible. It is shown that for a thorough evaluation of active speed stall control, more knowledge is required about changes in the wind speed. However, a considerable increase in generator system cost is necessary to enable active speed stall control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"10 MW Wind Turbine Direct-Drive Generator Design with Pitch or Active Speed Stall Control","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383632","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4270599/4270762/04270852.pdf","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2007.383632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4270762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4270852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4270852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"10 MW Wind Turbine Direct-Drive Generator Design with Pitch or Active Speed Stall Control","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4270852/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9882304","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"10 MW Wind Turbine Direct-Drive Generator Design with Pitch or Active Speed Stall Control","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"IEMDC-2-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093049S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4270599","isNumber":"4270762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4270599","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4270762","articleId":"4270852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4270861,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Faiz","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Faiz","id":"37272819800"},{"name":"B.

The efficiency of induction motor at low load operation and at rated flux is very low compared when operating at full load due to excessively increase in iron losses. To improve this efficiency, it is essential to obtain the flux level that minimizes the total motor losses. In this paper, the proposed controller is designed to generate both the voltage and frequency reference signals simultaneously. The proposed controller was simulated for variable speed compressor application. The results obtained clearly show that the efficiency at low speed is significantly increased. Besides that the speed of the motor can be maintained.

The performances achievable by classical linear controllers, e.g. PD, are usually limited due to highly nonlinear behavior of the hydraulic dynamics. It is shown that the fuzzy neural controller, which is employed in this paper, can be successfully used to stabilize any chosen operating point of the system.

Our results show that the GNN was slightly more accurate than c4.5 on both datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271031/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9809650","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271031/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Granular Neural Network Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Granular Neural Network Architecture","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NAFIPS-00-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099519S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271016","isNumber":"4271017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271016","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4271017","articleId":"4271031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4271036,"authors":[{"name":"Lourdes Pelayo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Lourdes","lastName":"Pelayo","id":"37939431900"},{"name":"Scott Dick","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Dick","id":"37284391200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1213-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1214-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4271036","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":536},"abstract":"Due to the tremendous complexity and sophistication of software, improving software reliability is an enormously difficult task. We study the software defect prediction problem, which focuses on predicting which modules will experience a failure during operation. Numerous studies have applied machine learning to software defect prediction; however, skewness in defect-prediction datasets usually undermines the learning algorithms. The resulting classifiers will often never predict the faulty minority class. This problem is well known in machine learning and is often referred to as learning from unbalanced datasets. We examine stratification, a widely used technique for learning unbalanced data that has received little attention in software defect prediction. Our experiments are focused on the SMOTE technique, which is a method of over-sampling minority-class examples. Our goal is to determine if SMOTE can improve recognition of defect-prone modules, and at what cost. Our experiments demonstrate that after SMOTE resampling, we have a more balanced classification. We found an improvement of at least 23% in the average geometric mean classification accuracy on four benchmark datasets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Costs","Testing","Software reliability","Machine learning algorithms","Software algorithms","Computer errors","Joining processes","Nearest neighbor searches","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","sampling methods","software metrics","software performance evaluation","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resampling strategy","software defect prediction","software complexity","software sophistication","software reliability","machine learning","learning algorithms","unbalanced datasets","SMOTE technique","over-sampling minority-class examples","defect-prone modules","geometric mean classification accuracy","benchmark datasets"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.2007.383813","publicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2007 - 2007 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","displayPublicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2007 - 2007 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271016/4271017/04271036.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAFIPS.2007.383813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Novel Resampling Strategies To Software Defect Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Applying Novel Resampling Strategies To Software Defect Prediction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271036/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271036/","accessionNumber":"9833482","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Novel Resampling Strategies To Software Defect Prediction","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NAFIPS-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046996S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271016","isNumber":"4271017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271016","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4271017","articleId":"4271036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4271057,"authors":[{"name":"Dongrui Wu","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dongrui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37693329600"},{"name":"Jerry M.

Fuzzy modeling or fuzzy model identification is an arduous task, demanding the identification of many parameters that can be viewed as an optimization process. Evolutionary algorithms are well suited to the problem of fuzzy modeling because they are able to search complex and high dimensional search space while being able to avoid local minima (or maxima). The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, like other evolutionary algorithms, is a stochastic technique based on the metaphor of social interaction. PSO is similar to the genetic algorithm (GA) as these two evolutionary heuristics are population-based search methods. The main objective of this paper is to present the tremendous savings in computational efforts that can be achieved through the use of PSO algorithm in comparison to GA, when used for the identification of fuzzy models from the available input-output data. For realistic comparison, the training data, models complexity and some other common parameters that influence the computational efforts considerably are not changed. The real data from the rapid nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery charger developed has been used for the purpose of illustration and simulation purposes.","doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.2007.383845","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","displayPublicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2007 - 2007 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271016/4271017/04271068.pdf","publicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2007 - 2007 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAFIPS.2007.383845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Computational Efforts between Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm for Identification of Fuzzy Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Fuzzy systems","Knowledge based systems","Humans","Stochastic processes","Search methods","Training data","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy reasoning","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm","fuzzy model identification","fuzzy systems","rule-based systems","information representation","information processing","reasoning","evolutionary algorithm","search space","stochastic technique","social interaction","population-based search method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Computational Efforts between Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm for Identification of Fuzzy Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9809671","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Computational Efforts between Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm for Identification of Fuzzy Models","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NAFIPS-00-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060652S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271016","isNumber":"4271017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271016","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4271017","articleId":"4271068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4271135,"authors":[{"name":"Olivia Mendoza","affiliation":["Department of Research and Graduate Studies, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Mendoza","id":"37688321700"},{"name":"Guillermo Licea","affiliation":["Department of Research and Graduate Studies, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Licea","id":"37620714400"},{"name":"Patricia Melin","affiliation":["Department of Research and Graduate Studies, Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Melin","id":"37271192400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1213-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1214-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4271135","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Face recognition","Image edge detection","Fuzzy systems","Convolution","Fuzzy neural networks","Image recognition","Detectors","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","face recognition","fuzzy logic","inference mechanisms","integral equations","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular neural networks","fuzzy logic","face recognition","type-2 fuzzy inference systems","edge detection","Sugeno integral"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271135","abstract":"In this paper we present a method for face recognition combining modular neural networks and two interval type-2 fuzzy inference systems (FIS 2) for face recognition.

To examine the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiac and thoracic surgery a retrospective study was performed on 1674 selected patients admitted in the Cardiothoracic ICU of the University Hospital of Vienna. SIRS was defined according to the American College of Chest Physicians / Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP / SCCM) Consensus Conference. The term's SIRS, sepsis, septic shock and MODS (multi organ dysfunction syndrome) are used to describe the different extents of inflammation and infections. In the first phase the moment of the first occurrence of SIRS, and of severe SIRS was determined. An SIRS episode was defined as a time interval from the beginning of SIRS until the receding of the symptoms for more than 24 hours. Based on this information, an artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to predict severe SIRS. SIRS was present in 1544 patients (92.2%), SIRS with additional signs of organ dysfunction evolving in 76.1% of the cases; the progression took less than 24 hours in 87.9% of the cases. The presence of signs of the SIRS on the first operative day is hardly suitable for the risk prediction. A significant correlation between the number of SIRS episodes and the outcome for each individual patient was found. The number of SIRS episodes could be an accurate parameter for estimating the outcome and the treatment outlay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271140/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9846945","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271140/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sepsis and Septic Shock Analysis using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sepsis and Septic Shock Analysis using Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NAFIPS-00-123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050206S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271016","isNumber":"4271017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271016","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4271017","articleId":"4271140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4271169,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Such algorithms map nicely on high-performance systems such as massively parallel clusters and networks of computers. Unfortunately, these systems are generally expensive and difficult to adapt to onboard data processing scenarios, in which low-weight and low-power integrated components are highly desirable to reduce mission payload. An exciting new development in this context is the emergence of graphics processing units (GPUs), which can now satisfy extremely high computational requirements at low cost. In this letter, we propose a GPU-based implementation of the automated morphological end member extraction algorithm, which is used in this letter as a representative case study of joint spatial/spectral techniques for hyperspectral image processing. The proposed implementation is quantitatively assessed in terms of both end member extraction accuracy and parallel efficiency, using two generations of commercial GPUs from NVidia. Combined, these parts offer a thoughtful perspective on the potential and emerging challenges of implementing hyperspectral imaging algorithms on commodity graphics hardware.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Morphological Endmember Extraction Using Commodity Graphics Hardware","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2007.897398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4271437/04271467.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2007.897398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Morphological Endmember Extraction Using Commodity Graphics Hardware","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4271467/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9960719","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Morphological Endmember Extraction Using Commodity Graphics Hardware","sourcePdf":"04lgrs03-setoain.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056707S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4271437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4271437","articleId":"4271467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4271471,"authors":[{"name":"Guangjian Yan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangjian","lastName":"Yan","id":"37273010100"},{"name":"Chaoyang Li","affiliation":["Laboratory of Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chaoyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37933071300"},{"name":"Guoqing Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering and Technology, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37333592300"},{"name":"Wuming Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wuming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291408700"},{"name":"Xiaowen Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Li","id":"37280864300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4271471","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1268},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Detectors","Image resolution","Monitoring","Image analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Digital cameras","Helicopters","Performance evaluation","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","feature extraction","geophysical techniques","Kalman filters","monitoring","photogrammetry","power cables","Radon transforms","remote sensing","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic power line extraction","aerial images","aerial photogrammetric technology","sensor technology","power line status monitoring","aerial digital camera","helicopter","Radon transform","line segment extraction","grouping method","Kalman filter","line mask detector method","ratio line detector","background complexity","China National 863 project","power line surveillance","3D reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial image","feature extraction","image processing","power line monitoring","power lines"]}],"abstract":"There has been little investigation for the automatic extraction of power lines from aerial images due to the low resolution of aerial images in the past decades. With increasing aerial photogrammetric technology and sensor technology, it is possible for photogrammetrists to monitor the status of power lines. This letter analyzes the property of imaged power lines and presents an algorithm to automatically extract the power line from aerial images acquired by an aerial digital camera onboard a helicopter. This algorithm first uses a Radon transform to extract line segments of the power line, then uses the grouping method to link each segment, and finally applies the Kalman filter technology to connect the segments into an entire line. We compared our algorithm with the line mask detector method and the ratio line detector, and evaluated their performances. The experimental results demonstrated that our algorithm can successfully extract the power lines from aerial images regardless of background complexity. This presented method has successfully been applied in China National 863 project for power line surveillance, 3-D reconstruction, and modeling.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2007.895714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4271437/04271471.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2007.895714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Extraction of Power Lines From Aerial Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271471/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Extraction of Power Lines From Aerial Images","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9960723","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271471/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Extraction of Power Lines From Aerial Images","sourcePdf":"04lgrs03-yan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060147S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4271437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4271437","articleId":"4271471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4271473,"authors":[{"name":"Brice Yver","affiliation":["Laboratory of Remote Sensing, Environment, Commissariat \u00e0 l''Energie Atomique, Bruyeres le Chatel, France"],"firstName":"Brice","lastName":"Yver","id":"37062411500"},{"name":"Rodolphe Marion","affiliation":["Laboratory of Remote Sensing, Environment, Commissariat \u00e0 l''Energie Atomique, Bruyeres le Chatel, France"],"firstName":"Rodolphe","lastName":"Marion","id":"37829713500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4271473","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral sensors","Hyperspectral imaging","Matched filters","Pixel","Detectors","Covariance matrix","Infrared spectra","Bayesian methods","Object detection","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","geophysical signal processing","Markov processes","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral anomaly detection","spectral a priori information","spatial a priori information","matched filters","detection distance","Bayesian approach","Markovian regularization","HyMap hyperspectral image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["A priori knowledge","anomaly detection","hyperspectral imagery","maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation","spatial regularization","spectral distance"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a new theoretical approach for anomaly detection using a priori information about targets. This a priori knowledge deals with the general spectral behavior and the spatial distribution of targets. In this letter, we consider subpixel and isolated targets that are spectrally anomalous in one region of the spectrum but not in another. This method is totally different from matched filters that suffer from a relative sensitivity to low errors in the target spectral signature. We incorporate the spectral a priori knowledge in a new detection distance, and we propose a Bayesian approach with a Markovian regularization to suppress the potential targets that do not respect the spatial a priori.

Though most X-ray inspections for high-quality imaging require ionizing dose amounts that are considered inconsequential for device failure or non-functionality, the degree of latent damage must be carefully considered. This paper discusses X-ray-induced vulnerabilities of high-density dynamic random access memory exposed to low ionizing radiation levels typical in X-ray inspection systems. We look at critical parameters and their sensitivity in relation to varying dose amounts of X-ray irradiation. In consideration of different methodologies of reducing radiation dose amounts and limiting device exposure, we propose a procedure for attenuating potentially harmful X-ray radiation levels while preserving quality images.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2007.891530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/4271478/04271488.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2007.891530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X-Ray Radiation Effect in DRAM Retention Time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"X-Ray Radiation Effect in DRAM Retention Time","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271488/","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9609750","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271488/","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-Ray Radiation Effect in DRAM Retention Time","sourcePdf":"07tdmr01-ditali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049448S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"4271478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4271478","articleId":"4271488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4271508,"authors":[{"name":"Hans Reisinger","affiliation":["Central Reliability Methodology Group, Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4271478/4271508/4271508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hans Reisinger received the diploma and the Ph.D. degree in physics from the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany, in 1979 and 1983, respectively.","He joined the Semiconductor Department, Siemens (now Infineon Technologies), Munich, in 1986, focusing mostly on the study of thin dielectrics and interfaces in DRAMs and NVMs. He is currently with the Central Reliability Methodology Group, Infineon Technologies, working on MOSFET degradation."]},"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Reisinger","id":"37275398500"},{"name":"Oliver Blank","affiliation":["Technology Integration Group, Infineon Technologies, Regensburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4271478/4271508/4271508-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Oliver Blank received the diploma in physics from the University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in engineering science in 2006, with a dissertation on the modeling of leakage currents in high- k dielectrics.","He joined Infineon Technologies, Regensburg, Germany, in 2002, where he is currently with the Technology Integration Group, working on the development of DMOS power FETs."]},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Blank","id":"37313464900"},{"name":"Wolfgang Heinrigs","affiliation":["Central Reliability Methodology Group, Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4271478/4271508/4271508-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Wolfgang Heinrigs received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule (RTWH) Aachen, Aachen, Germany, in 1977 and 1982, respectively.","He joined the Semiconductor Department of Siemens (now Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany) in 1985, where he worked in the Technology Development and later in the Device Group of the Reliability Department and where he is currently with the Reliability Methodology Group."]},"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Heinrigs","id":"37699253300"},{"name":"Wolfgang Gustin","affiliation":["Central Reliability Methodology Group, Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4271478/4271508/4271508-photo-4-source-small.gif","p":["Wolfgang Gustin received the diploma in physics from the University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany, in 1990 and the Ph.D. degree in physics from the Max-Planck-Institut, Stuttgart, in 1994.","From 1994 to 1998, he was with Philips and IBM, working on integration and unit process issues for logic and DRAM technologies.

Unlike the watermark algorithms based on the traditional two-band wavelet transform, where the watermark bits are embedded directly on the wavelet coefficients, in the proposed scheme, we embed the watermark bits in the mean trend of some middle-frequency subimages in the wavelet domain. We further select appropriate dilation factor and filters in the multiband wavelet transform to achieve better performance in terms of perceptually invisibility and the robustness of the watermark. The experimental results show that the proposed blind watermarking scheme is robust against JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, median filtering, and Con-vFilter attacks. The comparison analysis demonstrate that our scheme has better performance than the watermarking schemes reported recently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9605867","htmlLink":"/document/4271513/","pubMedId":"17688201","displayDocTitle":"Robust Image Watermarking Based on Multiband Wavelets and Empirical Mode Decomposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Image Watermarking Based on Multiband Wavelets and Empirical Mode Decomposition","sourcePdf":"16tip08-bi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129626S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4271512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4271512","articleId":"4271513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4271520,"authors":[{"name":"Kostadin Dabov","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4271512/4271520/4271520-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kostadin Dabov (S'07) received the M.Sc. degree in digital signal processing from the Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, in April 2006, where he is currently pursuing the D.Tech. degree in signal restoration with locally adaptive transform-based techniques.","His interests include signal enhancement and restoration and efficient design and realization of signal processing algorithms."]},"firstName":"Kostadin","lastName":"Dabov","id":"37939658200"},{"name":"Alessandro Foi","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4271512/4271520/4271520-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Foi received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the Politecnico di Milano in 2005.","His research interests include mathematical and statistical methods for signal processing, functional analysis, and harmonic analysis.

The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3D data arrays which we call \"groups.\" Collaborative Altering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3D transformation. The result is a 3D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.901238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.901238","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4271512/04271520.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Denoising by Sparse 3-D Transform-Domain Collaborative Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Denoising by Sparse 3-D Transform-Domain Collaborative Filtering","volume":"16","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607586","pubMedId":"17688213","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4271520/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Denoising by Sparse 3-D Transform-Domain Collaborative Filtering","sourcePdf":"16tip08-dabov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107998S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4271512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"4188","xplore-issue":"4271512","articleId":"4271520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4271531,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin A.

Often, however, for such systems, traditional delayed-decision algorithms can become computationally prohibitive due to the growth in the size of the space of possible solutions. In this paper, we propose a reduced-complexity, one-pass, delayed-decision algorithm that systematically reduces the size of the search space, while also preserving its structure. In particular, we apply the proposed algorithm to two examples of adaptive context-based image processing systems, an image coding system that employs a context-based entropy coder, and a spatially adaptive image-denoising system. For these two types of widely used systems, we show that the proposed delayed-decision search algorithm outperforms instantaneous-decision algorithms with only a small increase in complexity. We also show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of other, higher complexity, delayed-decision algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4271542/","accessionNumber":"9605872","pubMedId":"17688199","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Delayed-Decision Algorithm for Context-Based Image Processing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Delayed-Decision Algorithm for Context-Based Image Processing Systems","sourcePdf":"16tip08-singh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106671S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4271512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4271512","articleId":"4271542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4271551,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Wei Fang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4271545/4271551/4271551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jia-Wei Fang (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2005.

The DA-based PID controller demonstrates 80% savings in hardware utilization and 40% savings in power consumption compared to the multiplier-based scheme. It also offers good closed-loop performance while using less resources, resulting in cost reduction, high speed, and low power consumption, which is desirable in embedded control applications. The complete digital control system is built using commercial FPGAs to demonstrate the efficiency. The design uses a modular approach, so that some modules can be reused in other applications. These reusable modules can be ported into Matlab/Simulink as Simulink blocks for hardware/software cosimulation or integrated into a larger design in the Matlab/Simulink environment to allow for rapid prototyping applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.898283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.898283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04271566.pdf","startPage":"1898","endPage":"1906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271566/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Modular FPGA-Based PID Controllers","volume":"54","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9606388","htmlLink":"/document/4271566/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Modular FPGA-Based PID Controllers","sourcePdf":"54tie04-chan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155582S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4271566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4271567,"authors":[{"name":"Yves-Andre Chapuis","affiliation":["InESS/ULP-CNRS (UMR 7163), Strasbourg, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4271567/4271567-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yves-Andre Chapuis received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, Toulouse, France, in 1990, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, in 1995.","From 1990 to 1992, he was a college teacher for the French education ministry.

Hybrid control is a general approach for control of a switching-based hybrid system (HS). This class of HS includes a continuous process controlled by a discrete controller with a finite number of states. In the case of ac motor drives, in contrast to conventional vector control like proportional-integral control or predictive control, where the inverter is not taken into account by the controller, hybrid control integrates the inverter model and considers the state of the inverter as a control variable. It allows to obtain faster torque dynamics than vector-control algorithms. The hybrid control algorithm requires both computing velocity for real-time implementation and code flexibility for management of low-performance functions and analog-digital interfaces. Codesign appears as a promising methodology for partitioning hybrid-control algorithm between software (flexible) and hardware (velocity) while taking care of overall time constrains. In this paper, the implementation of hybrid-control algorithm for a PMSM drive is performed through a codesign approach on an Excalibur board, embedding a CPU-core (Nios-2 by Altera) inside an APEX20KE200EFC484-2X field-programmable gate array. The partitioning of software and hardware parts is explained. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the implementation.

To this purpose, a variety of current control techniques, which is applied to alternating current machine drives, is designed and implemented. They consist of on-off current controllers, proportional-integral current controller, and predictive current controller. The quality of the regulated current is significantly improved. It is mainly due to a very important reduction of the execution time delay. Indeed, in all described techniques, the execution time of the designed hardware architectures is only a few microseconds. This time reduction derives directly from the possibility offered by FPGAs to design very powerful dedicated architectures. Numerous experimental results are given in order to illustrate the efficiency of FPGA-based solutions to achieve high-performance control of electrical systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.898302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04271569.pdf","startPage":"1907","endPage":"1925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.898302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Current Controllers for AC Machine Drives\u2014A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Current Controllers for AC Machine Drives\u2014A Review","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271569/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9618657","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Current Controllers for AC Machine Drives\u2014A Review","sourcePdf":"54tie04-naouar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115615S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4271569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4271570,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Sanchez-Solano","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nicade Sevilla, Centro Nacional de Microelectr\u00f3nica (CNM CSIC), Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4271570/4271570-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Santiago S\u00e1nchez-Solano received the Licenciado en F\u00edsicas degree (with honors) and the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, in 1980 and 1990, respectively.","After six years as a System Analyst at the Computer Center, University of Seville, he joined the Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla, Centro Nacional de Microelectr\u00f3nica, CNM-CSIC, Seville, where he is currently a Senior Researcher.

However, the lack of specific design tools and systematic approaches for hardware implementation of complex fuzzy controllers limits the applicability of these techniques in modern microelectronics products. This paper discusses a design strategy that eases the implementation of embedded fuzzy controllers as systems on programmable chips. The development of the controllers is carried out by means of a reconfigurable platform based on field-programmable gate arrays. This platform combines specific hardware to implement fuzzy inference modules with a general-purpose processor, thus allowing the realization of hybrid hardware/software solutions. As happens to the components of the processing system, the specific fuzzy elements are conceived as configurable intellectual property modules in order to accelerate the controller design cycle. The design methodology and tool chain presented in this paper have been applied to the realization of a control system for solving the navigation tasks of an autonomous vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.898292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04271570.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.898292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Embedded Fuzzy Controllers for Robotic Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271570/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Embedded Fuzzy Controllers for Robotic Applications","volume":"54","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271570/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9618659","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Embedded Fuzzy Controllers for Robotic Applications","sourcePdf":"54tie04-sanchezsolano.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109778S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4271570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4271607,"authors":[{"name":"David Root","affiliation":["Institute for Software Research School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Root","id":"38275214200"},{"name":"Mel Rosso-Llopart","affiliation":["Institute for Software Research School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mel","lastName":"Rosso-Llopart","id":"38275643000"},{"name":"Gil Taran","affiliation":["Institute for Software Research School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Taran","id":"37392259800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2893-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0175"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-570X"}],"articleNumber":"4271607","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271607","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software engineering","Industrial training","Computer industry","Footwear industry","Educational programs","Computer science","Gas insulated transmission lines","Humans","Communication industry","Recruitment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer science education","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boot camp","software projects","Master of Software Engineering","Carnegie Mellon University","software project initiation"]}],"abstract":"The use of project initiation techniques is not new to academia or industry.

Despite the large body of work on covert channels, this is the first comprehensive account of interrupt-related covert channel analysis and mitigation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271658/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9834405","publicationDate":"July 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271658/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Countermeasures against Interrupt-Related Covert Channels in an Information-Theoretic Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Countermeasures against Interrupt-Related Covert Channels in an Information-Theoretic Framework","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"28190326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092112S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271630","isNumber":"4271631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271630","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4271631","articleId":"4271658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4271673,"authors":[{"name":"Bran Selic","affiliation":["IBM, Canada"],"firstName":"Bran","lastName":"Selic","id":"37279598800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2914-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-3070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5998"}],"articleNumber":"4271673","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Model driven engineering","Object oriented modeling","Real time systems","Aerospace industry","Programming","Software standards","Standards development","Modems","Software systems","Embedded software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time systems","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven development","model-driven engineering","software development","real-time software","embedded software","software modeling languages"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271673","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2007.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2007.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271665","publicationTitle":"19th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"19th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271664/4271665/04271673.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Model-Driven Development to Model-Driven Engineering","abstract":"Summary form only given. The adoption of model-driven methods for software development is rapidly gaining momentum, stimulated greatly by the emergence of new modeling language standards and corresponding tools. The ability of models to highlight the important aspects of a system while abstracting away the irrelevant bits provides a very effective means of coping with the often overwhelming complexity of modern software systems.

Moreover, typical microprocessor caches are pipelined to keep up with the speed of the processor, and the effects of pipelining overhead need to be properly accounted for. In this paper, we present a detailed study of pipelined nanometer caches with detailed energy/power dissipation breakdowns showing where and how the power is dissipated within a nanometer cache. We explore a three-dimensional pipelined cache design space that includes cache size (16kB to 512kB), cache associativity (direct-mapped to 16-way) and process technology (90nm, 65nm, 45nm and 32nm). Among our findings, we show that cache bitline leakage is increasingly becoming the dominant cause of power dissipation in nanometer technology nodes. We show that subthreshold leakage is the main cause of static power dissipation, and that gate leakage is, surprisingly, not a significant contributor to total cache power, even for 32nm caches. We also show that accounting for cache pipelining overhead is necessary, as power dissipated by the pipeline elements is a significant part of cache power","doi":"10.1145/1165573.1165581","publicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4246619/4271789/04271802.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy/Power Breakdown of Pipelined Nanometer Caches (90nm/65nm/45nm/32nm)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271802/","displayDocTitle":"Energy/Power Breakdown of Pipelined Nanometer Caches (90nm/65nm/45nm/32nm)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9165134","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271802/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy/Power Breakdown of Pipelined Nanometer Caches (90nm/65nm/45nm/32nm)","confLoc":"Tegernsee, Germany","sourcePdf":"ISLPED-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057022S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4246619","isNumber":"4271789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4246619","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4271789","articleId":"4271802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4271806,"authors":[{"name":"Grigorios Magklis","affiliation":["Intel Barcelona Research Center, Intel Laboratories Barcelona-UPC, Spain"],"firstName":"Grigorios","lastName":"Magklis","id":"37274434600"},{"name":"Pedro Chaparro","affiliation":["Intel Barcelona Research Center, Intel Laboratories Barcelona-UPC, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Chaparro","id":"37273828900"},{"name":"Jose Gonzalez","affiliation":["Intel Barcelona Research Center, Intel Laboratories Barcelona-UPC, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"38559975800"},{"name":"Antonio Gonzalez","affiliation":["Intel Barcelona Research Center, Intel Laboratories Barcelona-UPC, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"37274399700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-462-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4271806","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic voltage scaling","Microarchitecture","Microprocessors","Voltage control","Energy efficiency","Iron","Clocks","Regulators","Logic","Out of order"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","logic design","microprocessor chips","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic voltage scaling","globally asynchronous locally synchronous designs","microprocessor energy consumption","voltage regulators","GALS microarchitecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","Design","DVS","GALS","MCD","energy efficiency","microarchitecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271806","doi":"10.1145/1165573.1165586","publicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","abstract":"In recent years, globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) designs and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) have emerged as some of the most popular approaches to address the ever increasing microprocessor energy consumption.

Our schemes achieve average improvement of 12% of the energy-delay metric, when using internal voltage regulators","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271789","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","displayPublicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4246619/4271789/04271806.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent Front-end and Back-end Dynamic Voltage Scaling for a GALS Microarchitecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4271806/","displayDocTitle":"Independent Front-end and Back-end Dynamic Voltage Scaling for a GALS Microarchitecture","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9165138","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent Front-end and Back-end Dynamic Voltage Scaling for a GALS Microarchitecture","confLoc":"Tegernsee, Germany","sourcePdf":"ISLPED-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052001S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4246619","isNumber":"4271789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4246619","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4271789","articleId":"4271806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4271808,"authors":[{"name":"Hidehiro Fujiwara","affiliation":["Department of Computer andSystems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidehiro","lastName":"Fujiwara","id":"37532906000"},{"name":"Koji Nii","affiliation":["Department of Computer andSystems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Nii","id":"37300187800"},{"name":"Junichi Miyakoshi","affiliation":["Department of Computer andSystems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Miyakoshi","id":"37284356800"},{"name":"Yuichiro Murachi","affiliation":["Department of Computer andSystems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichiro","lastName":"Murachi","id":"37294350900"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Morita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and echnology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Morita","id":"37684518500"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Department of Computer andSystems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37270375100"},{"name":"Masahiko Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Department of Computer andSystems Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37269600500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-462-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4271808","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":198},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271808","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Logic","Real time systems","Clocks","Permission","Power engineering computing","Data engineering","Power engineering and energy","Systems engineering and theory","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits","low-power electronics","microprocessor chips","SRAM chips","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power two-port SRAM","power reduction","real-time video processor","discharge power","majority logic","data-bit reordering","90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Low power SRAM","two-port SRAM","real-time image processing","majority logic","data-bit reordering"]}],"abstract":"We propose a low-power two-port SRAM suitable for real-time video processing.

The knowledge of the spatial distribution of temperature can be used to properly design a clock network that is able to compensate such thermal non-uniformities. However, re-design of the clock network is effective only if temperature distribution is stationary, i.e., does not change over time. In this work, we specifically address the problem of dynamically modifying the clock tree in such a way that it can compensate for temporal variations of temperature. This is achieved by exploiting the buffers that are inserted during the clock network generation, by transforming them into tunable delay elements. Temperature-induced delay variations are then compensated by applying the proper tuning to the tunable buffers, which is computed off-line and, stored in a tuning table inserted in the design. We propose an algorithm to minimize the number of inserted tunable buffers, as well as their tunable range (which directly relates to complexity). Results show that clock skew is kept within original bounds with minimum area and power penalty.

However, it takes a long time to solve the LP problem for time slack allocation. In this paper, we develop EdTLC-NW, a slack allocation algorithm based on min-cost network flow to reduce runtime. Compared to single Vdd FPGA with power-gating, EdTLC-LP and EdTLC-NW reduce interconnect power by 52.71% and 52.52%, respectively. EdTLC-NW achieves as good results as EdTLC-LP but runs 8times faster on average.

In this paper, we present an adaptive duty cycling algorithm that allows energy harvesting sensor nodes to autonomously adjust their duty cycle according to the energy availability in the environment. The algorithm has three objectives, namely: (a) achieving energy neutral operation, i.e., energy consumption should not be more than the energy provided by the environment; (b) maximizing the system performance based on an application utility model subject to the above energy-neutrality constraint; and (c) adapting to the dynamics of the energy source at run-time. We present a model that enables harvesting sensor nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data. We also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of the energy source.

The scheme is based on the segmented virtual grounding (SVGND) of the SRAM cells. Substantial leakage reduction is achieved by increasing the threshold voltage of the cell transistors through body effect. The write and read energy consumptions are reduced significantly by decreasing the bitline voltage swing and the number of bitlines affected in each transaction. Unlike recently reported low-power schemes, SVGND allows multiple words to be placed in each row while keeping the dynamic power low. This feature is achieved by introducing an additional operation mode to the SRAM cells. The architecture is implemented in a 130nm CMOS technology.

Static leakage current which comprises a significant fraction of total power due to large on-chip caches, is exponentially dependent on widely varying physical parameters such as gate length, gate oxide thickness, and dopant ion concentration. In large structures like on-chip caches, this may mean that one portion of a cache may consume an order of magnitude larger static power than equivalently sized regions. Under this climate, egalitarian management of physical resources is clearly untenable. In this paper, we analyze the effects of within-die and die-to-die leakage variation for on-chip caches. We then propose way prioritization, a manufacturing variation aware scheme that minimizes cache leakage energy.

Floorplanning or block-level placement offers excellent potential for thermal optimization through better heat spreading between the blocks, but these optimizations can also impact the throughput of a microarchitecture, measured in terms of the number of instructions per cycle (IPC). In nanometer technologies, global buses can have multicycle delays that depend on the positions of the blocks, and it is important for a floorplanner to be microarchitecturally-aware to be sure that thermal and IPC considerations are appropriately balanced. This paper proposes a methodology for thermally-aware microarchitecture floorplanning. The approach models the interactions between the IPC and the temperature distribution, and incorporates both factors in the floorplanning cost function. Our approach uses transient modeling and optimizes both the peak and the average temperatures, and employs a design of experiments (DOE) based strategy, which effectively captures the huge exponential search space with a small number of cycle-accurate simulations. A comparison with a technique based on previous work indicates that the proposed approach results in good reductions both in the average and the peak temperatures for a range of SPEC benchmarks","doi":"10.1145/1165573.1165644","publicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4246619/4271789/04271853.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271789","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature-Aware Floorplanning of Microarchitecture Blocks with IPC-Power Dependence Modeling and Transient Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temperature-Aware Floorplanning of Microarchitecture Blocks with IPC-Power Dependence Modeling and Transient Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271853/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9165184","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4271853/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-Aware Floorplanning of Microarchitecture Blocks with IPC-Power Dependence Modeling and Transient Analysis","confLoc":"Tegernsee, Germany","sourcePdf":"ISLPED-00-64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066194S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4246619","isNumber":"4271789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4246619","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4271789","articleId":"4271853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4271854,"authors":[{"name":"James Donald","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Donald","id":"37389408200"},{"name":"Margaret Martonosi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Margaret","lastName":"Martonosi","id":"37332404000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-462-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4271854","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Timing","Analytical models","Circuits","Performance analysis","Parallel programming","Equations","Permission","Process design","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","parallel architectures","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficiency","variation-tolerant multicore processors","timing reliability","PowerPC processor","multiprogrammed workloads","SPEC 2000 benchmarks","mean error","parallel programming","Amdahl law","SPLASH-2 benchmark suite"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance","multicore","variation","power","parallel applications"]}],"abstract":"Challenges in multicore processor design include meeting demands for performance, power, and reliability. The progression towards deep submicron process technologies entails increasing challenges of process variability resulting in timing instabilities and leakage power variation.

We validate our analytical model using Turandot to simulate an 8-core PowerPCtrade processor. We first examine a simplified case of our model on a platform running independent multiprogrammed workloads consisting of all 26 of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks. Our simple model accurately predicts the cutoff point with a mean error less than 0.5 W. Next, we extend our analysis to parallel programming by incorporating Amdahl's law in our equations.

These effects, typically ignored in the behavioral simulations of SC stages, are analyzed and modeled. Thus, accurate behavioral simulations of \u0394\u03a3 modulators or pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be performed in SIMULINK, using the proposed models for their SC building blocks (integrators or amplifiers).

These tradeoffs arise due to the interaction of numerous factors such as the characteristics of the harvesting transducers, chemistry and capacity of the batteries used (if any), power supply requirements and power management features of the embedded system, application behavior, etc. This paper surveys the various issues and tradeoffs involved in designing and operating energy harvesting embedded systems. System design techniques are described that target high conversion and storage efficiency by extracting the most energy from the environment and making it maximally available for consumption. Harvesting aware power management techniques are also described, which reconcile the very different spatio-temporal characteristics of energy availability and energy usage within a system and across a network","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271789","startPage":"369","endPage":"374","displayPublicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4246619/4271789/04271870.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Power Management of Energy Harvesting Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4271870/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Power Management of Energy Harvesting Embedded Systems","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9165195","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Power Management of Energy Harvesting Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Tegernsee, Germany","sourcePdf":"ISLPED-00-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05458S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4246619","isNumber":"4271789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4246619","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4271789","articleId":"4271870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":4271875,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsheng Ma","affiliation":["Integrated System Design Laboratory, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37276762800"},{"name":"Janet Wang","affiliation":["Digital VLSI Design Laboratory, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Janet","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280528900"},{"name":"Pablo Vozqua","affiliation":["Integrated System Design Laboratory, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Vozqua","id":"37938992800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-462-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4271875","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Power supplies","Robust control","Voltage","CMOS process","Fabrication","Switching converters","Semiconductor device modeling","Battery charge measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","load regulation","power supply circuits","robust control","SPICE","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive on-chip power supply","fast line regulation","robust design","one-cycle control","integrated adaptive output","switching converter","load regulation","fine tuning","switched-capacitor integrator","dynamic loss control","HSPICE simulations","TSMC","N-well CMOS fabrication process","battery perturbation","475 mW","0.35 micron","3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Performance","Switching converter","adaptive output","robust design","one-cycle control"]}],"doi":"10.1145/1165573.1165670","publicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"ISLPED'06 Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4246619/4271789/04271875.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive On-Chip Power Supply with Robust One-Cycle Control Technique","abstract":"In this paper, an integrated adaptive output switching converter is proposed. The design uses a one-cycle control for fast line regulation and a single outer loop for load regulation and fine tuning. A switched-capacitor integrator is introduced in the one-cycle control to obtain positive integration with a single positive power supply, allowing a standard low-cost CMOS fabrication process. To improve the efficiency, a dynamic loss control technique is presented. HSPICE simulations are performed with transistor models from TSMC 0.35\u03bcm N-well CMOS fabrication process. With a supply voltage of 3V, a voltage ripple of less than 15 mV is measured. The maximum efficiency is 92% with a load power of 475 mW. The converter exhibits a tracking speed of 2\u03bcs/V for both start-up and reference voltage transitions. The recovery time for a 20% load change is approximately 2.6\u03bcs.

Existing dynamic power management policies usually take conservative approaches to save disk energy, and disk energy consumption remains a serious issue. Meanwhile, the flash drive is becoming a must-have portable storage device for almost every laptop user on travel. In this paper, we propose to make another highly desired use of the flash drive - saving disk energy. This is achieved by using the flash drive as a standby buffer for caching and prefetching disk data. Our design significantly extends disk idle times with careful and deliberate consideration of the particular characteristics of the flash drive.

We find that although both approaches have advantages, one of them is most likely the most appropriate for the majority of users.","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2007.1","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271883/4271884/04271925.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2007.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Scheduling Approaches for Mixed-Parallel Applications on Heterogeneous Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Scheduling Approaches for Mixed-Parallel Applications on Heterogeneous Platforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9834481","htmlLink":"/document/4271925/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Scheduling Approaches for Mixed-Parallel Applications on Heterogeneous Platforms","confLoc":"Hagenburg, Austria","sourcePdf":"29360035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089677S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271883","isNumber":"4271884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271883","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4271884","articleId":"4271925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4271958,"authors":[{"name":"Stephane Gobron","affiliation":["Movement and Perception Laboratory, Federative Research Institute Marey UMR 6152, CNRS, University of Aix-Marseille II, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Gobron","id":"37449524600"},{"name":"Daniel Mestre","affiliation":["Movement and Perception Laboratory, Federative Research Institute Marey UMR 6152, CNRS, University of Aix-Marseille II, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Mestre","id":"37937731800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2900-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"}],"articleNumber":"4271958","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Automatic programming","Multidimensional systems","Encoding","Automata","Computer graphics","Character generation","Evolution (biology)","Laboratories","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean algebra","cellular automata","data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information visualization","GPU programming","multidimension Boolean cellular automata","encoding method","graphical processor units","Neumann neighborhood","fragment shaders programs","encoding technique","Moore neighborhood"]}],"abstract":"We propose a method for generating all possible rules of multi-dimension Boolean cellular automata (CA). Based on an original encoding method and the programming of graphical processor units (GPU), this method allows us to visualize the CA information flow in real-time so that emerging behaviors can be easily identified. Algorithms of first and von Neumann neighborhood second degrees are detailed with their respective fragment shaders programs. As symmetrical CA rules are especially useful in many research fields, we propose an encoding technique to automatically derive their codes; we then apply this technique to identify the 4096 possible cases for surface CA. To show the efficiency of our model a set of converging global behaviors are listed and described. In the last part of the paper we present methods for developing Moore neighborhood in two and in three dimensions. Finally we discuss issues concerning computation and the visualization of non-Boolean and higher dimension CA.","doi":"10.1109/IV.2007.69","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization (IV '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271943/4271944/04271958.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2007.69","publicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization (IV '07)","startPage":"33","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Visualization of Multi-dimensional Cellular Automata using GPU Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Information Visualization of Multi-dimensional Cellular Automata using GPU Programming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271958/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4271958/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868001","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Visualization of Multi-dimensional Cellular Automata using GPU Programming","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"29000033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102688S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271943","isNumber":"4271944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271943","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4271944","articleId":"4271958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4271966,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Lau","affiliation":["Key Centre of Design Computing & Cognition, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Lau","id":"37929856100"},{"name":"Andrew Vande Moere","affiliation":["Key Centre of Design Computing & Cognition, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Vande Moere","id":"37283186600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2900-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"}],"articleNumber":"4271966","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1951},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4271966","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Art","Cognition","Context modeling","Displays","Computer interfaces","Humans","Guidelines","Reflection","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information aesthetics","information visualization","visualization projects","creative design","data mapping","conceptual link"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a model of information aesthetics in the context of information visualization. It addresses the need to acknowledge a recently emerging number of visualization projects that combine information visualization techniques with principles of creative design. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of information aesthetics as a potentially independent research field within visualization that specifically focuses on the experience of aesthetics, dataset interpretation and interaction. The proposed model is based on analysing existing visualization techniques by their interpretative intent and data mapping inspiration. It reveals information aesthetics as the conceptual link between information visualization and visualization art, and includes the fields of social and ambient visualization. This model is unique in its focus on aesthetics as the artistic influence on the technical implementation and intended purpose of a visualization technique, rather than subjective aesthetic judgments of the visualization outcome. This research provides a framework for understanding aesthetics in visualization, and allows for new design guidelines and reviewing criteria.","doi":"10.1109/IV.2007.114","publicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization (IV '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization (IV '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271943/4271944/04271966.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2007.114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Model of Information Aesthetics in Information Visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4271966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Towards a Model of Information Aesthetics in Information Visualization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868009","htmlLink":"/document/4271966/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a Model of Information Aesthetics in Information Visualization","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"29000087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098769S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4271943","isNumber":"4271944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4271943","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4271944","articleId":"4271966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4272003,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Bertschi","affiliation":["University of Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Bertschi","id":"37567242400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2900-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"}],"articleNumber":"4272003","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272003","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Image reconstruction","Mirrors","Graphics","Focusing","Shape","Resumes","Humans","Handicapped aids","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","knowledge representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge visualization","deconstructivist approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IV.2007.144","publicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization (IV '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization (IV '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4271943/4271944/04272003.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2007.144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4271944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Without Knowledge Visualization?

This study measured parameters such as speed of completion, accuracy rate, task abandonment and latency of erroneous response.

The IEEE 802.16e standard systems can be considered potential candidates for these areas because of their many attractive features, which include high data rate, mobility support, etc. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an 802.16e system with the OFDMA air interface over non-stationary channel models developed for different airports. We first provide a brief introduction to the various non-stationary channel models. Next we provide a short overview of 802.16e and describe three potential channel estimation schemes. We then evaluate the performance of the 802.16e system over the proposed non-stationary channel models. We show that the proposed channel estimation methods allow good tradeoffs between channel estimation accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, we introduce a subcarrier based subcarrier based scheduling algorithm aimed to maximize the system throughput under proportional fairness, and evaluate its performance over the proposed non-stationary channel models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDMA Standard Systems in Airport Surface Area Channels","publicationTitle":"2007 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference","doi":"10.1109/ICNSURV.2007.384152","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272174/4272175/04272184.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSURV.2007.384152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 3 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDMA Standard Systems in Airport Surface Area Channels","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272184/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"April-May 2007","accessionNumber":"9719719","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDMA Standard Systems in Airport Surface Area Channels","confLoc":"Herndon, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICNSUR-00-9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095196S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272174","isNumber":"4272175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272174","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4272175","articleId":"4272184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4272296,"authors":[{"name":"Meltem Izzetoglu","affiliation":["Science and Health Systems, School of Biomedical Engineering, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/51/4268305/4272296/4272296-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Meltem Izzetoglu was born in Samsun, Turkey in 1971.

In designing these algorithms, we found the literature on parallel computation to be a rich source of inspiration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4272329/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9689745","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimation on graphs from relative measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation on graphs from relative measurements","sourcePdf":"272007-PRABIB-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076449S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"4272237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4272237","articleId":"4272329","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4272330,"authors":[{"name":"Sonia Martinez","bio":{"p":["Sonia Mart\u00ednez received the Licenciatura degree in mathematics from the Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering mathematics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2002.

For many applications, teams of mobile autonomous agents need the ability to deploy over a region, assume a specified pattern, rendezvous at a common point, or move in a synchronized manner. The objective of this article is to illustrate the use of systems theory to analyze emergent behaviors in animal groups and to design autonomous and reliable robotic networks. We present and survey some recently developed theoretical tools for modeling, analysis, and design of motion coordination algorithms in both continuous and discrete time. We pay special attention to the distributed character of coordination algorithms, the characterization of their performance, and the development of design methodologies that provide mobile networks with provably correct cooperative strategies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Algorithm design and analysis","Biological systems","Remotely operated vehicles","Biosensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Sensor systems","Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","Autonomous agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","embedded systems","mobile computing","mobile robots","motion control","multi-robot systems","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion coordination algorithms","distributed information","mobile sensors","biological systems","embedded robotic systems","systems theory","animal group emergent behaviors","reliable robotic networks","mobile autonomous agents"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCS.2007.384124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/4272237/04272330.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2007.384124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Coordination with Distributed Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion Coordination with Distributed Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272330/","volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272330/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9689746","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Coordination with Distributed Information","sourcePdf":"272007-SONIA-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117445S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"4272237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"353","xplore-issue":"4272237","articleId":"4272330","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4272331,"authors":[{"name":"Derek A.

In this paper, a novel brain MR images segmentation method is presented based on self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. The method comprises two main steps: feature extraction and pixel classification based on SOM neural network. In traditional techniques, neural network's input is the feature vector extracted from the intensity of the pixel and of its n nearest neighbors, which introduces dependency on the gray levels spatial distribution, and thus the final segmentation results are prone to be effected by noise. To enhance the robustness of the method, we perform statistical transformation to the traditional feature vector as neural network's input. Simulated brain MR images with different noise levels and intensity inhomogeneities are segmented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the traditional technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2007.179","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272484/4272485/04272663.pdf","startPage":"686","endPage":"689","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2007.179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Brain MR Images Segmentation Method Based on SOM Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Brain MR Images Segmentation Method Based on SOM Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"10300254","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4272663/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Brain MR Images Segmentation Method Based on SOM Neural Network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047093S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272484","isNumber":"4272485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272484","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4272485","articleId":"4272663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4272692,"authors":[{"name":"Saeedeh Lotfi Mohammad Abad","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering Science & Research branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeedeh","lastName":"Lotfi Mohammad Abad","id":"37088037750"},{"name":"Keivan Maghooli","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering Science & Research branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Keivan","lastName":"Maghooli","id":"37681719300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1120-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"4272692","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":431},"abstract":"Portable biomedical instrumentation has become an important part of diagnostic and treatment instrumentation, including telemedicine applications. Low voltage and low-power design tendencies prevail. Modern battery cell voltages in the range of 3-3.6 V require appropriate circuit solutions. A two-electrode bio potential amplifier design is presented, with a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), high input voltage tolerance and standard first-order high-pass characteristic. Most of these features are due to a high-gain first stage design. The circuit makes use of passive components of popular values and tolerances. Powered by a single 3 V source, the amplifier tolerates 1 V common mode voltage, 50 mA common mode current and 2 V input DC voltage, and its worst-case CMRR is 60 dB. The amplifier is intended for use in various applications, such as Holter-type monitors, defibrillators, ECG monitors, biotelemetry devices etc.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low voltage","Circuits","Biomedical measurements","Medical treatment","Instruments","Telemedicine","Batteries","Power amplifiers","Electrocardiography","Biomedical telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","defibrillators","electrocardiography","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiogram signal amplifier","portable biomedical instrumentation","medical diagnostics","treatment instrumentation","telemedicine applications","modern battery cell voltages","two-electrode bio potential amplifier design","common-mode rejection ratio","input voltage tolerance","standard first-order high-pass characteristics","high-gain first stage design","Holter-type monitors","defibrillators","ECG monitors","biotelemetry devices"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2007.208","publicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272484/4272485/04272692.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2007.208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Supply Voltage Electrocardiogram Signal Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Supply Voltage Electrocardiogram Signal Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272692/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272692/","accessionNumber":"10300280","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Supply Voltage Electrocardiogram Signal Amplifier","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041088S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272484","isNumber":"4272485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272484","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4272485","articleId":"4272692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4272694,"authors":[{"name":"Yalan Ye","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yalan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37695253600"},{"name":"Xun Yao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Yao","id":"37931601200"},{"name":"Zhi-Lin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Lin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37715577000"},{"name":"Quanyi Mo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Quanyi","lastName":"Mo","id":"37924817400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1120-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"4272694","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Independent component analysis","Neural networks","Source separation","Vectors","Computer science","Electrocardiography","Electrodes","Blind source separation","Noise robustness","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","electrocardiography","independent component analysis","medical signal processing","neural nets","obstetrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fetal electrocardiogram","maternal skin","blind source separation","independent component analysis","neural network","blind source extraction","noninvasive extraction algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272694","abstract":"The extraction of fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) from maternal skin electrode measurements is an open problem in recent decades. Many researchers proposed blind source separation (BSS) or Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based neural network methods to address this problem. However, by these methods all of the source signals are simultaneously separated, but in fact only one source signal is the desired FECG and others are unwanted ones. In contrast, blind source extraction (BSE) only outputs a single source and is closely related to BSS, which is obviously a better choice. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive extraction algorithm based on ICA neural network that can extract the desired FECG with little noise as the first extracted signal. The algorithm is very robust to outliers. The real-data world has shown that the algorithm can achieve satisfying results.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2007.210","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272484/4272485/04272694.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"809","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2007.210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Extraction Algorithm Based on ICA Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Extraction Algorithm Based on ICA Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"10300282","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4272694/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Extraction Algorithm Based on ICA Neural Network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-01-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049915S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272484","isNumber":"4272485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4272485","articleId":"4272694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4272727,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li","id":"37857998600"},{"name":"Hao Sun","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37932750900"},{"name":"Yinjing Guo","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yinjing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37596464800"},{"name":"Hongyu Sun","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Hongyu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596249600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1120-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"4272727","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal denoising","Wavelet transforms","Signal processing","Fourier transforms","Frequency","Noise reduction","Sun","Filters","Educational institutions","Biomedical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical signal processing","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse signal denoising","integer lifting","wavelet transform","multiresolution characteristics","translation invariant method","pulse signal processing"]}],"abstract":"In view of the defects of conventional wavelet transform in denoising the pulse signal, a new denoising method based on the integer lifting scheme is addressed .The integer lifting scheme works without Fourier transform, which inherits the multi-resolution characteristic of the conventional wavelet transform, and thus can speed the operation greatly.

The simultaneous recording of ECG signs is essential for the identification of disorders of the cardiac rhythm, extremely useful for the diagnosis and management of heart abnormalities such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), and offers helpful clues to the presence of generalised disorders that affect the rest of the body, such as electrolyte disturbances and drug intoxication.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272484/4272485/04272752.pdf","startPage":"1035","endPage":"1038","publicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2007.268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2007.268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel System-On-Chip Design of Wearable ECG Signs Monitoring Node Into Medical Vest","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","System-on-a-chip","Electrocardiography","Medical diagnostic imaging","Fabrics","Wireless sensor networks","Intelligent sensors","Signal processing","Rhythm","Health information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","electrocardiography","fabrics","system-on-chip","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip design","ECG signs monitoring","medical vest","intelligent fabric","wireless sensor network node","ISM band","cardiac rhythm","heart abnormalities","myocardial infarction","heart attack","electrolyte disturbances","drug intoxication","frequency 2.45 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel System-On-Chip Design of Wearable ECG Signs Monitoring Node Into Medical Vest","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272752/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"10300677","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel System-On-Chip Design of Wearable ECG Signs Monitoring Node Into Medical Vest","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06053S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272484","isNumber":"4272485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4272485","articleId":"4272752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4272794,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhu","affiliation":["College of Mechanical & Electric Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37401251400"},{"name":"Josef Guttmann","affiliation":["Department Anaesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Guttmann","id":"37540884200"},{"name":"Knut Moller","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Furtwangen University, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany"],"firstName":"Knut","lastName":"Moller","id":"37544338300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1120-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"}],"articleNumber":"4272794","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272794","abstract":"Airway pressure control of respiratory mechanics is crucial for ventilated patients. However, respiratory mechanics are nonlinear and are varying considerably amongst individual patients. In addition nonlinear interactions of a number of controls such as PEEP, Vt,fl02 - just to name a few - complicate the situation for the respiratory therapist on intensive care units. In this paper an alternative approach to traditional control methods - a neural network predictive controller - is proposed to establish an adaptive control of the airway pressure according to the individual features of a mechanically ventilated patient. The experimental results show that this approach can make the ventilator output follow the command pressure accurately as well as successfully identify the individual nonlinear respiratory mechanics of severely sick patients.Control of Respiratory Mechanics with Artificial Neural Networks Hui Zhu College of Mechanical & Electric Eng.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2007.310","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1205","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272484/4272485/04272794.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2007.310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Respiratory Mechanics with Artificial Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Lungs","Pressure control","Respiratory system","Ventilation","Immune system","Mechanical factors","Electrical resistance measurement","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","medical control systems","neural nets","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","airway pressure control","adaptive control","mechanically ventilated patient","nonlinear respiratory mechanics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Control of Respiratory Mechanics with Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272794/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2007","accessionNumber":"10300709","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Respiratory Mechanics with Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-04-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077557S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272484","isNumber":"4272485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4272485","articleId":"4272794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4272848,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Cornea","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Cornea","id":"37869778000"},{"name":"Cristina Anderson","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Anderson","id":"37876462900"},{"name":"John Harrison","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Harrison","id":"37885081600"},{"name":"Ping Tak Peter Tang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Ping Tak Peter","lastName":"Tang","id":"37366131300"},{"name":"Eric Schneider","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37879709800"},{"name":"Charles Tsen","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Tsen","id":"37394030900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2854-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"4272848","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floating-point arithmetic","Encoding","Hardware","Application software","Cornea","Software standards","Robustness","Law","Legal factors","Software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","floating point arithmetic","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software implementation","IEEE 754R decimal floating-point arithmetic","software packages","binary encoding format"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE Standard 754-1985 for binary floating-point arithmetic [1] was revised [2], and an important addition is the definition of decimal floating-point arithmetic. This is intended mainly to provide a robust, reliable framework for financial applications that are often subject to legal requirements concerning rounding and precision of the results, because the binary floating-point arithmetic may introduce small but unacceptable errors. Using binary floating-point calculations to emulate decimal calculations in order to correct this issue has led to the existence of numerous proprietary software packages, each with its own characteristics and capabilities. IEEE 754R decimal arithmetic should unify the ways decimal floating-point calculations are carried out on various platforms. New algorithms and properties are presented in this paper which are used in a software implementation of the IEEE 754R decimal floatingpoint arithmetic, with emphasis on using binary operations efficiently. The focus is on rounding techniques for decimal values stored in binary format, but algorithms for the more important or interesting operations of addition, multiplication, division, and conversions between binary and decimal floating-point formats are also outlined. Performance results are included for a wider range of operations, showing promise that our approach is viable for applications that require decimal floating-point calculations.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2007.7","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272835/4272836/04272848.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2007.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Software Implementation of the IEEE 754R Decimal Floating-Point Arithmetic Using the Binary Encoding Format","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272848/","displayDocTitle":"A Software Implementation of the IEEE 754R Decimal Floating-Point Arithmetic Using the Binary Encoding Format","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9830527","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272848/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Software Implementation of the IEEE 754R Decimal Floating-Point Arithmetic Using the Binary Encoding Format","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"28540029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047571S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272835","isNumber":"4272836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272835","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4272836","articleId":"4272848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4272852,"authors":[{"name":"Libo Huang","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Libo","lastName":"Huang","id":"37292522800"},{"name":"Li Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Shen","id":"37287404400"},{"name":"Kui Dai","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Dai","id":"37267140600"},{"name":"Zhiying Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhiying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2854-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"4272852","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":67,"totalDownloads":933},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Delay","Computer architecture","Costs","Encoding","Floating-point arithmetic","Process design","Application software","Multiplexing","Roundoff errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","floating point arithmetic","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-precision floating-point multiply-add fused unit design","processor design","multimedia applications","IEEE precisions","single instruction multiple data feature","precision mode dependent multiplexers"]}],"abstract":"The floating-point multiply-add fused (MAF) unit sets a new trend in the processor design to speed up floatingpoint performance in scientific and multimedia applications.

The proposed MAF unit can perform either one double-precision or two parallel single-precision operations using about 18% more hardware than a conventional double-precision MAF unit and with 9% increase in delay. To accommodate the simultaneous computation of two single-precision MAF operations, several basic modules of double-precision MAF unit are redesigned.

It has been tested at over 5 GHz. The design supports an extremely aggressive cycle time of 13 FO4 using a technology independent measure. For most dependent instructions, its fused multiply-add dataflow has only 6 effective pipeline stages. This is nearly equivalent to its predecessor, the Power 5, even though its technology independent frequency has increased over 70%. Overall the frequency has improved over 100%. It achieves this high performance through aggressive feedback paths, circuit design and layout. The pipeline has 7 stages but data may be fed back to dependent operations prior to rounding and complete normalization. Division and square root algorithms are also described which take advantage of high-precision linear approximation hardware for obtaining a reciprocal or reciprocal square root approximation.","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272835/4272836/04272853.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"86","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2007.26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2007.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P6 Binary Floating-Point Unit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Frequency","Yarn","Testing","Circuit synthesis","Delay","Time measurement","Approximation algorithms","Linear approximation","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing","program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-point unit","next generation PowerPC","technology independent measure","multiply-add dataflow","aggressive feedback paths","square root algorithms","high-precision linear approximation hardware","P6"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Floating-point unit","denormal result handling","aggressive data forwarding","high-frequency design","data processing without stalls."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"P6 Binary Floating-Point Unit","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272853/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9834575","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P6 Binary Floating-Point Unit","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"28540077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049398S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272835","isNumber":"4272836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272835","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4272836","articleId":"4272853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4272854,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Burgess","affiliation":["Cardiff School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Burgess","id":"37322624700"},{"name":"Chris N.

Research then turned to software functions. This situation may be about to change again with the advent of reconfigurable co-processors based on field-programmable gate arrays. Such co-processors now have a capacity that allows them to accommodate double-precision floating-point computing.

Our multipliers are based on a new algorithm for decimal carry-save multioperand addition that uses a novel BCD-4221 recoding for decimal digits. It significantly improves the area and latency of the partial product reduction tree with respect to previous proposals. We also present three schemes for fast and efficient generation of partial products in parallel. The recoding of the BCD-8421 multiplier operand into minimally redundant signed-digit radix-10, radix-4 and radix-5 representations using new recoders reduces the complexity of partial product generation. In addition, SD radix-4 and radix-5 recodings allow the reuse of a conventional parallel binary radix-4 multiplier to perform combined binary/decimal multiplications. Evaluation results show that the proposed architectures have interesting area-delay figures compared to conventional Booth radix-4 and radix-8 parallel binary multipliers and other representative alternatives for decimal multiplication.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2007.6","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272835/4272836/04272866.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2007.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Family of High.Performance Parallel Decimal Multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272866/","displayDocTitle":"A New Family of High.Performance Parallel Decimal Multipliers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9830544","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272866/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Family of High.Performance Parallel Decimal Multipliers","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"28540195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050204S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272835","isNumber":"4272836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272835","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4272836","articleId":"4272866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4272871,"authors":[{"name":"Leonel Sousa","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department INESC-ID/IST, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37265872100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2854-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"4272871","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Cathode ray tubes","Motion estimation","Image converters","Computer architecture","Digital arithmetic","Dynamic range","Video sequences","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image resolution","image sequences","motion estimation","residue number systems","video signal processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnitude comparison","RNS","conjugate moduli","residue number systems","carry free arithmetic","arithmetic units","VLSI architecture","sum-of-absolute differences","motion estimation","video sequences","FPGA","high resolution images"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Method for Magnitude Comparison in RNS Based on Two Pairs of Conjugate Moduli","abstract":"The non-positional nature of residue number systems (RNS) is very useful to achieve carry free arithmetic. However it makes the comparison of numbers more difficult than in the traditional weighted number systems: there is no any efficient general method for magnitude comparison in RNS. Moreover, magnitude comparison for RNS that rely on pairs of conjugate moduli, which are not relatively prime moduli sets recently proposed because of the large dynamic ranges and the simplicity of the arithmetic units, is a new unsolved problem. In this paper an efficient method and a VLSI architecture is proposed for magnitude comparison in RNS based on sets formed by two pairs of conjugate moduli. This proposed method is much more efficient than the other known ones and is the only one valid for moduli sets not formed by relatively prime integers. The method has been applied to design a very fast Sum-of-Absolute Differences (SAD) unit for motion estimation in video sequences that performs the function entirely within the RNS channels. Experimental results show that this new SAD unit, implemented in the internal memory blocks of the xc2vp50-7 FPGA, is capable of achieving the high throughput required to perform real-time motion estimation in high resolution images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2007.16","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2007.16","startPage":"240","endPage":"250","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272835/4272836/04272871.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH '07)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272871/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Method for Magnitude Comparison in RNS Based on Two Pairs of Conjugate Moduli","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9830549","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4272871/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Method for Magnitude Comparison in RNS Based on Two Pairs of Conjugate Moduli","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"28540240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044983S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272835","isNumber":"4272836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272835","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4272836","articleId":"4272871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4272873,"authors":[{"name":"Vassil Dimitrov","affiliation":["ATIPS Labs, CISaC, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Vassil","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37271934700"},{"name":"Laurent Imbert","affiliation":["ATIPS Labs, CISaC, University of Calgary, Canada","LIRMM, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Imbert","id":"37271937300"},{"name":"Andrew Zakaluzny","affiliation":["ATIPS Laboratories, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zakaluzny","id":"37939065300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2854-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"4272873","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272873","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Cryptography","Discrete cosine transforms","Throughput","Image processing","Digital arithmetic","Signal design","Cost function","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-base number system","constant integer multiplication","formal proof","sublinear time"]}],"abstract":"This paper explores the use of the double-base number system (DBNS) for constant integer multiplication.

Service-oriented applications are large-scale distributed applications, typically highly dynamic, by definition loosely coupled and often unstable due to the unreliability of Web Services, which can be moved, deleted, and are subject to various sources of failures. In this paper, we propose customizable fault-tolerance connectors to add fault-tolerance to unreliable Web Services, thus filling the gap between clients and Web Service providers. Connectors are designed by clients, providers or dependability experts using the original WSDL description of the service. These connectors insert detection actions (e.g. runtime assertions) and recovery mechanisms (based on various replications strategies). The connectors can use identical or equivalent available service replicas. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2007.48","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272934/4272935/04272955.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2007.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Tolerance Connectors for Unreliable Web Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272955/","displayDocTitle":"Fault Tolerance Connectors for Unreliable Web Services","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9834581","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272955/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Tolerance Connectors for Unreliable Web Services","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"28550051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068563S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272934","isNumber":"4272935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272934","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4272935","articleId":"4272955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4272961,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Rahmati","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Rahmati","id":"37543307000"},{"name":"Lin Zhong","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37279001600"},{"name":"Matti Hiltunen","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Florham Park, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Hiltunen","id":"37273276300"},{"name":"Rittwik Jana","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Florham Park, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Rittwik","lastName":"Jana","id":"37271233100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2855-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3927"}],"articleNumber":"4272961","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":463},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Security","Passive RFID tags","Electromagnetic coupling","Databases","Logic","Packaging","Reliability","Redundancy","Electrostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","radiofrequency identification","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability techniques","RFID-based object tracking","radio frequency identification","tag identification","intertag distance","system reliability"]}],"abstract":"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has the potential to dramatically improve numerous industrial practices. However, it still faces many challenges, including security and reliability, which may limit its use in many application scenarios. While security has received considerable attention, reliability has escaped much of the research scrutiny. In this work, we investigate the reliability challenges in RFID-based tracking applications, where objects (e.g., pallets, packages, and people) tagged with low-cost passive RFID tags pass by the RFID reader's read zone. Our experiments show that the reliability of tag identification is affected by several factors, including the inter-tag distance, the distance between the tag and antenna, the orientation of the tag with respect to the antenna, and the location of the tag on the object. We demonstrate that RFID system reliability can be significantly improved with the application of simple redundancy techniques.","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2007.81","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272934/4272935/04272961.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2007.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Techniques for RFID-Based Object Tracking Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272961/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Techniques for RFID-Based Object Tracking Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9861672","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272961/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Techniques for RFID-Based Object Tracking Applications","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"28550113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047039S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272934","isNumber":"4272935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272934","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4272935","articleId":"4272961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4272969,"authors":[{"name":"Jon G.

This model corrects errors associated with the common assumption that system times to failure follow a homogeneous Poisson process. Separate generalized failure distributions are used to model catastrophic failures and usage dependent data corruptions for each hard drive. Catastrophic failure restoration is represented by a three-parameter Weibull, so the model can include a minimum time to restore as a function of data transfer rate and hard drive storage capacity. Data can be scrubbed as a background operation to eliminate corrupted data that, in the event of a simultaneous catastrophic failure, results in double disk failures. Field-based times to failure data and mathematic justification for a new model are presented. Model results have been verified and predict between 2 to 1,500 times as many double disk failures as that estimated using the current mean time to data loss method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2007.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272935","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272934/4272935/04272969.pdf","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Reliability Modeling of RAID Storage Systems","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2007.41","startPage":"175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Reliability Modeling of RAID Storage Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272969/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9834587","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4272969/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Reliability Modeling of RAID Storage Systems","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"28550175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063942S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272934","isNumber":"4272935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272934","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4272935","articleId":"4272969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4272972,"authors":[{"name":"Jay J.

A minimal erasure is a set of erasures that leads to irrecoverable data loss and in which every erasure is necessary and sufficient for this to be so. The MEL is the enumeration of all minimal erasures. An XOR-based erasure code has an irregular structure that may permit it to tolerate faults at and beyond its Hamming distance. The MEL completely describes the fault tolerance of an XOR-based erasure code at and beyond its Hamming distance; it is therefore a useful metric for comparing the fault tolerance of such codes. We also propose an algorithm that efficiently determines the MEL of an erasure code. This algorithm uses the structure of the erasure code to efficiently determine the MEL. We show that, in practice, the number of minimal erasures for a given code is much less than the total number of sets of erasures that lead to data loss: in our empirical results for one corpus of codes, there were over 80 times fewer minimal erasures. We use the proposed algorithm to identify the most fault tolerant XOR-based erasure code for all possible systematic erasure codes with up to seven data symbols and up to seven parity symbols.","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272934/4272935/04272972.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2007.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2007.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4272972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining Fault Tolerance of XOR-Based Erasure Codes Efficiently","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Hamming distance","Reed-Solomon codes","Fault diagnosis","Availability","Decoding","Costs","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XOR-based erasure codes","fault tolerance metric","minimal erasures list","irrecoverable data loss","hamming distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4272972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Determining Fault Tolerance of XOR-Based Erasure Codes Efficiently","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4272972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9834590","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining Fault Tolerance of XOR-Based Erasure Codes Efficiently","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"28550206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080487S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272934","isNumber":"4272935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272934","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4272935","articleId":"4272972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4272979,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In addition, it stores a parity bit for all the registers, re-using the ECC circuitry for parity generation and checking. ParShield has no SDC AVF and a small average DUE AVF of 0.040 and 0.010 for the integer and floating-point register files, respectively.

We propose a new and robust structure-aware lifetime reliability model at the architecture-level, where devices only vulnerable to failure mechanisms and the effective stress condition of these devices are taken into account for the failure rate of microarchitecture structures. In addition, we present this reliability analysis framework based on a new concept, called the FIT of reference circuit or FORC, which allows architects to quantify failure rates without having to delve into low-level circuit- and technology-specific details of the implemented architecture. This is done through a onetime characterization of a reference circuit needed to quantify the reference FITs for each class of modeled failure mechanisms for a given technology and implementation style. With this new reliability modeling framework, architects are empowered to proceed with architecture-level reliability analysis independent of technological and environmental parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272934/4272935/04273004.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"543","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2007.8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2007.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Architecture-Level Lifetime Reliability Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Circuits","Microarchitecture","Robustness","Electromigration","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Thermal stresses","Rivers","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","performance evaluation","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architecture-level lifetime reliability modeling","structure-aware lifetime reliability model","failure mechanisms","reliability analysis framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Architecture-Level Lifetime Reliability Modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273004/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9834615","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Architecture-Level Lifetime Reliability Modeling","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"28550534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068194S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272934","isNumber":"4272935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272934","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4272935","articleId":"4273004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273008,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Oliner","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Stanford, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Oliner","id":"37267055900"},{"name":"Jon Stearley","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Stearley","id":"37543099800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2855-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3927"}],"articleNumber":"4273008","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":191,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1693},"abstract":"If we hope to automatically detect and diagnose failures in large-scale computer systems, we must study real deployed systems and the data they generate.

For these applications to be able to predictably and efficiently deliver services to end users, it is therefore, critical to understand and control their runtime behavior. In a datacenter environment, for instance, understanding the end-to-end dynamic behavior of certain IT subsystems, from the time requests are made to when responses are generated and finally, received, is a key prerequisite for improving application response, to provide required levels of performance, or to meet service level agreements (SLAs). The E2EProf toolkit enables the efficient and nonintrusive capture and analysis of end-to-end program behavior for complex enterprise applications. E2EProf permits an enterprise to recognize and analyze performance problems when they occur - online, to take corrective actions as soon as possible and wherever necessary along the paths currently taken by user requests - end-to-end, and to do so without the need to instrument applications - nonintrusively. Online analysis exploits a novel signal analysis algorithm, termed pathmap, which dynamically detects the causal paths taken by client requests through application and backend servers and annotates these paths with end-to-end latencies and with the contributions to these latencies from different path components. Thus, with pathmap, it is possible to dynamically identify the bottlenecks present in selected servers or services and to detect the abnormal or unusual performance behaviors indicative of potential problems or overloads. Pathmap and the E2EProf toolkit successfully detect causal request paths and associated performance bottlenecks in the RUBiS ebay-like multi-tier Web application and in one of the datacenter of our industry partner, Delta Air Lines.","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2007.38","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4272934/4272935/04273026.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4272935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2007.38","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)","startPage":"749","endPage":"758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"E2EProf: Automated End-to-End Performance Management for Enterprise Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"E2EProf: Automated End-to-End Performance Management for Enterprise Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273026/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273026/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9834636","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"E2EProf: Automated End-to-End Performance Management for Enterprise Systems","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"28550749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070572S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4272934","isNumber":"4272935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4272934","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4272935","articleId":"4273026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4273098,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Lefurgy","affiliation":["IBM Research GmbH, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Lefurgy","id":"37265517300"},{"name":"Xiaorui Wang","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaorui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281385700"},{"name":"Malcolm Ware","affiliation":["IBM Research GmbH, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Malcolm","lastName":"Ware","id":"37410181400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2779-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4273098","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":152,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":610},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Server-Level Power Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273098","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Open loop systems","Control systems","Energy consumption","Adaptive control","Power measurement","Control system analysis","Performance analysis","Stability analysis","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","feedback","network servers","power control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["server-level power control","peak power consumption","high-density server","feedback controller","system-level power measurement","control theoretic methodology","control loop design","system stability","power supply constraint","open-loop policy","closed-loop control","open-loop control"]}],"abstract":"We present a technique that controls the peak power consumption of a high-density server by implementing a feedback controller that uses precise, system-level power measurement to periodically select the highest performance state while keeping the system within a fixed power constraint. A control theoretic methodology is applied to systematically design this control loop with analytic assurances of system stability and controller performance, despite unpredictable workloads and running environments. In a real server we are able to control power over a 1 second period to within 1 W. Additionally, we have observed that power over an 8 second period can be controlled to within 0.1 W. We believe that we are the first to demonstrate such precise control of power in a real server. Conventional servers respond to power supply constraint situations by using simple open-loop policies to set a safe performance level in order to limit peak power consumption. We show that closed-loop control can provide higher performance under these conditions and test this technique on an IBM BladeCenter HS20 server. Experimental results demonstrate that closed-loop control provides up to 82% higher application performance compared to open-loop control and up to 17% higher performance compared to a widely used ad-hoc technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICAC.2007.35","startPage":"4","publicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273085/4273086/04273098.pdf","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC.2007.35","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273098/","displayDocTitle":"Server-Level Power Control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273098/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9857894","publicationDate":"June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Server-Level Power Control","confLoc":"Jacksonville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27790004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061121S","chronDate":"11-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4273085","isNumber":"4273086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273085","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"4273086","articleId":"4273098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273099,"authors":[{"name":"Ripal Nathuji","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ripal","lastName":"Nathuji","id":"37892021100"},{"name":"Canturk Isci","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Canturk","lastName":"Isci","id":"37564776200"},{"name":"Eugene Gorbatov","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Gorbatov","id":"37845939900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2779-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4273099","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":470},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Thermal management","Costs","Cooling","Hardware","Power system management","Financial management","Environmental management","Energy consumption","Technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","power aware computing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["platform heterogeneity-aware management","data center","power-efficient management","enterprise computing environment","intelligent workload allocation method","enterprise workload management"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Platform Heterogeneity for Power Efficient Data Centers","doi":"10.1109/ICAC.2007.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273086","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273085/4273086/04273099.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC.2007.16","startPage":"5","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273099","abstract":"It has recently become clear that power management is of critical importance in modern enterprise computing environments. The traditional drive for higher performance has influenced trends towards consolidation and higher densities, artifacts enabled by virtualization and new small form factor server blades. The resulting effect has been increased power and cooling requirements in data centers which elevate ownership costs and put more pressure on rack and enclosure densities. To address these issues, in this paper, we enable power-efficient management of enterprise workloads by exploiting a fundamental characteristic of data centers: \"platform heterogeneity\". This heterogeneity stems from the architectural and management-capability variations of the underlying platforms. We define an intelligent workload allocation method that leverages heterogeneity characteristics and efficiently maps workloads to the best fitting platforms, significantly improving the power efficiency of the whole data center. We perform this allocation by employing a novel analytical prediction layer that accurately predicts workload power/performance across different platform architectures and power management capabilities. This prediction infrastructure relies upon platform and workload descriptors that we define as part of our work. Our allocation scheme achieves on average 20% improvements in power efficiency for representative heterogeneous data center configurations, highlighting the significant potential of heterogeneity-aware management.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9857895","htmlLink":"/document/4273099/","conferenceDate":"11-15 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Platform Heterogeneity for Power Efficient Data Centers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Platform Heterogeneity for Power Efficient Data Centers","confLoc":"Jacksonville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27790005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096859S","chronDate":"11-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4273085","isNumber":"4273086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273085","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4273086","articleId":"4273099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4273116,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Hoshino","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Hoshino","id":"37290080100"},{"name":"Kazuo Goda","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Goda","id":"37296993200"},{"name":"Masaru Kitsuregawa","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo"],"firstName":"Masaru","lastName":"Kitsuregawa","id":"37283954000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2779-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4273116","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Visual databases","Costs","Engines","Database systems","Information science","Paper technology","Prototypes","Graphical user interfaces","Data visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","database management systems","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database structural deterioration","online monitoring","autonomic database reorganizer","data structure"]}],"abstract":"The paper proposes a structural deterioration monitor of database, which is an essential building block to realize an autonomic database reorganizer.

The objective of this research work is to detect such camouflaged defect. Since the texture similarity between the background and the defect is the premise for accomplishing camouflage, an intensive texture analysis should be able to discriminate defect from its background. In the proposed work we intended to employ Co-occurrence matrix based texture features are computed within the block, a small region of the image. Finally defective portions are detected by cluster analysis and identified through!. Watershed segmentation. Several experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model to spot camouflaged defects.

In all the applications, outliers need to be detected to enhance the accuracy of the classifiers. Several different techniques, such as statistical, distance-based and deviation-based outlier detection exist to detect outliers. Many of these techniques use filter method. A wrapper method using the concept of instance typicality may also be used to detect outliers. This paper deals with a new wrapper method that builds an initial model using neural networks and treats values at the output of neurons in the output layer as the typicality scores. Instances with lowest output values are treated as potential outliers. In addition, the method is also useful to build compact and accurate classifiers by selecting a few most typical instances resulting in significant reduction in storage space. The method is generic and thus can also be used for instance selection with any kind of classifiers. Resultant compact models are useful for imputation of missing values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273197/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9863672","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273197/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Use of Instance Typicality for Efficient Detection of Outliers with Neural Network Classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Instance Typicality for Efficient Detection of Outliers with Neural Network Classifiers","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"26350225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047833S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273128","isNumber":"4273129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273128","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4273129","articleId":"4273197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4273213,"authors":[{"name":"Sriparna Saha","affiliation":["Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sriparna","lastName":"Saha","id":"38182933000"},{"name":"Susmita Sur-Kolay","affiliation":["Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Sur-Kolay","id":"38272422400"},{"name":"Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sanghamitra","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37270160000"},{"name":"Parthasarathi Dasgupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, India"],"firstName":"Parthasarathi","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37288667500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2635-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4273213","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Clocks","Flip-flops","Timing","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic mutations","Acceleration","Convergence","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","clocks","flip-flops","genetic algorithms","logic partitioning","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective genetic algorithm","k-way equipartitioning","point set","CAD-VLSI","buffered clock-tree design","optimization","crossover operators","mutation operators","Flip- flops"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiobjective optimization","cluster analysis","balanced partitioning","genetic algorithm","low power clock trees in nanometer chips."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273213","abstract":"Buffered clock-tree design, with cells at its leaves, are known to meet timing and skew requirements better. Clustering of flip-flops leads to reduced clock-tree wirelengths and power-efficient layouts. In this paper, the problem of clustering flip-flops in a given placement is formulated as Multi-way Equi-Partitioning of a given point set, such that (i) total area of the partition (ii) area of the largest partition and (Hi) total deviation of the partitions, are minimal. For this computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problem, also relevant to design of semi-synchronous systems, a technique based on genetic algorithm, is proposed. Crossover and mutation operators specific to the k-way equipartitioning problem, have been designed and a new greedy heuristic operator is employed to accelerate the convergence. Results on data sets obtained from layouts of ISCAS89 benchmark circuit demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.66","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"9th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273129","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273128/4273129/04273213.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm for k-way Equipartitioning of a Point Set with Application to CAD-VLSI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273213/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm for k-way Equipartitioning of a Point Set with Application to CAD-VLSI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273213/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9863688","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm for k-way Equipartitioning of a Point Set with Application to CAD-VLSI","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"26350281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052727S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273128","isNumber":"4273129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273128","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4273129","articleId":"4273213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4273264,"authors":[{"name":"Elaine J.

Semi-supervised segmentation means here that the character sequence constituting a word presented on the image is known, but the character boundaries are not given and need to be automatically determined. The semi-supervised word segmentation can be useful in analytic writer-dependent approach to handwriting recognition, where the training set for personalized character classifier must be created for each writer from the text corpus consisting of text samples of an individual writer. The method described here over-segments the word images into sequences of graphemes in the first step. Then such grapheme sequences subdivision is sought, which results in the hypothetical character images sets maximizing average similarity in subsets corresponding to characters from the alphabet. It leads to the combinatorial optimization problem with enormously large search space. The suboptimal solution of this problem can be found using evolutionary algorithm. The sample character images extracted in this way can be used to train character classifiers. Some preliminary results of handwriting segmentation are presented in the paper and compared with fully supervised segmentation carried out by a human.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIM.2007.58","publicationTitle":"6th International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273478/4273479/04273541.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"321","doi":"10.1109/CISIM.2007.58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Supervised Handwritten Word Segmentation Using Character Samples Similarity Maximization and Evolutionary Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Supervised Handwritten Word Segmentation Using Character Samples Similarity Maximization and Evolutionary Algorithm","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273541/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9867945","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273541/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Supervised Handwritten Word Segmentation Using Character Samples Similarity Maximization and Evolutionary Algorithm","confLoc":"Elk, Poland","sourcePdf":"28940316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04515S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4273478","isNumber":"4273479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4273479","articleId":"4273541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4273555,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Grande","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Grande","id":"37280689300"},{"name":"Jos A.

The stability of these formulations is also analyzed by means of the von Neumann method.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2007.899921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4099326/04273555.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2007.899921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099326","startPage":"324","endPage":"327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Equivalence of Several FDTD Formulations for Modeling Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Double-Negative Metamaterials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Equivalence of Several FDTD Formulations for Modeling Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Double-Negative Metamaterials","chronOrPublicationDate":"2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2007","accessionNumber":"9607593","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273555/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Equivalence of Several FDTD Formulations for Modeling Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Double-Negative Metamaterials","sourcePdf":"06lawp01-grande.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072078S","chronDate":"2007","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4099326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4099326","articleId":"4273555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273559,"authors":[{"name":"Leung Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Tacoma, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Leung","lastName":"Tsang","id":"37276240600"},{"name":"Boping Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Tacoma, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Boping","lastName":"Wu","id":"37652787600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4273559","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic fields","Nonhomogeneous media","Surface waves","Dielectrics","Permittivity","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic field theory","electromagnetic fields","Green's function methods","inhomogeneous media","magnetic moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","Hertzian dipoles","layered media","Green's function","fast all modes method","surface wave modes","leaky wave modes","Pentium IV PC","Matlab","numerical modified steepest descent method","pole proximities","half-space extraction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FAM","Green's function","improper modes","layered media","leaky wave modes"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic Fields of Hertzian Dipoles in Layered Media of Moderate Thickness Including the Effects of All Modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273559","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2007.899917","startPage":"316","endPage":"319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4099326/04273559.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2007.899917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099326","abstract":"Fast numerical methods are developed to compute the electromagnetic fields of Hertzian dipole of layered media (layered medium Green's function) of moderate thickness for the entire distance range. The method consists of using a fast all modes (FAM) method of determining all mode locations in the complex plane. The modes include surface wave modes, leaky wave modes, and improper modes. For the case of layer thickness of one wavelength, it requires only 0.12 CPU seconds as preprocessing to determine 400 mode locations accurately in the complex plane using a Pentium IV 3.2 GHz PC with Matlab. The mode locations are required only to be computed once. The numerical modified steepest descent method (NMSP) is then used to compute the steepest descent integral with all the pole proximities extracted and accounted for by using incomplete error functions. With the extraction of the poles, the NMSP requires no more than six quadrature points to compute fields at distances larger than 0.02 wavelength. The CPU per distance point based on the FAM/NMSP method is less than 3 ms for all distance ranges. The accuracy of the method has been confirmed to within 0.2% from the benchmark calculations of the half-space extraction method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273559/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4273559/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2007","accessionNumber":"9616281","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Fields of Hertzian Dipoles in Layered Media of Moderate Thickness Including the Effects of All Modes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Fields of Hertzian Dipoles in Layered Media of Moderate Thickness Including the Effects of All Modes","sourcePdf":"06lawp01-tsang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05629S","chronDate":"2007","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4099326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4099326","articleId":"4273559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4273560,"authors":[{"name":"Juan F.

It is based on the information contained in the thermal signal emitted from major superficial vessels. This signal is acquired through a highly sensitive thermal imaging system. Temperature on the vessel is modulated by pulsative blood flow. To compute the frequency of modulation (pulse), we extract a line-based region along the vessel. Then, we apply fast Fourier transform (FFT) to individual points along this line of interest to capitalize on the pulse's thermal propagation effect. Finally, we use an adaptive estimation function on the average FFT outcome to quantify the pulse. We have carried out experiments on a data set of 34 subjects and compared the pulse computed from our thermal signal analysis method to concomitant ground-truth measurements obtained through a standard contact sensor (piezo-electric transducer). The performance of the new method ranges from 88.52% to 90.33% depending on the clarity of the vessel's thermal imprint. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that cardiac pulse has been measured several feet away from a subject with passive means.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4273599/04273606.pdf","startPage":"1418","endPage":"1426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.891930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.891930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contact-Free Measurement of Cardiac Pulse Based on the Analysis of Thermal Imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse measurements","Image analysis","Pulse modulation","Anthropometry","Humans","Temperature sensors","Blood flow","Frequency modulation","Data mining","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","biomedical measurement","biomedical optical imaging","biothermics","blood vessels","cardiovascular system","fast Fourier transforms","haemodynamics","infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation function","thermal propagation effect","FFT","fast Fourier transform","pulsative blood flow","superficial vessels","thermal signal","thermal imagery","contact-free measurement","cardiac pulse measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filtering","cardiac pulse","fast Fourier transform (FFT)","medical imaging","thermal imaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electrocardiography","Heart Rate","Humans","Models, Biological","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Skin Temperature","Thermography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Contact-Free Measurement of Cardiac Pulse Based on the Analysis of Thermal Imagery","volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4273606/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9615961","pubMedId":"17694862","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contact-Free Measurement of Cardiac Pulse Based on the Analysis of Thermal Imagery","sourcePdf":"54tbme08-garbey.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077262S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4273599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"227","xplore-issue":"4273599","articleId":"4273606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273612,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Matos","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics, University Hospitals of Leicester, Leicester, UK","Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4273599/4273612/4273612-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sergio Matos (S'00\u2013M'07) was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1976.

In this paper, we present a system for the automatic analysis of 24-h, continuous, ambulatory recordings of cough. The system uses audio recordings from a miniature microphone and the detection algorithm is based on statistical models of the time-spectral characteristics of cough sounds. We validated the system against manual counts obtained by a trained observer on 40 ambulatory recordings and our results show a median sensitivity value of 85.7%, median positive predictive value of 94.7% and median false positive rate of 0.8 events/h. An analysis application was developed, with a graphical user interface, allowing the use of the system in clinical settings by technical or medical staff. The result of the analysis of a recording session is presented as a concise, graphical-based report. The modular nature of the system interface facilitates its enhancement with the integration of further modules.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automated System for 24-h Monitoring of Cough Frequency: The Leicester Cough Monitor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.900811","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4273599/04273612.pdf","startPage":"1472","endPage":"1479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.900811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273612/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Automated System for 24-h Monitoring of Cough Frequency: The Leicester Cough Monitor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4273612/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9617249","pubMedId":"17694868","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automated System for 24-h Monitoring of Cough Frequency: The Leicester Cough Monitor","sourcePdf":"54tbme08-matos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086466S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4273599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4273599","articleId":"4273612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273623,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Fei Teng","affiliation":["Joint Research Center for Biomedical Engineering, Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4273599/4273623/4273623-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Fei Teng (M'03) received the B.E. degree and M.

PTT is usually determined as the time interval between the peak of the electrocardiogram R wave and the foot of the photoplethysmogram (PPG). However, it was observed that the PPG is affected by the applied contact force between the photoplethysmographic sensor and the measurement site, e.g., finger. In this study, the nonlinear biomechanical properties of the finger arterial wall were considered when investigating the changes in PTT with varying contact force. Emphasis was placed on the changes in the shape of the arterial wall pressure-volume curve. The simulation results indicated that at positive transmural pressure, PTT increased with the applied contact force, reaching the maximum at zero transmural pressure and remaining at a constant level at negative transmural pressure. The theoretical analysis was further verified by the experiments carried out on thirty young subjects and six elderly subjects using twelve discrete levels of contact force.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.900815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.900815","startPage":"1490","endPage":"1498","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4273599/04273623.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical Study on the Effect of Sensor Contact Force on Pulse Transit Time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical Study on the Effect of Sensor Contact Force on Pulse Transit Time","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273623/","accessionNumber":"9609744","pubMedId":"17694870","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273623/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical Study on the Effect of Sensor Contact Force on Pulse Transit Time","sourcePdf":"54tbme08-teng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075089S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4273599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4273599","articleId":"4273623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":4273624,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Vaya","affiliation":["Department of Innovation in Bioengineering, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior de Cuenca, Castilla La Mancha University, Cuenca, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Vaya","id":"37393852000"},{"name":"Jos\u00c9 J.

In order to use the ECG as a tool for the analysis of AF, we need to separate the atrial activity (AA) from other cardioelectric signals. In this matter, statistical signal processing techniques, like blind source separation (BSS), are able to perform a multilead statistical analysis with the aim to obtain the AA. Linear BSS techniques can be divided in two groups depending on the mixing model: algorithms where instantaneous mixing of sources is assumed, and convolutive BSS (CBSS) algorithms. In this work, a comparison of performance between one relevant CBSS algorithm, namely Infomax, and one of the most effective independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms, namely FastICA, is developed. To carry out the study, pseudoreal AF ECGs have been synthesized by adding fibrillation activity to normal sinus rhythm. The algorithm performances are expressed by two indexes: the signal to interference ratio (SIR\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AA</sub>\n) and the cross-correlation (R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AA</sub>\n) between the original and the estimated AA.

The architecture is based on a hierarchical two-stage comparator structure and a dynamic MUX is used instead of a comparator in the second stage of the structure. By doing so, the fast dynamic MUX significantly improves the overall delay of the high-fan-in comparators. At the same time, a novel high-performance static priority encoder is proposed to generate the control signal for the MUX. A 64-bit MUX-based comparator has been built and compared with the existing fastest single-cycle design in the study by Lam and Tsui (2006). From both the post-layout simulation and test-chip measurement results, it is shown that the performance is improved by around 28%.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.899856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4273629/04273640.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.899856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">mux</emphasis>-based High-Performance Single-Cycle CMOS Comparator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">mux</emphasis>-based High-Performance Single-Cycle CMOS Comparator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","volume":"54","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273640/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9615959","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">mux</emphasis>-based High-Performance Single-Cycle CMOS Comparator","sourcePdf":"54tcsii07-lam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043328S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4273629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4273629","articleId":"4273640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":4273642,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrzad Jalali Mazlouman","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahrzad Jalali","lastName":"Mazlouman","id":"37399997900"},{"name":"Shahriar Mirabbasi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahriar","lastName":"Mirabbasi","id":"37269465100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4273642","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":502},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Wideband","Analog-digital conversion","Narrowband","Low pass filters","Digital filters","Parallel architectures","Array signal processing","Signal processing","Mixers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital filters","low-pass filters","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband analog-to-digital converters","parallel architecture","frequency translation","multi-rate signal processing","wideband continuous-time analog signal","narrowband quadrature signals","digital filters","reconstruction error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital conversion","multi-rate signal processing","parallel analog-to-digital converter (ADC) structure","wide-band"]}],"abstract":"A parallel architecture for high-bandwidth analog-to-digital conversion is presented. The proposed architecture uses frequency translation along with multi-rate signal processing to digitize a wide-band continuous-time analog signal through an array of identical narrowband analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The basic idea behind this structure is to decompose the input signal into smaller frequency (channels). Each channel is composed of a two-path system that includes mixers, identical low-pass filters and identical baseband ADCs. The signal in each two-path channel is sampled and digitized into narrowband quadrature signals. After digitizing the signal in each channel, the low-rate subband samples are upconverted back to their respective center frequencies, then filtered and combined to reconstruct the digital representation of the original wide-band input signal. The digital filters are designed to minimize the reconstruction error. The effects of some major nonidealities are discussed. Several simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the performance of the system.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.893734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4273629/04273642.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.893734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273629","startPage":"576","endPage":"580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Frequency-Translating Hybrid Architecture for Wide-Band Analog-to-Digital Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Frequency-Translating Hybrid Architecture for Wide-Band Analog-to-Digital Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9615960","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273642/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Frequency-Translating Hybrid Architecture for Wide-Band Analog-to-Digital Converters","sourcePdf":"54tcsii07-mazlouman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062839S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4273629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4273629","articleId":"4273642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273646,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We propose a novel reconstruction system where a finite-impulse response filter designed as differentiator followed by a time-varying multiplier recovers the uniformly spaced from the nonuniformly spaced samples. The system roughly doubles the signal-to-noise ratio with relatively few filter coefficients. The main advantage is that once the differentiator has been designed, it can be implemented with fixed multipliers, and only the coefficients of the time-varying multiplier have to be adapted when the sampling pattern changes; this reduces implementation costs substantially. In addition, the system allows an efficient polyphase implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of Two-Periodic Nonuniformly Sampled Band-Limited Signals Using a Discrete-Time Differentiator and a Time-Varying Multiplier","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.896801","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4273629/04273650.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.896801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of Two-Periodic Nonuniformly Sampled Band-Limited Signals Using a Discrete-Time Differentiator and a Time-Varying Multiplier","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4273650/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9605857","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of Two-Periodic Nonuniformly Sampled Band-Limited Signals Using a Discrete-Time Differentiator and a Time-Varying Multiplier","sourcePdf":"54tcsii07-tertinek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048667S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4273629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4273629","articleId":"4273650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273651,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279255300"},{"name":"Qingwei Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Qingwei","lastName":"Li","id":"37291118600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4273651","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Decoding","Turbo codes","Multiaccess communication","Very large scale integration","Delay","Computer architecture","Circuits","Computer science","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","code division multiple access","interleaved codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware interleaver","turbo decoding","wideband CDMA systems","computation complexity","VLSI architectures","turbo interleave pattern generation unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","interleaver","turbo codes","VLSI architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273651","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4273629/04273651.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.895313","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.895313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very Low-Complexity Hardware Interleaver for Turbo Decoding","abstract":"This brief presents a very low complexity hardware interleaver implementation for turbo code in wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) systems.

This paper considers a zero-current-switching (ZCS) current-source inverter (CSI) as a viable choice for many applications. It features low conduction and switching losses, inherent output filtering, capability of withstanding short circuits, and the opportunity to use thyristors. Despite these promising characteristics, this inverter exhibits a nonlinear relationship between the modulation index and the output current. Moreover, the resonant modes that are generated by the load-filter interaction must be damped. Since the previous aspects require a proper control law, a model of the system is very useful for defining and tuning a control structure. Thus, after providing a functional overview of the ZCS dc/ac CSI, this paper formulates a large-signal model and then derives and simplifies the averaged one. Numerical data are used to validate the models that are obtained. An active damping control for a motor drive is defined and tuned by means of the simplified averaged model, and its effectiveness is numerically validated.

This paper is focused on important issues concerning the development of such models and their subsequent use in designing control strategies for SRM drives. The main goal in modeling is to provide a good accuracy over the entire speed and torque range. To achieve this objective, the following requirements need to be met: 1) a good accuracy in matching the inductance of each stator phase; 2) inclusion of mutual effects when significant overlap among phases exists; 3) inclusion of short flux-path operation in each electrical cycle when significant overlap among adjacent phases exists; and 4) capability for autocalibration to cope with parameter variations incurred by manufacturing imperfections and operational conditions. In this paper, in addition to an in-depth discussion of the above factors, a practical modeling approach along with an autocalibration strategy is presented. A simple test collects the necessary data in developing the proposed model. Inherent separation among mechanical, electrical, and control time constants has been used to develop the autocalibration process. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04273659.pdf","startPage":"2165","endPage":"2173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.895118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.895118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autocalibrating Inductance Model for Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductance","Reluctance motors","Reluctance machines","Magnetic flux","Stators","Saturation magnetization","Magnetic analysis","Vehicle dynamics","Testing","Magnetic separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","inductance","machine control","optimal control","reluctance motor drives","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autocalibrating inductance model","switched reluctance motor drives","optimal control strategies","stator phase","mutual effects","short flux-path operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long flux path","mutual inductance","self-inductance","short flux path","switched reluctance machines (SRMs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Autocalibrating Inductance Model for Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273659/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9613174","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Autocalibrating Inductance Model for Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"54tie04-edrington.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111621S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4273659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273660,"authors":[{"name":"Feng-Chieh Lin","affiliation":["Research & Development Institute, TECO Electric and Machinery Company Limited, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4273660/4273660-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng-Chieh Lin received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He is currently a Research Engineer in the R&D Institute, TECO Electric & Machinery Company, Ltd., Taipei.

However, motor vibrations can be reduced with intentionally produced shaft radial force which cancels the existing unbalanced radial forces due to a nonuniform air gap or external load. Due to its special structure, the shaft radial force and torque of a switched reluctance motor (SRM) can be separately controlled when all pole currents are controlled independently. However, control of SRM radial force is rarely discussed in the existing literature. This paper presents a scheme that produces a controlled radial force for a 12/8-pole SRM. In this scheme, mutual inductances between stator poles are included in the control model. The motor torque is controlled with the conventional method, i.e., all poles in the conduction phase are energized with the same current to produce the desired torque. Two extra poles from the descending-inductance phase are energized to produce the desired radial force. The cross-coupling torque produced by the force producing poles is compensated. The experimental results have verified that when controlled with the proposed scheme, the SRM was able to produce a controlled radial force when at standstill or running, and subjected to a load torque.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach to Producing Controlled Radial Force in a Switched Reluctance Motor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.895129","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04273660.pdf","startPage":"2137","endPage":"2146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.895129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Approach to Producing Controlled Radial Force in a Switched Reluctance Motor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273660/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607789","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach to Producing Controlled Radial Force in a Switched Reluctance Motor","sourcePdf":"54tie04-fclin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051841S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4273660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273665,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4273665/4273665-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed was born in Cairo, Egypt, on November 25, 1977.

The robust controller is realized by including an adaptive element in the reference-voltage-generation stage using the feedforward control. Due to the time-varying nature and the high-bandwidth property of the uncertainties in a practical PMSM drive system, the adaptive element is simply chosen as the estimated uncertainty function, which adaptively varies with different operating conditions. Subsequently, the frequency modes of the uncertainty function are embedded in the control effort, and a robust current-control performance is yielded. Furthermore, the inclusion of the estimated uncertainty function provides an efficient solution for torque-ripple minimization in PMSM drives. This is because the frequency modes of the disturbances to be eliminated, i.e., the flux harmonics, are included in the stable closed-loop system. To provide a high-bandwidth estimate of the uncertainty function, a simple adaptation law is derived using the nominal current dynamics and the steepest descent method. To guarantee the system's convergence and to properly tune the proposed observer, a stability analysis based on a discrete-time Lyapunov function has been used. Comparative evaluation experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.895074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04273665.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.895074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","startPage":"1981","endPage":"1988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Robust Current-Control Scheme for a PMSM Vector Drive With a Simple Adaptive Disturbance Observer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Robust Current-Control Scheme for a PMSM Vector Drive With a Simple Adaptive Disturbance Observer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9619968","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273665/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Robust Current-Control Scheme for a PMSM Vector Drive With a Simple Adaptive Disturbance Observer","sourcePdf":"54tie04-mohamed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051418S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4273665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4273667,"authors":[{"name":"Micah Ortuzar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4273667/4273667-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Micah Ort\u00fazar (S'02\u2013M'04) received the degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently with the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile.

The system, which is composed of an ultracapacitor bank and a buck-boost converter, was installed in an EV, which is powered by a lead-acid battery pack and a 54-kW brushless dc motor. Two control strategies where developed: one based on heuristics and the other based on an optimization model using neural networks. These strategies were translated to algorithms and implemented in a digital signal processor, and their performance was evaluated in urban driving. The results were incorporated to an economic evaluation of the system, which shows that the reduction in costs would only justify the inclusion of this type of system in a lead-acid battery-powered vehicle if the battery life is extended by 50% or more, which is unlikely. The same results were extrapolated to a case in which the lead-acid batteries are replaced by a fuel cell. In this case, the costs of different power support systems were evaluated, such as ultracapacitors and high-specific-power lithium-based batteries. The results showed a significant cost reduction when AES configurations are included in contrast to a system powered by fuel cells only. Also, the cost reduction was higher when using ultracapacitors for this purpose.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273667/","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273667/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9606392","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultracapacitor-Based Auxiliary Energy System for an Electric Vehicle: Implementation and Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultracapacitor-Based Auxiliary Energy System for an Electric Vehicle: Implementation and Evaluation","sourcePdf":"54tie04-ortuzar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059386S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"362","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4273667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273668,"authors":[{"name":"Debiprasad Panda","affiliation":["Trans-Coil, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4273668/4273668-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Debiprasad Panda (M'00) was born in Doldere, India, in 1968.

The dc-bus voltage is controlled by incorporating a dc chopper between the three-phase line rectifier and a split dc-link capacitor-type four-switch power converter. Such controller reduces the acoustic noise, provides more accurate position estimation for sensorless operation, and improves the life expectancy of the motor. The algorithm is first simulated through MATLAB/SIMULINK and then tested on a four-phase 8/6-pole 4-kW SR motor. The test results of achieved acoustic noise and improved sensorless operation are presented. Through the proposed method, the acoustic noise is reduced by almost 15 dB compared to the conventional scheme at low-speed regime. The proposed method is intended to drive a fan type of load in HVAC applications, where the dynamic performance requirement is not a stringent criterion.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.895117","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04273668.pdf","startPage":"2065","endPage":"2078","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.895117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Acoustic Noise Variable DC-Bus-Voltage-Based Sensorless Switched Reluctance Motor Drive for HVAC Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Acoustic Noise Variable DC-Bus-Voltage-Based Sensorless Switched Reluctance Motor Drive for HVAC Applications","volume":"54","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616475","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273668/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Acoustic Noise Variable DC-Bus-Voltage-Based Sensorless Switched Reluctance Motor Drive for HVAC Applications","sourcePdf":"54tie04-panda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053741S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4273668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4273670,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Liang Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4273670/4273670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ji-Liang Shi was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1960.

In this paper, a novel rotor position/velocity estimation technique is proposed. This estimation technique only relates to the slopes of the stator currents and does not relate to the parameters or operating conditions of the motor. Neither an extra circuit nor an external high-frequency exciting signal is required here as compared to other position estimation techniques. In addition, the proposed estimator works well in transient, steady-state, and standstill conditions. As a result, the proposed method is very robust and useful. To improve the performance of the position-control system, an optimal controller is proposed. By using this controller, a fast transient response, good load disturbance rejection capability, and satisfactory tracking ability can be achieved. A digital signal processor, TMS-320-LF-2407, is used to execute the rotor position/velocity estimation, the current-loop control, the velocity-loop control, and the position-loop control. As a result, a fully digital position-control system is achieved. Several experimental results validate the theoretical analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04273670.pdf","startPage":"1989","endPage":"2000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.895137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.895137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position Control of an Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Without Using a Shaft Position Sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Position control","Synchronous motors","Shafts","Velocity control","Rotors","Stators","Circuits","Steady-state","Robustness","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","machine control","optimal control","permanent magnet motors","position control","rotors","shafts","stators","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor","shaft position sensor","sensorless position control system","rotor position-velocity estimation technique","stator currents","position estimation techniques","optimal controller","transient response","load disturbance rejection capability","digital signal processor","current-loop control","velocity-loop control","position-loop control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital signal processor (DSP)","interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM)","sensorless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Position Control of an Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Without Using a Shaft Position Sensor","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273670/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9607795","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position Control of an Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Without Using a Shaft Position Sensor","sourcePdf":"54tie04-shi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105668S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4273670","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273672,"authors":[{"name":"Durval de Almeida Souza","affiliation":["Federal Center for Technology Education of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4273672/4273672-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Durval de Almeida Souza was born in Salvador, Brazil, in 1970.

The technique combines two distinct control methods, namely, online search of the optimal operating point and a model-based efficiency control. For a given operating condition, which is characterized by a given speed and load torque, a search controller (SC); based on the \"Rosenbrock\" method) determines the flux level that results in the minimum input power. Once this optimal flux level has been found, this information is utilized to update the rule base of a fuzzy controller that plays the role of an implicit mathematical model of the system. Initially, for any load condition, the rule base yields the rated flux value. As the optimum points associated with the usual operating conditions (given by the required speeds and load torques) are identified by the SC, the rule base is progressively updated such that the fuzzy controller learns to model the optimal operating conditions for the entire torque-speed plane. As the machine parameters are subject to change during operation, the SC is kept active to track possible minor deviation of the optimum point, thus ensuring true optimal efficiency operation.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.895138","startPage":"2157","endPage":"2164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04273672.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.895138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for Efficiency Optimization of Induction Motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Fuzzy control","Induction motors","Optimal control","Torque control","Variable speed drives","Induction motor drives","Fuzzy systems","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","fuzzy control","induction motor drives","machine vector control","mathematical analysis","torque","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy controller","induction motors optimization","adjustable-speed drives","vector-controlled induction motor drives","model-based efficiency control","load torque","search controller","Rosenbrock method","mathematical model","torque-speed plane"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC motor drives","adaptive control","fuzzy control","optimization methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for Efficiency Optimization of Induction Motors","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273672/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9613176","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for Efficiency Optimization of Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"54tie04-souza.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066148S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4273672","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4273673,"authors":[{"name":"Oskar Wallmark","affiliation":["Swedish Center of Excellence in Electric Power Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4265775/4273673/4273673-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oskar Wallmark (S'01\u2013M'06) was born in Falun, Sweden, in 1976.

In addition, they help to envision the behavior of the space-time codes for the cases with more than one receiveing antennas. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4273676/04273677.pdf","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Bounds of Pairwise Error Probability for Space-Time Codes in Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273677/","displayDocTitle":"New Bounds of Pairwise Error Probability for Space-Time Codes in Rayleigh Fading Channels","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Bounds of Pairwise Error Probability for Space-Time Codes in Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"55tcomm07-abstracts-byun-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020677S","chronDate":"July  2007","isNumber":"4273676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4273677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4273684,"authors":[{"name":"Varghese Baby","affiliation":["Photonics Systems Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4273676/4273684/4273684-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Varghese Baby (S'02\u2013M'05) was born in Trivandrum, Kerala, India.

In this scheme, the basic MC-DS-CDMA system is augmented with a precoder and a multicode encoder at the transmitter. The multicode encoder is an inverse Walsh-Hadamard transform (IWHT) unit, while the precoder is a recently suggested ldquoconstant amplituderdquo encoder that guarantees that the IWHT output stream has binary level. While IWHT, multicarrier (MC) transmission, and direct sequence spreading provide us with frequency diversity, the constant amplitude precoder ensures that the transmitted waveform is spread BPSK signal, minimizing peak to average-power ratio (PAPR) problem. The multicode and (MC) combination also addresses the need for flexible high data rate services in present day wireless communications. In the receiver, after matched filtering or correlation demodulation for each subcarrier and WHT operation, a detection strategy based on minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion is used. We have derived an upper bound for the bit error rate (BER) performance in Nakagami fading channel. Numerical results are compared with those obtained from a single carrier DS-CDMA system (SC-DS-CDMA) and a MC-DS-CDMA scheme without the precoding and IWHT units. We show that our proposed MC-DS-CDMA scheme has a much better BER performance compared with both of these schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4273676/04273685.pdf","startPage":"1363","endPage":"1373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a New Premulticoded Multicarrier DS-CDMA System in Nakagami Fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Fading","Bit error rate","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Transmitters","Frequency diversity","Binary phase shift keying","Peak to average power ratio","Wireless communication","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","Hadamard codes","least mean squares methods","matched filters","Nakagami channels","precoding","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["premulticoded multicarrier DS-CDMA system","Nakagami fading channel","direct sequence code division multiple access","MC-DS-CDMA system","Walsh-Hadamard transform unit","precoder","encoder","multicarrier transmission","direct sequence spreading","BPSK signal","peak to average-power ratio","wireless communications","matched filtering","correlation demodulation","minimum-mean-square-error criterion","bit error rate","BER","SC-DS-CDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DS-CDMA","MMSE detection","multicarrier CDMA","multicode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a New Premulticoded Multicarrier DS-CDMA System in Nakagami Fading","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4273685/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9977824","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a New Premulticoded Multicarrier DS-CDMA System in Nakagami Fading","sourcePdf":"55tcomm07-cao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078906S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4273676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4273676","articleId":"4273685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4273690,"authors":[{"name":"Xinmin Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4273676/4273690/4273690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinmin Deng (S'01\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, in 2005.","From 2001 to 2005, he was a Research Assistant in the Center for Communications and Signal Processing Research, New Jersey Institute of Technology.

Our analysis is independent of the OCDMA implementation or spreading code. In conventional networks, e.g., a wavelength-routed network (WRN), new circuits are blocked when all wavelengths are occupied. In OCDMA when the number of codewords exceeds number of network subscribers, new circuits need not be blocked. Instead, capacity is limited by multiple access interference: when the number of actively transmitting circuits becomes excessive, the bit-error rate (BER) of all circuits on the network degrades, causing an outage. We find that through statistical multiplexing, the capacity of OCDMA exceeds that of a WRN except when circuit activity is very high while the constraints on outages are more stringent than those on blocking. In such cases, we show how OCDMA with call admission control can be used to match or exceed the capacity of a WRN. Overall, our analysis shows that OCDMA is well suited to applications when conventional blocking is undesirable, and/or circuits carry bursty traffic.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Circuits","Bit error rate","Optical fiber networks","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Multiple access interference","Degradation","Interference constraints","Call admission control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","error statistics","interference (signal)","optical fibre networks","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["teletraffic capacity","optical CDMA","optical code division multiple access network","circuit-switched OCDMA network","wavelength-routed network","multiple access interference","bit error rate","statistical multiplexing","call admission control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multi-access (CDMA)","optical communication","queueing analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273692","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900616","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4273676/04273692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900616","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Teletraffic Capacity of Optical CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Teletraffic Capacity of Optical CDMA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273692/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4273692/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9977828","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Teletraffic Capacity of Optical CDMA","sourcePdf":"55tcomm07-goldberg.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068009S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4273676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4273676","articleId":"4273692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4273694,"authors":[{"name":"Shaw Wei Kok","affiliation":["Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shaw Wei","lastName":"Kok","id":"37282425000"},{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279962500"},{"name":"Changyun Wen","affiliation":["Center for Modeling and Control of Complex Systems, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Changyun","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280264000"},{"name":"Yeng Chai Soh","affiliation":["Center for Modeling and Control of Complex Systems, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yeng Chai","lastName":"Soh","id":"38182320200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4273694","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Optical detectors","Optical noise","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Optical fiber communication","Interference","Gunshot detection systems","Bandwidth","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","correlation methods","error statistics","maximum likelihood estimation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["likelihood ratio","MAP correlation detection","OCDMA communication","optimal correlation detection","optical code division multiple-access","monotonicity property","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chip-level detection","likelihood ratio","optimal detection","optical CDMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the monotonicity of the likelihood ratio used in the optimal correlation detection is established for optical code division multiple-access (OCDMA).

Such an inference and estimation problem is encountered, for e.g., in adaptive turbo equalization/demodulation where soft information about the transmitted data symbols has to be inferred in the presence of the channel uncertainty, given the received signal samples and a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">priori</i>\n information provided by the decoder.

In this paper, we show how many of the well-known low-complexity soft-input soft-output (SISO) equalizers, including the channel-matched filter-based linear SISO equalizers and minimum mean square error (MMSE) SISO equalizers, as well as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm-based SISO demodulators in the presence of the Rayleigh fading channel, can be formulated as solutions to a variational optimization problem. The variational optimization is a well-established methodology for low-complexity inference and estimation, originating from statistical physics. Importantly, the imposed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">variational</i>\n optimization framework provides an interesting link between the APP demodulators and the linear SISO equalizers. Moreover, it provides a new set of insights into the structure and performance of these widely celebrated linear SISO equalizers while suggesting their fine tuning as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273696/","accessionNumber":"9977831","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Input Soft-Output Equalizers for Turbo Receivers: A Statistical Physics Perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Input Soft-Output Equalizers for Turbo Receivers: A Statistical Physics Perspective","sourcePdf":"55tcomm07-nissila.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068118S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4273676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4273676","articleId":"4273696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4273697,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Perrins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4273676/4273697/4273697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erik Perrins (S'96-M'05-SM'06) received the B.S.

The complexity savings result from viewing the signal as a continuous-phase modulation (CPM). We give a simple and convenient closed-form expression for a recursive binary-to-ternary precoder for SOQPSK. The recursive nature of this formulation is necessary in serially concatenated systems where SOQPSK serves as the inner code. We show that the proposed detectors are optimal in the full-response case, and are near-optimal in the partial-response case due to some additional complexity reducing approximations. In all cases, the proposed detectors achieve large coding gains for serially concatenated coded SOQPSK. These gains are similar to those reported recently by Li and Simon, which were obtained using a more complicated cross-correlated trellis-coded quadrature modulation (XTCQM) interpretation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4273676/04273697.pdf","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Approach to Iterative Detection of Coded SOQPSK","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Pulse modulation","Pulse amplifiers","Phase modulation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Phase detection","Concatenated codes","Detectors","Pulse shaping methods","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous phase modulation","iterative methods","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-complexity approach","iterative detection","coded SOQPSK","shaped-offset quadrature phase-shift keying","bandwidth-efficient modulation","constant-envelope modulation","continuous-phase modulation","closed-form expression","recursive binary-to-ternary precoder","serially concatenated systems","coding gains","cross-correlated trellis-coded quadrature modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous phase modulation (CPM)","iterative detection","reduced complexity","shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK)","soft-input soft-output"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Approach to Iterative Detection of Coded SOQPSK","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4273697/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9977832","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Approach to Iterative Detection of Coded SOQPSK","sourcePdf":"55tcomm07-perrins.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204058S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4273676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4273676","articleId":"4273697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273700,"authors":[{"name":"Anshul Tyagi","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Anshul","lastName":"Tyagi","id":"37418075000"},{"name":"Ranjan Bose","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ranjan","lastName":"Bose","id":"37276591500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4273700","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","MIMO","Pulse modulation","Receiving antennas","Amplitude modulation","Fading","Delay","Ultra wideband technology","Multipath channels","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","pulse amplitude modulation","space-time codes","trellis codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time trellis codes","UWB MIMO Communications","pulse position amplitude modulation","ultrawideband multiple-input multiple-output systems","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","multipath channels","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","trellis codes"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a new distance notion and develop novel design criteria for optimal MN-ary pulse position amplitude modulation (PPAM) space-time trellis codes (STTC) for ultrawideband multiple-input multiple-output systems for slow and fast fading at both low and high SNR.

The proposed method is a heuristic algorithm that eliminates a large number of pseudocodewords that can cause nonconvergence in the BP decoder. The augmented decoder is a multistage iterative decoder, where, at each stage, the original channel messages on select symbol nodes are replaced by saturated messages. The key element of the proposed method is the symbol selection process, which is based on the appropriately defined subgraphs of the code graph and/or the reliability of the information received from the channel. We demonstrate by examples that this decoder can be implemented to achieve substantial gains (compared to the standard locally-operating BP decoder) for short LDPC codes decoded on both memoryless and intersymbol interference Gaussian channels. Using the Margulis code example, we also show that the augmented decoder reduces the error floors. Finally, we discuss types of BP decoding errors and relate them to the augmented BP decoder.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900611","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4273676/04273701.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmented Belief Propagation Decoding of Low-Density Parity Check Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Belief Propagation Decoding of Low-Density Parity Check Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273701/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9977836","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273701/","volume":"55","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented Belief Propagation Decoding of Low-Density Parity Check Codes","sourcePdf":"55tcomm07-varnica.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132978S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4273676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4273676","articleId":"4273701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4273702,"authors":[{"name":"Tairan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4273676/4273702/4273702-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tairan Wang (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2003.

For the practically attractive decode-and-forward (DF) relay strategy, we derive a high-performance low-complexity coherent demodulator at the destination in the form of a weighted combiner. The weights are selected adaptively to account for the quality of both source-relay-destination and source-destination links. Analysis proves that the novel coherent demodulator can achieve the maximum possible diversity, regardless of the underlying constellation. Its error performance tightly bounds that of maximum-likelihood (ML) demodulation, which provably quantifies the diversity gain of ML detection with DF relaying. Simulations corroborate the analysis and compare the performance of the novel decoder with existing diversity-achieving strategies including analog amplify-and-forward and selective-relaying.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4273676/04273702.pdf","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.900631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Cooperative Demodulation With Decode-and-Forward Relays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Digital relays","Maximum likelihood decoding","Diversity methods","Performance analysis","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Strontium","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative demodulation","decode-and-forward relays","source-relay-destination","source-destination links","maximum-likelihood demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity gain","decode-and-forward (DF)","full diversity","relay channel","relaying protocol","user cooperation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Cooperative Demodulation With Decode-and-Forward Relays","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4273702/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9977837","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Cooperative Demodulation With Decode-and-Forward Relays","sourcePdf":"55tcomm07-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077157S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4273676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"519","xplore-issue":"4273676","articleId":"4273702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273703,"authors":[{"name":"Jianming Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4273676/4273703/4273703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianming Wu (S'03) received the B.E. degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1999, the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2006, all in electrical engineering.","She is currently with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Pittsburgh.

An experimental setup has been arranged in order to validate the proposed simulation tool. To this aim, the features of a semi-anechoic EM chamber have been exploited in order to operate in a shielded test site for the measurement of near-field radiated emissions. Two different 3-D geometrical configurations of realistic vehicle installations of the loads are studied. A comparative analysis among measured and computed results is performed. A good agreement between simulated and measured data is obtained. The proposed approach is suitable for the prediction of radiated EM interference generated by dc/dc converters and, particularly, by dual-voltage vehicle electric plants. In fact, due to the presence of complicated layout, the prediction of EM emissions can be a useful task in order to evaluate the EM compatibility (EMC) compliance from the design stage. Furthermore, with the growing market penetration of the ldquomore electric vehiclerdquo (MEV) concept in designing new vehicle electrical architectures, low-cost test methods for EMC assessments and suitable technical standard requirements have to be introduced. The proposed simulation tool can be usefully adopted to this aim. As an important advantage, it requires only a current measurement in the time domain. Such measurement does not need the use of a special test site or of a radiated field measurement setup.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Radiated EMI in 42-V Vehicle Electrical Systems by FDTD Simulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.896964","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4273706/04273707.pdf","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.896964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Radiated EMI in 42-V Vehicle Electrical Systems by FDTD Simulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273707/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607564","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Radiated EMI in 42-V Vehicle Electrical Systems by FDTD Simulation","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-ala-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073275S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4273706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4273706","articleId":"4273707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4273708,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Baldini Filho","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Faculty of Electrical and Computing Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4273706/4273708/4273708-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renato Baldini Filho received the Electrical Engineering and M.Sc. degrees from Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil, in 1980 and 1983, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., in 1992.","In 1984, he was with the Faculty of Electrical and Computing Engineering (FEEC), State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where he is currently Associate Professor.

Optimal design rules for distributed space-time codes (STCs) are derived through the investigation of pairwise error probability expression for each considered protocol. The derived design rules reveal a Euclidean-distance-type performance metric, including some scaling terms due to the effects of AF operation mode and cooperation protocols as well as path loss/shadowing effects associated with the underlying relay links. Based on the derived criteria, an exhaustive computer code search is conducted to find out optimal distributed STCs. Our search results indicate the optimality of conventional designs, i.e., based on classical Euclidean distance, for relay numbers larger than two in a distributed scenario.

After applying the discrete-Fourier-transform operation to the output of each antenna, one estimates the signal-plus-interference spatial correlation matrix by selecting the samples at ldquononzero-valuedrdquo subcarriers and the interference-alone spatial correlation matrix by choosing those samples at ldquozero-valuedrdquo subcarriers (also known as virtual carriers). The beamforming weight vector is the ldquolargestrdquo generalized eigenvector of the resulting matrix pencil, wherein the solution is computed in a batch fashion. By using a limited number of samples, the proposed scheme offers competitive performance compared with that of the scheme using optimal beamforming weight vectors that are calculated for each subcarrier under small-angular-spread scenarios. The adaptive solution for calculating the beamforming weight vector is also derived. The proposed schemes are shown to be suitable in scenarios of narrow angular spread with exponential power delay profile. The simulations that are presented here employ the OFDM signal model to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4273706/04273712.pdf","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Antenna Arrays for Interference Cancellation in OFDM Communication Systems With Virtual Carriers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Antenna arrays","Interference cancellation","OFDM","Array signal processing","Frequency division multiplexing","Delay","Wireless LAN","Channel estimation","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interference suppression","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","interference cancellation","OFDM communication systems","virtual carriers","adaptive beamforming schemes","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","discrete Fourier transform","signal-plus-interference","spatial correlation matrix","zero-valued subcarriers","generalized eigenvector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive beamforming","antenna arrays","interference cancellation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Antenna Arrays for Interference Cancellation in OFDM Communication Systems With Virtual Carriers","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273712/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606679","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Antenna Arrays for Interference Cancellation in OFDM Communication Systems With Virtual Carriers","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-chen-cr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062907S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4273706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4273706","articleId":"4273712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4273716,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Dianati","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4273706/4273716/4273716-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehrdad Dianati (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1992 and K.N.Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, in 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2006.","From 1995 to 1997, he was a Lecturer with Aerospace University, Tehran.

The base station assigns multiple beamforming weights for transmission in the signal subspace, and the mobile combines signals from multiple dimensions to preserve the received signal strength against fast channel fading.

The scheme is compatible with quadratic-amplitude modulation and with both parallel concatenated convolutional and low-density parity checks coding.

The correlation is caused by the mutual interaction of the scattering environment and antenna elements. To study the effect of antenna directivity and orientations on the correlation and channel capacity in a more realistic environment, we extend the ldquoone-ringrdquo model to a spherical scattering environment, which is appropriate for narrowband 3D Rayleigh fading. In our model, scatterers around a subscriber unit are distributed over a sphere centered on the antenna array in the subscriber unit. Antenna directivity is included in a precise way, and the antenna array can be placed in any orientation. Any type of antenna can be studied in the model. Through simulation, we find that directive antenna elements in linear broadside arrays make the channel capacity more strongly directive than when antenna elements are isotropic. Moreover, different antenna patterns and orientations have different outage capacities depending on the interaction of antenna directivities and the incident waves, which shows that the antenna pattern and orientation affect the channel capacity to some extent. In the uniformly scatter-rich environment, the microstrip antenna array can have 10% higher outage capacity than that of the dipole antenna array.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.895500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4273706/04273721.pdf","startPage":"1591","endPage":"1599","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.895500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Antenna Physics on Fading Correlation and the Capacity of Multielement Antenna Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Antenna Physics on Fading Correlation and the Capacity of Multielement Antenna Systems","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273721/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607567","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Antenna Physics on Fading Correlation and the Capacity of Multielement Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-gong-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075541S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4273706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4273706","articleId":"4273721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4273730,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4273706/4273730/4273730-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang-Hui Li received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2000 and 2002, respectively.","He is currently a Research Engineer at Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.

A design example of DCR RF parameters planning for a 5-GHz 802.11a WLAN is presented and discussed. It is found that the critical specifications to realize a 5-GHz 802.11a WLAN DCR are the local-oscillator phase noise and I/Q imbalance. However, since there is a 312.5-kHz empty region around zero frequency for the 802.11a standard, dc offset and flicker noise are less sensitive. Hence, the DCR architecture is still an attractive choice for the 802.11a WLAN system.

The idea is to replace the regular dc-link capacitors with ultracapacitors in order to combine the energy storage unit and motor drive. This approach eliminates the need for an interfacing dc-dc converter and considerably improves the efficiency of regenerative braking energy restoration in large vehicles using multilevel converters. Utilizing the proposed modulation control set, the two cascaded inverters can have their dc voltage levels maintained at any ratio (even a noninteger ratio) or dynamically varied over a wide range without disrupting the normal operation of the electric motor. As an advantage, ultracapacitor voltage or state of charge can be freely controlled for braking and/or acceleration power management. A regenerative energy management scheme is also proposed based on the vehicle's speed range considerations.

However, OCHM may yield a worse bit error rate (BER) performance than the conventional CDMA systems due to code collisions. Therefore, a synergy/perforation operation, which is a control scheme for mapping code-colliding modulation symbols to specific constellation points on the - plane, is needed to compensate for BER degradation, and this synergy/perforation operation should be defined separately with modulation types. Previously, synergy/perforation control schemes for quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) have been proposed, but there has been no study of 16-quadratic-amplitude modulation (16-QAM) in OCHM. We propose two synergy/perforation control schemes for 16-QAM in OCHM and a log-likelihood ratio conversion scheme for 16-QAM in OCHM. The proposed control schemes are evaluated by an analytical approach and simulations and are compared to the previous scheme for QPSK modulation. We show that the proposed control scheme has a performance similar to that of QPSK modulation in terms of the mean synergy ratio for code-colliding modulation symbols and additional required .","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.895594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4273706/04273741.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.895594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273706","startPage":"1704","endPage":"1715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synergy/Perforation Control for 16-QAM in Orthogonal Code Hopping Multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synergy/Perforation Control for 16-QAM in Orthogonal Code Hopping Multiplexing","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9605853","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273741/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synergy/Perforation Control for 16-QAM in Orthogonal Code Hopping Multiplexing","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-moon-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127998S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4273706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"4273706","articleId":"4273741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4273742,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Mucchi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4273706/4273742/4273742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lorenzo Mucchi (S'99\u2013A'01\u2013M'03) was born in Rome, Italy, in 1971.

Unfortunately, the space- time transmit diversity (STTD) needs the channel knowledge at the receiver, and thus, errors in the estimation process at the receiver can drastically reduce the diversity gain. This paper deals with the development of two new schemes of space-time MMSE receivers implemented for the forward link of a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) multisatellite system and their performance evaluation under nonideal conditions. The aim of this paper is to show that the schemes proposed are able to better mitigate multiple access interference, that they show robustness against an imperfect knowledge of the channel state, and that they do not need a synchronization of the symbols transmitted by the satellites in order to let STTD technique work properly. A comparison with other two space-time MMSE detectors which have already been dealt with in the literature is also included. The detectors are compared by means of the simulation of a realistic multisatellite WCDMA environment. Bit error rates are calculated by means of Monte Carlo simulations, assuming a time-varying satellite channel model. The results show that the receivers proposed in this paper outperform the detectors presented in the literature in the vehicular channel, i.e., when the receiver has a high mobility, although a 30deg of channel phase coefficient estimation error is present.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Multiaccess communication","3G mobile communication","Estimation error","Transmitters","Fading","Wireless communication","Downlink","Artificial satellites","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","least mean squares methods","Monte Carlo methods","radio receivers","satellite communication","space-time adaptive processing","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel phase coefficient estimation error","vehicular channel","time-varying satellite channel model","Monte Carlo simulations","bit error rates","STTD technique","multiple access interference","performance evaluation","WCDMA system","wideband code division multiple access system","space-time MMSE receivers","nonideal conditions","multisatellite systems","space-time MMSE detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","MMSE detectors","multisatellite","space\u2013time transmit diversity (STTD)","WCDMA"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.895487","startPage":"1716","endPage":"1726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4273706/04273742.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.895487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space\u2013Time MMSE Advanced Detector for Multisatellite Systems Under Nonideal Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Space\u2013Time MMSE Advanced Detector for Multisatellite Systems Under Nonideal Conditions","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9605854","publicationDate":"July 2007","volume":"56","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273742/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space\u2013Time MMSE Advanced Detector for Multisatellite Systems Under Nonideal Conditions","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-mucchi-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094759S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4273706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"4273706","articleId":"4273742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4273745,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The employment of adaptive modulation techniques in conjunction with AAAs resulted in further significant network capacity gains.

In order to achieve maximum torque per ampere (MTPA), knowledge of the motor parameters is necessary. Due to the high ambient temperature inside the engine cavity as well as the saturation effect, variation of motor parameters such as inductances and permanent magnet (PM) flux density is not avoidable. Offline models for estimating the motor parameters are known as a computationally intensive method, particularly, when the effect of cross saturation and PM flux deterioration are included. In this paper, a practical MTPA control scheme, along with a simple parameter estimator for the PMa SynRM, is introduced. This method is capable of maintaining the MTPA condition and stays robust against motor parameter variations. To verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed controller, several simulations and experiments results on a low-power laboratory prototype PMa SynRM have been presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA) Control of PM-Assisted SynRM for Traction Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.896974","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4273706/04273746.pdf","startPage":"1538","endPage":"1545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.896974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA) Control of PM-Assisted SynRM for Traction Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4273746/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607570","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA) Control of PM-Assisted SynRM for Traction Applications","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-niazi-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064527S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4273706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4273706","articleId":"4273746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273747,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Parsa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4273706/4273747/4273747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leila Parsa (S'00\u2013M'05) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2005.","She is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.

Therefore, it is essential that both the traction motor and the associated drive operate at their optimal efficiencies throughout the driving schedule. In typical HEV propulsion applications, the traction motor and the drive are used over the entire torque/speed operational range. In view of this fact, this paper aims at modeling the inverter and motor losses/efficiencies over typical city and highway driving schedules. The noteworthy losses within a typical three-phase dc/ac traction inverter, such as the switching and conduction losses for both the insulated-gate bipolar transistors and the antiparallel diodes, are modeled and simulated over the city and highway driving patterns. An induction motor (IM) is used for a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, which was modeled in the advanced vehicle simulator (ADVISOR) software. The significant IM losses that were considered in the study include the stator copper losses, rotor copper losses, and core losses. Thus, the average efficiencies of both the inverter drive and the induction traction motor are evaluated and summarized under city as well as highway driving conditions. Finally, based on the individual-model-based efficiency analysis, the overall traction motor drive system efficiency is estimated.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.896967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4273706/04273755.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.896967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273706","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Efficiency Modeling of Electric Traction Motor Drives for Hybrid Electric Vehicle Propulsion Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Efficiency Modeling of Electric Traction Motor Drives for Hybrid Electric Vehicle Propulsion Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273755/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616269","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273755/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Efficiency Modeling of Electric Traction Motor Drives for Hybrid Electric Vehicle Propulsion Applications","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-williamson-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111158S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4273706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"4273706","articleId":"4273755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273756,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441000"},{"name":"Ming Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Kang","id":"37271700700"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4273756","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":741},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Spread spectrum communication","Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Code division multiplexing","Autocorrelation","Electrons","Digital communication","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","multiuser channels","resource allocation","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity-fairness tradeoff","system resource scheduling","wireless channel","proportional fair scheduling","multiuser diversity system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","degree of fairness","fading channels","multiuser selection diversity","scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Conventional multiuser diversity maximizes the system throughput but results in an unfair scheduling of the system resources across users.

It explicitly recognizes future decisions, and the exercise strategy is based on the optimal decisions in future periods. The real options approach has been applied to many economic and financial problems, but few are in computer science and engineering. The novelty of this work lies in applying real options to a computational problem. This paper proposes using the real options technique to find an optimal stopping decision for the compact genetic algorithm. The compact genetic algorithm, a kind of genetic algorithms, represents the population as a probability distribution over a set of solutions. This distribution automatically captures the underlying uncertainty of the problem, which can be simulated to obtain an evolutionary process of the algorithm. The experiments show preliminary results of employing the real options approach to determine the optimal stopping time for the compact genetic algorithm. The proposed technique can be applied to analyze other machine-learning algorithms, such as neural networks or other variations of genetic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384385","startPage":"215","endPage":"220","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273788","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273788/04273832.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real Options Approach to Finding Optimal Stopping Time in Compact Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273832/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real Options Approach to Finding Optimal Stopping Time in Compact Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4273832/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9772705","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real Options Approach to Finding Optimal Stopping Time in Compact Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-1-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043354S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4273788","articleId":"4273832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4273856,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Sumiya","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Sumiya","id":"37846791700"},{"name":"Kenji Fujihira","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Fujihira","id":"37553228100"},{"name":"Shunsuke Kamijo","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Kamijo","id":"37326477000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4273856","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273856","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Sensor fusion","Event detection","Sensor systems","Vehicle detection","Traffic control","Image recognition","Cameras","Vehicles","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","image recognition","image sensors","sensor fusion","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic hierarchy fusion","image sensors","supersonic wave sensors","incident detection","image recognition methods","event detection system","surveillance system","sensor fusion technique"]}],"abstract":"Recently, a lot of image sensors are employed for the purpose of incident detection, because image sensors can provide much more rich information than spot sensors such as supersonic wave sensors. However, it is quite difficult to achieve high accuracy by image recognition methods because of their instability against environmental changes. On the other hand, for example, supersonic wave sensors have advantages on robustness against environmental changes, and it requires less CPU performance than image sensors. Therefore, future event detection system should collaborate different sensors in order to realize a totally efficient surveillance system. In this paper, we developed algorithms for incident detection by sensor fusion technique among the two different sensors. The algorithm was evaluated by using 3 month data of images and supersonic waves on expressway in Tokyo containing about 20 incidents. And the algorithm was then proved to be more accurate than the algorithm using a single video image which we previously developed for incident detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384409","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273788/04273856.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273788","endPage":"369","startPage":"364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Hierarchy Fusion of Image Sensors and Supersonic wave Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273856/","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Hierarchy Fusion of Image Sensors and Supersonic wave Sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4273856/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9772592","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Hierarchy Fusion of Image Sensors and Supersonic wave Sensors","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-1-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045513S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","xplore-issue":"4273788","articleId":"4273856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4273880,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Lin Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Lin","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37589352500"},{"name":"I-Ju Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Ju","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37683912900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4273880","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copyright protection","Satellites","Cryptography","Wavelet transforms","Watermarking","Image generation","Image retrieval","Clouds","Image sampling","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","image retrieval","image sampling","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright protection","weather satellite images","share image generation phase","watermark retrieval phase","gray-level slicing","feature extraction","sampling plane image","discrete wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers weather satellite images as the protected host images and proposes a novel copyright protection scheme according to the property of the images. The scheme contains two phases: the share image generation phase and the watermark retrieval phase. In the generation phase, the proposed scheme first generates a cloud image from the host image using gray-level slicing and creates a special sampling plane image from the cloud image and the host image. Next, the scheme extracts the features from the sampling plane image using the discrete wavelet transform. Then, the scheme employs the features and the watermark to generate a principal share image. In the retrieval phase, an expanded watermark is first reconstructed using the features of the suspect image and the principal share image. Next, the scheme reduces the additional noise to obtain the recovered watermark, which is then verified against the original watermark to examine the copyright. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can resist several attacks such as JPEG compression, blurring, sharpening, scaling, and cropping.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384433","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273788/04273880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273788","startPage":"501","endPage":"506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Copyright Protection Scheme for Satellite Images Using Secret Sharing and Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Copyright Protection Scheme for Satellite Images Using Secret Sharing and Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273880/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772425","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273880/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Copyright Protection Scheme for Satellite Images Using Secret Sharing and Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-1-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074296S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4273788","articleId":"4273880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4273890,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Yu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan-Yu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37402709200"},{"name":"Da-Feng Zhuang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Da-Feng","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37926825200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4273890","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Vector quantization","Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Neoplasms","Magnetic resonance","Magnetic resonance imaging","Magnetic materials","Mathematical model","Lesions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","patient diagnosis","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent nasal papilloma detection","fuzzy algorithm learning vector quantization neural network","Gadolinium-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance image","MRI","clinical diagnosis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273890","abstract":"The objective of this paper is to develop a complete solution for recurrent nasal papilloma (RNP) detection. Recently, the gadolinium-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance image (MRI) has been developed and widely used in clinical diagnosis of recurrent nasal papilloma. Owing to the response of RNP regions in gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images is different from the response of normal tissues, the difference between the dynamic-MR images before and after administering contrast material can be used to extract the coarse RNP regions automatically. Then, a fuzzy algorithm for learning vector quantization (FALVQ) neural network is used to pick the suspicious RNP regions. Finally, a feature-based region growing method is applied to recover the complete RNP regions. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect RNP regions automatically, correctly and fast.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384443","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273788/04273890.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"561","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Nasal Papilloma Detection Using a Fuzzy Algorithm Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Nasal Papilloma Detection Using a Fuzzy Algorithm Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9772362","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4273890/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Nasal Papilloma Detection Using a Fuzzy Algorithm Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-1-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042026S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","xplore-issue":"4273788","articleId":"4273890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4273975,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Huang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineer, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Huang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37351053600"},{"name":"Ching-Chih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineer, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37291087300"},{"name":"Yuan-Hai Charng","affiliation":["Department of Machine Engineer, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hai","lastName":"Charng","id":"37601185600"},{"name":"Chi-Ming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineer, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600003800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4273975","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"abstract":"This paper presents MIMO predictive control using recurrent neural networks for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems.

In this paper, we report on the analysis for the movement characteristics (distance, bearing, velocity, course) and sound source frequency by elimination Doppler effect from sounds radiated by the propulsion system of an unknown object in sea. To analyze those data, we applied two kinds of GA. One of them analyzes harmonic frequencies and their phases of the Doppler effected sound signals.

Mathematically, it considers the problem of partitioning a set of elements (or objects) into mutually exclusive classes (or groups), where elements which are \"similar\" to each other are, hopefully, located in the same class. This problem has been shown to be NP-Hard, and the literature reports solutions in which the similarity constraint consists of a single index. For example, typical \"similarity\" conditions that have been used in the literature include those in which \"similar\" objects are accessed together (as in the context of query systems), or when they communicate (as processes do) with each other. The application at hand is the static mapping problem (SMP) of distributing the processes of a parallel application onto a set of computing nodes. Such an application may run on multiple GRID sites where it is desirable avoid centralised control and mapping. This paper proposes a solution to this combinatorial optimization problem resulting from the collective behaviour of independent Discrete General Pursuit Automata (DGPA) that tries to learn the digraph of the communication among the processes of the application, and group together processes with strong mutual dependencies. Earlier learning solutions to the problem were either based on centralised mapping with full system knowledge. In this paper, we attempt to relax this assumptions, thus rendering the problem more complex. The present solution performs very well when the system size is small. However, the simulated results demonstrate that the quality of the final solution decreases with the number of elements. Thus, although this is the first reported solution to the problem which incorporates the specific digraph properties of the objects, the scalability of the solution to the problem which incorporates the specific digraph properties of the objects, the scalability of the solution remains open.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384537","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273954/04273985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273954","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Application of a Game of Discrete Generalised Pursuit Automata to Solve a Multi-Constraint Partitioning Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Application of a Game of Discrete Generalised Pursuit Automata to Solve a Multi-Constraint Partitioning Problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273985/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772498","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4273985/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Application of a Game of Discrete Generalised Pursuit Automata to Solve a Multi-Constraint Partitioning Problem","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-2-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05143S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4273954","articleId":"4273985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273988,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Graduate institute of Learning Technology, National Hualien University of Education, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406734100"},{"name":"Chao-Yu Liu","affiliation":["Graduate institute of Learning Technology, National Hualien University of Education, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37716480800"},{"name":"Wei-Chia Chiu","affiliation":["Graduate institute of Learning Technology, National Hualien University of Education, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Chia","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37942484100"},{"name":"Tai-Hung Lee","affiliation":["Graduate institute of Learning Technology, National Hualien University of Education, Hualien, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tai-Hung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37932465000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4273988","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Educational technology","Chaos","Web sites","Information retrieval","Cybernetics","Investments","Decision making","Information analysis","Modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information resources","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personalized e-news monitoring agent system","news events tracking","user-interested Chinese news events","topic tracking","Chinese word segmentation system","ECScanner"]}],"abstract":"The study presents a personalized e-news monitoring agent system which employs the topic tracking based approach for tracking the user-interested news events.

However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely \"attack signature\", resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper we propose an intrusion detection method that proposes rough set based feature selection heuristics and using fuzzy ants for clustering data. Rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy. Fuzzy ants clustering methods allow objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership. Our approach allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack The experimental results on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining-(KDDCup 1999) dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384543","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273954/04273991.pdf","startPage":"1079","endPage":"1084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Learning: A Fusion of Rough Sets and Fuzzy Ants Clustering for Anomaly Detection System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4273991/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Learning: A Fusion of Rough Sets and Fuzzy Ants Clustering for Anomaly Detection System","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772226","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4273991/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Learning: A Fusion of Rough Sets and Fuzzy Ants Clustering for Anomaly Detection System","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-2-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05262S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","xplore-issue":"4273954","articleId":"4273991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4273995,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Nan Ko","affiliation":["Automation Engineering Department, Nankai Institute of Technology, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Nan","lastName":"Ko","id":"37656158000"},{"name":"Tsong-Li Lee","affiliation":["Automation Engineering Department, Nankai Institute of Technology, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsong-Li","lastName":"Lee","id":"37420373700"},{"name":"Yu-Yi Fu","affiliation":["Automation Engineering Department, Nankai Institute of Technology, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Yi","lastName":"Fu","id":"37890934900"},{"name":"Chia-Ju Wu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Ju","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402220100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4273995","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4273995","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy logic","Biological cells","Space technology","Design engineering","Algorithm design and analysis","Design methodology","Automation","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control rule","genetic algorithm","Gaussian membership function","fuzzy logic controller"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384547","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273954/04273995.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"1102","endPage":"1107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Auto-Tuning of Membership Functions and Fuzzy Control Rules Using Genetic Algorithms","abstract":"A novel genetic algorithm is proposed to design membership functions and to reduce the number of fuzzy control rules simultaneously since these two components are interdependent in a fuzzy logic controller. With Gaussian membership functions, the centers and the widths of these functions, the fuzzy control rules corresponding to every possible combination of input linguistic variables are chosen as parameters to be optimized. In transforming these parameters into corresponding chromosomes, a mixed coding technique is adopted. Moreover, the concept of enlarged sampling space and ranking mechanism are used to expedite the convergence of the evolutionary process. To show the feasibility and validity of the proposed method, the design of a cart-centering controller using as few as possible fuzzy control rules will be given.

The coefficients obtained from 4-level db4 and the corresponding watermark is used for training the CPN. Different from the traditional methods, the watermark is embedded in the synapses of CPN instead of the original audio signal. In addition, because of the watermark is memorized in the synapses, most of the attacks are not degrade the quality of the extracted watermark image. Moreover, the watermark embedding procedure and extracting procedure are integrated into the proposed CPN.

TRs cover more than ten percent of the human genome. They have been proven to play an important role in human diseases, regulation, and evolution. TRs vary for different individuals, so they are commonly used in human gene mapping, linkage studies, and forensic DNA fingerprinting analysis. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is presented for detecting TRs, especially short tandem repeats (STRs), in a DNA sequence. The algorithm, based on the autoregressive (AR) model, is to analyze the spectrum of the DNA sequences. Our algorithm can find TRs effectively and quickly. Furthermore, it is robust to mutations, deletions, and insertions. In comparison with the fast Fourier transform (FFT), our results show that the AR model based algorithm can provide more detailed qualitative information than the FFT when we analyze the spectrum of the STRs. Here, the methods and ideas underlying the algorithm are presented and the effectiveness of the algorithm on TRs is demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autoregressive Models for Spectral Analysis of Short Tandem Repeats in DNA Sequences","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384892","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273954/04274026.pdf","startPage":"1286","endPage":"1290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Autoregressive Models for Spectral Analysis of Short Tandem Repeats in DNA Sequences","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4274026/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772435","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autoregressive Models for Spectral Analysis of Short Tandem Repeats in DNA Sequences","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-2-72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05475S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4273954","articleId":"4274026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4274030,"authors":[{"name":"Huang-Chu Huang","affiliation":["Electric Communication Department, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huang-Chu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275100600"},{"name":"Shang-Jen Chuang","affiliation":["Electric Communication Department, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Jen","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37288215600"},{"name":"Chuo-Yean Chang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Cheng Shiu University, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuo-Yean","lastName":"Chang","id":"37290547700"},{"name":"Yu-Ju Chen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Cheng Shiu University, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ju","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293329800"},{"name":"Rey-Chue Hwang","affiliation":["Electric Engineering Department, Cheng Shiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Electrical Engineering Department, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rey-Chue","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37286966900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274030","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Power generation","Power generation economics","Predictive models","Economic forecasting","Power system management","Ice","Environmental economics","Fuel economy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air conditioning","neural nets","refrigeration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent RT forecaster","ice-storage air-conditioner","neural network","intelligent refrigeration ton forecaster","energy saving","CLTD-CLF models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274030","abstract":"In this paper, an intelligent refrigeration ton (RT) forecaster of the ice-storage air-conditioning system by using neural network is proposed.

Thus SP-MEC can further effectively converge to the Pareto front, and achieve the high-quality trade-off front for multi-objective optimization. The features of the proposed SP-MEC are the employments of the relation of Pareto and density information of individuals. Therefore, the optimal solutions acquired by our SP-MEC distribute uniformly on the Pareto front. The feasibility and efficiency of this SP-MEC are demonstrated using numerical examples.

The Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) equipped with an improved evolutionary direction operator and a migration operation can efficiently search and actively explore solutions. The Multiplier Updating (MU) technique is introduced to avoid deforming the augmented Lagrange function and resulting in difficulty to solution searching. To handle the multi-objective problem, the \u03b5-constraint technique is employed. The proposed approach integrates the \u03b5-constraint technique, IGA, and the MU technique. The simulation using the proposed method is carried out on a 6-unit test system, and the results are compared with that obtained using other different methods. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach is superior to other methods in solution quality and computational burden.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274078/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9790815","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4274078/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Objective Optimization for Power Economic Dispatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Objective Optimization for Power Economic Dispatch","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-2-124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049702S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4273954","articleId":"4274078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4274084,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is, however, of great importance that the improvements are not at the cost of higher operator workload and control activity, which strongly depends on how haptic feedback is presented to the operator. This paper describes the study on two different techniques of haptic feedback for collision avoidance in the tele-operation of a UAV helicopter. The first technique considers the addition of an external force offset generated by an artificial force field, whereas the second technique considers the addition of an external spring constant. The study involves a theoretical analysis and an experimental evaluation of the two haptic feedback implementations. Experiment results indicate that the use of the external spring constant outperforms the force offset. Operator performance improves and workload decreases with equivalent control activity and level of safety with respect to the use of force offset.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4273954","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1623","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4273954/04274084.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Haptic Feedback for UAV Tele-operation - Force offset and spring load modification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4274084/","displayDocTitle":"Haptic Feedback for UAV Tele-operation - Force offset and spring load modification","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772259","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Haptic Feedback for UAV Tele-operation - Force offset and spring load modification","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-2-130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071988S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4273954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4273954","articleId":"4274084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274128,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Teng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278412100"},{"name":"Shi-An Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shi-An","lastName":"Chen","id":"37420617200"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37558625900"},{"name":"Chao-Ting Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Ting","lastName":"Hong","id":"37928257800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274128","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274128","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Cellular neural networks","Video equipment","Computer architecture","Chaos","Image sequences","Optical sensors","Control engineering","Image converters","Motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","image segmentation","image sequences","motion compensation","motion estimation","stability","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN-based local motion estimation","image stabilization","IS technique","image sequence","hand-held camcorder","motion compensation","adaptive-threshold method","cellular neural network"]}],"abstract":"The objective of this paper is to investigate a novel design for local motion vectors (LMVs) of image sequences, which are often used in a digital image stabilization (IS) system. The IS technique removes unwanted shaking phenomenon in image sequences captured by hand-held camcorders. It includes two main parts such as motion estimation and compensation. Most of computation power occurs in the part of motion estimation. In order to reduce this complexity, an idea, which integrates an adaptive-threshold method and cellular neural networks (CNN) architecture, is designed to improve this problem. The design only implements the most important local motion estimation with the array size of 19x25 pixels.

The proposed adaptive tuning strategy is based on self-tuning of the parameters of PSO, which strategy utilize the information about the frequency of an updated global best of a swarm. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed adaptive PSO algorithm are demonstrated through some numerical simulations using two typical global optimization test problems.","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274116/04274212.pdf","startPage":"2303","endPage":"2308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization; Self-coordinating Mechanism with Updating Information","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385206","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization; Self-coordinating Mechanism with Updating Information","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9790809","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4274212/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization; Self-coordinating Mechanism with Updating Information","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-3-96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060947S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4274116","articleId":"4274212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4274220,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In the traditional methods for ACM, the best candidates are searched in a small window. Consequently, the boundary concavities cannot be searched accurately. Some improvements have been made in the past to enlarge the searching space, yet they are still time-consuming. To overcome these drawbacks, a multi-population particle swarm optimization technique is adopted in this paper to reduce the search time but in a larger searching window. This optimizer inherits the spirit of the original PSO as well as shares information among the swarms surrounding control points. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the search of object concavities without spending extra time.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385222","startPage":"2396","endPage":"2400","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274116/04274228.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Contour Model Based on Multi-Population Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active contours","Particle swarm optimization","Deformable models","Shape control","Convergence","Humans","Cybernetics","Automatic control","Image segmentation","Spline"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active contour model","multipopulation particle swarm optimization","concavity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Active Contour Model Based on Multi-Population Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4274228/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772540","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Contour Model Based on Multi-Population Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-3-112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100783S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4274116","articleId":"4274228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274232,"authors":[{"name":"Huaifeng Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Huaifeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293139400"},{"name":"Wenjing Jia","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Jia","id":"37285553500"},{"name":"Xiangjian He","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiangjian","lastName":"He","id":"37293267000"},{"name":"Qiang Wu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290355900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274232","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Licenses","Detection algorithms","Information technology","Australia","Lighting","Helium","Robustness","Algorithm design and analysis","Vehicles","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image colour analysis","object detection","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast algorithm","vertical edge map","license plate detection algorithm","cascade classifier","statistical features","Haar-features","license plates size","license plates color"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a fast algorithm detecting license plates in various conditions.

In addition, neural network PID (NNPID) position and velocity controllers provide the necessary control actions to maintain synchronization while following a variable command trajectory. A delay-time compensator (DTC) with a neural network controller was augmented to set the time delay element be effectively moved outside the closed loop such that the stability of the robust controlled system is enhanced. This scheme provides strong robustness with respect to uncertain dynamics and nonlinearities.

Results show that the proposed methodology leads to shorten design cycles achieving important resource savings by employing specialized fixed-point representations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385252","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274116/04274258.pdf","startPage":"2577","endPage":"2583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology to Design FPGA-based PID Controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274258/","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology to Design FPGA-based PID Controllers","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772636","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4274258/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology to Design FPGA-based PID Controllers","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-3-142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119192S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4274116","articleId":"4274258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274274,"authors":[{"name":"Anirban Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["University of Kalyani, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Anirban","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37302273500"},{"name":"Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Sanghamitra","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37270160000"},{"name":"Ujjwal Maulik","affiliation":["Jadavpur University, Kolkata, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Ujjwal","lastName":"Maulik","id":"37298345500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274274","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274274","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Image segmentation","Clustering methods","Encoding","Optimization methods","Fuzzy sets","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Remote sensing","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","image segmentation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-objective genetic algorithm","image segmentation","multiobjective fuzzy genetic clustering technique","remote sensing image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy clustering","genetic algorithm","multiobjective optimization","pareto-optimal","cluster validity measures","remote sensing imagery"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385268","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274116/04274274.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2678","endPage":"2683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm and its Application to Image Segmentation","abstract":"This article presents a multiobjective fuzzy genetic clustering technique employing real coded encoding of cluster centers. Recent research has shown that clustering techniques that optimize a single objective may not provide satisfactory result because no single validity measure works well on different kinds of data sets. This fact has motivated us to develop a multiobjective fuzzy genetic clustering method that optimizes multiple validity measures simultaneously. User can chose any partitioning result from the resultant set of non dominated solutions according to the problem requirements. A number of artificial and real-life data sets have been clustered using the proposed fuzzy clustering method. Also the proposed algorithm has been applied for segmentation of a remote sensing image to show its effectiveness in pixel classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274274/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9772600","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4274274/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Clustering using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm and its Application to Image Segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm and its Application to Image Segmentation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-3-158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057134S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4274116","articleId":"4274274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274302,"authors":[{"name":"Qiangfu Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Aizu, Japan"],"firstName":"Qiangfu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290792400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274302","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274302","abstract":"An NNC-tree is a decision tree (DT) with each non-terminal node containing a nearest neighbor classifier (NNC).

Nevertheless, different problems may require different network architectures and parameters. Therefore, rule of thumb or \"try and error\" methods are usually used to determine them. However, these methods may lead worse network architectures and parameters. A dataset may contain many features; however, not all features are beneficial for classification in BPN. Therefore, a simulated annealing (SA) approach is proposed to select the beneficial subset of features and to obtain the better network architectures and parameters which result in a better classification. In order to verify the developed approach, three dataset, namely PIMA, IONOS, and CANCER from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning database, are employed for evaluation, and the 10-fold cross-validation is applied to calculate the classification result. Compared with the MONNA (multiple ordinate neural network architecture) structure developed by Leazoray and Cardot, the classification accurate rates of the developed approach are superior to those of the MONNA. When the feature selection is taken into consideration, the classification accurate rates of three dataset are increased. Therefore, the developed approach can be utilized to find out the network architecture and parameters of BPN, and discover the useful attributes effectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385301","startPage":"2819","endPage":"2824","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274280/04274308.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Back-Propagation Network Using Simulated Annealing Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Information management","Computational efficiency","Cancer","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Classification tree analysis","Circuits","Computer architecture","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","data mining","neural net architecture","pattern classification","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["back-propagation network optimization","simulated annealing approach","data mining technique","network architectures","dataset classification","PIMA dataset","IONOS dataset","CANCER dataset","University of California, Irvine machine learning database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Back-Propagation Network Using Simulated Annealing Approach","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4274308/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772450","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Back-Propagation Network Using Simulated Annealing Approach","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-4-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090864S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4274280","articleId":"4274308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4274357,"authors":[{"name":"Leandro dos Santos Coelho","affiliation":["Production and Systems Engineering Graduate Program, Automation and Systems Laboratory, Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"dos Santos Coelho","id":"37545116400"},{"name":"Viviana Cocco Mariani","affiliation":["Production and Systems Engineering Graduate Program, Automation and Systems Laboratory, Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Viviana Cocco","lastName":"Mariani","id":"37593034900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274357","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with Quasi-Newton Local Search for Solving Economic Dispatch Problem","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274280/04274357.pdf","startPage":"3109","endPage":"3113","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274280","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384593","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power generation","Power generation economics","Fuel economy","Cost function","Equations","Power system economics","System testing","Character generation","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load dispatching","particle swarm optimisation","power generation economics","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","quasi-Newton local search","economic dispatch problem","social psychological metaphor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274357","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population-based swarm intelligence algorithm driven by the simulation of a social psychological metaphor instead of the survival of the fittest individual.

A new identification approach with neural network based compensation of uncertain dynamics is proposed. Based on this approach, parameter identification process is divided into two steps. The first step is to determine unknown dynamic parameters using inverse dynamics of the robot manipulator and pseudo-inverse matrices. The second step is to establish a dynamic compensator by neural network and learning method for improving accuracy of the dynamic model with parameters given in the first step. A Direct Drive (DD) SCARA type industrial robot arm AdeptOne is used as an application example for the parameter identification. Simulations and experiments are carried out. Comparison of the results confirms the correctness and usefulness of the proposed identification method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384627","startPage":"3298","endPage":"3303","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274280/04274391.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Aided Dynamic Parameter Identification of Robot Manipulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Neural networks","Parameter estimation","Service robots","Equations","Lagrangian functions","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control","Servomotors","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","control engineering computing","industrial manipulators","inverse problems","learning (artificial intelligence)","manipulator dynamics","matrix algebra","neural nets","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot manipulators","neural network compensator","uncertain dynamic parameter identification","inverse dynamics","pseudo inverse matrices","dynamic compensator","learning method","direct drive SCARA type industrial robot arm","AdeptOne robot manipulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Aided Dynamic Parameter Identification of Robot Manipulators","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4274391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Aided Dynamic Parameter Identification of Robot Manipulators","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-4-111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104422S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4274280","articleId":"4274391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4274396,"authors":[{"name":"Ted Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Northern Taiwan Institute of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ted","lastName":"Tao","id":"37529543600"},{"name":"Chuan-Chu Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Northern Taiwan Institute of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan-Chu","lastName":"Ding","id":"37943000400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274396","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Codes Transmitting in Pyramidal CMAC Networks","abstract":"Differential codes transmitting in pyramidal CMAC networks to improve image PSNR is proposed in this paper.

In the meanwhile, differential codes are transmitted in the proposed pyramidal architecture by the request of receiver to improve the image quality. As a result, the reconstructed image at the bottom of pyramidal CMAC networks will get higher PSNR. Finally, pyramidal CMAC networks are applied to JPEG compression.

The purpose of sign sounds is to communicate a message. However the ease of message understanding and listening comfort have rarely been taken into consideration. Because people have different tastes and attach a different \"image\" to sign sounds according to their individual sensibility, it is important for each person to be able to make melodies freely and easily, and customize sign sounds. We propose a sign sounds design system using an Interactive genetic algorithm (IGA). The proposed system produces a melody of two bars based on this IGA. A melody is considered to be a sort of \"organism,\" whose chromosome consists of genes indicating the length, pitch, and velocity of the notes of the melody. Experimental results showed that this system is effective for generating sign sounds. In creating auditory signals, it was found that the method of evolving part-by-part is better than the method of evolving the whole two bars.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384659","startPage":"3486","endPage":"3490","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274280/04274423.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Sign Sounds using an Interactive Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Home appliances","Bars","Context","Mobile handsets","Switches","Cybernetics","Organisms","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","auditory displays","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive genetic algorithm","message understanding","listening comfort","sign sounds design system","auditory signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of Sign Sounds using an Interactive Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4274423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772573","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Sign Sounds using an Interactive Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-4-143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046047S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4274280","articleId":"4274423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4274464,"authors":[{"name":"Setu Madhavi Namburu","affiliation":["Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Setu Madhavi","lastName":"Namburu","id":"38558416100"},{"name":"Shunsuke Chigusa","affiliation":["Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Chigusa","id":"37295491300"},{"name":"Liu Qiao","affiliation":["Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37298030100"},{"name":"Mohammad Azam","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Azam","id":"37275985500"},{"name":"Krishna R.

In order to solve the problem of FDD in complex systems, such as modern vehicles, a hybrid methodology combining different techniques is needed. Here, we apply an approach based on signal analysis that combines various signal processing and statistical learning techniques for real-time FDD in automotive engines.

The SONNAC system is comprised of a neural controller and a compensation controller. The neural controller utilizes a self-organizing neural network (SONN) to mimic an ideal controller, and the compensation controller is designed to compensate for the approximation error between the neural controller and the ideal controller. When the approximation performance of the SONN is not good enough, the SONN can create new neurons in the hidden layer to decrease the approximation error. Moreover, the adaptive laws of controller parameters are derived in the sense of Lyapunov, so that the stability of the system can be guaranteed. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SONNAC system, the design methodology is applied to control a linear ultrasonic motor.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384712","startPage":"3743","endPage":"3748","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274438/04274477.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Organizing Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Control for Linear Ultrasonic Motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Neural networks","Control systems","Neurons","Stability","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Nonlinear systems","Control system synthesis","Backpropagation algorithms","Approximation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","linear motors","machine control","neurocontrollers","ultrasonic motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing neural-network-based adaptive control","linear ultrasonic motor","neural controller","compensation controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Self-Organizing Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Control for Linear Ultrasonic Motor","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4274477/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772235","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Organizing Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Control for Linear Ultrasonic Motor","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-5-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066335S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","xplore-issue":"4274438","articleId":"4274477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4274490,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Yang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhi-Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37933345000"},{"name":"Chao-Lin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Lin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290275600"},{"name":"Li-Chen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37278448600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274490","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semisupervised learning","Bayesian methods","Smart homes","Computer science","Chaos","Switches","Uncertainty","Cybernetics","TV","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","home automation","home computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","user centred design","user modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semisupervised learning","Bayesian network","personal preference modeling","home environment","smart home","user preference modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274490","abstract":"Smart home which understands user's preference and provides right services at right time is the current trend.

Our method exhibits high accuracy with simple calculations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384729","startPage":"3839","endPage":"3843","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274438","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274438/04274494.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Absolute Robot Pose Estimation System Based on a Ceiling Camera Image Using a Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274494/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Absolute Robot Pose Estimation System Based on a Ceiling Camera Image Using a Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4274494/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9791035","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Absolute Robot Pose Estimation System Based on a Ceiling Camera Image Using a Neural Network","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-5-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050426S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4274438","articleId":"4274494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4274502,"authors":[{"name":"Min Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Han","id":"37272698100"},{"name":"Mingning Fan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Mingning","lastName":"Fan","id":"37088147444"},{"name":"Zhiwei Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37291366400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274502","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","State-space methods","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Recurrent neural networks","Singular value decomposition","Nonlinear distortion","Time series analysis","Principal component analysis","Cybernetics","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing","chaos","feature extraction","identification","neural nets","prediction theory","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariate time series prediction","neural network","embedding theory","embedded time series","singular value decomposition","feature component extraction","dynamic system identification","chaotic benchmark system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multivariable systems","Neural network","SVD","Time series prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274502","abstract":"Multivariate time series are common in experimental and real systems. According to the embedding theory, in the absence of observational noise only one time series should be needed to recover dynamics. However, for real data, the noise always exist. There may be large advantages in using more measurements. In this paper, we focus on the issue of using multivariate time series to model and predict. The experiments show that by using multivariate time series the influence of noise could be reduced. Since the structure of the embedded time series is complex, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to extract feature components in the multivariate time series. Then the neural network (NN) is applied for identification of the dynamic system. The effectiveness of this method is shown by simulation of the real world multivariate time series as well as a well-known chaotic benchmark system.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384737","startPage":"3884","endPage":"3889","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274438","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274438/04274502.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariate Time Series Prediction by Neural Network Combining SVD","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274502/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multivariate Time Series Prediction by Neural Network Combining SVD","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4274502/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9790848","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariate Time Series Prediction by Neural Network Combining SVD","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-5-64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06054S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4274438","articleId":"4274502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4274514,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Lin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37934109200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274514","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274514","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Search engines","Image restoration","Pixel","Diffusion processes","Convergence","Computer graphics","Partial differential equations","Cybernetics","Streaming media","Filling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image texture","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-accelerated patch search engine","image completion","GPU-accelerated patch search engine","patch-based best-fit searching strategy","image linear structure","image texture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384749","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274438/04274514.pdf","startPage":"3949","endPage":"3954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hardware-Accelerated Patch Search Engine for Image Completion","abstract":"This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated patch search engine that efficiently Alls the unknown regions of an image caused by replacement or removal of part of the foreground. Previous approaches, such as inpainting and texture synthesis, are either fast, but not applicable for small-scale regions, or slow, but fills large regions with good quality. The algorithm in this paper is based on the patch-based best-fit searching strategy, in which a partly-known patch is filled by searching the known part of the image for a patch of pixels closely matching the known neighbors. This keeps the linear structure and texture of the image. Each patch is represented as a stream and processed in parallel in the GPU. We found that the exhaustive searching strategies used in previous work are the main cause of inefficiency; most matches are located in the neighborhood of the target patch. Inspired by this spatial continuity, we develop a very efficient search engine compared with previous work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274514/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"9772231","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4274514/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Hardware-Accelerated Patch Search Engine for Image Completion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hardware-Accelerated Patch Search Engine for Image Completion","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-5-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04335S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","xplore-issue":"4274438","articleId":"4274514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4274547,"authors":[{"name":"Shinn-Homg Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shinn-Homg","lastName":"Chen","id":"37673996300"},{"name":"Wen-Hsien Ho","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Hsien","lastName":"Ho","id":"37287446700"},{"name":"Jyh-Homg Chou","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyh-Homg","lastName":"Chou","id":"37274488800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274547","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274547","abstract":"This paper considers the robust-optimal design problems of output feedback controllers for linear systems with both time-varying elemental (structured) and norm-bounded (unstructured) parameter uncertainties. A new sufficient condition is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for ensuring that the linear output feedback systems with both time-varying elemental and norm-bounded parameter uncertainties are asymptotically stable, where the mixed quadratically-coupled parameter uncertainties are directly considered in the problem formulation. A numerical example is given to show that the presented sufficient condition is less conservative than the existing one reported recently. Then, by integrating the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) and the proposed LMI-based sufficient condition, a new integrative approach is presented to find the output feedback controllers of the linear systems with both time-varying elemental and norm-bounded parameter uncertainties such that the control objective of minimizing a quadratic integral performance criterion subject to the stability robustness constraint is achieved. A design example of the robust-optimal output feedback controller for the AFTI/F-16 aircraft control system with the time-varying elemental parameter uncertainties is given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed new integrative approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384782","startPage":"4136","endPage":"4141","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274438/04274547.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Output Feedback Control for Linear Uncertain Systems Using LMI-Based Approach and Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Optimal control","Linear feedback control systems","Control systems","Uncertain systems","Genetic algorithms","Time varying systems","Robust control","Sufficient conditions","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","control system synthesis","feedback","genetic algorithms","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","minimisation","optimal control","robust control","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust-optimal output feedback controller design","linear uncertain systems","LMI-based approach","genetic algorithm","time-varying elemental parameter uncertainties","norm-bounded parameter uncertainties","linear matrix inequalities","asymptotic stability","hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm","quadratic integral performance criterion minimization","stability robustness constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Output Feedback Control for Linear Uncertain Systems Using LMI-Based Approach and Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4274547/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9790988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Output Feedback Control for Linear Uncertain Systems Using LMI-Based Approach and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-5-109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062354S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4274438","articleId":"4274547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4274548,"authors":[{"name":"Ker-Wei Yu","affiliation":["Department of Marine Engineering, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ker-Wei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37291085400"},{"name":"Zhi-Liang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Marine Engineering, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhi-Liang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37931173200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274548","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Particle swarm optimization","Control systems","Particle tracking","Cybernetics","Stochastic processes","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","controllers","linear quadratic control","particle swarm optimisation","state feedback","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LQ regulator design","particle swarm optimization","linear-quadratic state-feedback"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274548","abstract":"In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based linear-quadratic (LQ) state-feedback regulator is investigated.

Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm performs well on the optimization of the length of the route.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274551/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9772637","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4274551/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Study of the Longest Non-Intersecting Route Problem Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Study of the Longest Non-Intersecting Route Problem Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-5-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038907S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","xplore-issue":"4274438","articleId":"4274551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274581,"authors":[{"name":"Atsushi Ishigame","affiliation":["Electrical and Information Systems Department, School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Ishigame","id":"37389746700"},{"name":"Mitsuharu Higashitani","affiliation":["Electrical and Information Systems Department, School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuharu","lastName":"Higashitani","id":"37940854600"},{"name":"Keiichiro Yasuda","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichiro","lastName":"Yasuda","id":"37344363200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274581","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Lyapunov method","Power system control","Neural networks","Optimal control","Numerical simulation","Power system stability","Power system simulation","Power systems","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","learning systems","Lyapunov methods","minimax techniques","neurocontrollers","particle swarm optimisation","predator-prey systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural stabilizing controller","coevolutionary predator-prey","particle swarm optimization","Lyapunov method","learning system","neural network","min-max problem","Lyapunov stability condition","numerical simulation","power system stabilization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274581","abstract":"In this paper, an approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Lyapunov method to construct neural stabilizing controller is presented.

The robotic agents communicate using indirect communication to move towards the site of scale formation and collaborate to repair damages.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Collaborating Team of Spiking Neural Network Based Robotic Agents for Inaccessible Fluidic Environments","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385076","endPage":"4872","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274604/04274685.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"4867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274685","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent robots","Neurons","Calcium","Inhibitors","Service robots","Medical robotics","Biology computing","International collaboration","Minerals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","microrobots","mobile robots","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiking neural network","inaccessible fluidic environments","miniaturized robotic agents","genetic algorithm","adaptive crossover","Collaborating Team"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Collaborating Team of Spiking Neural Network Based Robotic Agents for Inaccessible Fluidic Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4274685/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9772263","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Collaborating Team of Spiking Neural Network Based Robotic Agents for Inaccessible Fluidic Environments","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-6-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062445S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","xplore-issue":"4274604","articleId":"4274685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274689,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Wen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Wen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37935171800"},{"name":"Chao-Lin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.

Government agencies, fund managers, and even small investors need to arm themselves with devices for predicting financial distresses in corporations, even when the financial problems are shadowed by malignant window dressing. In previous work, we explored the effectiveness of making predictions based on both financial ratios, including those proposed by Altman for the Z-score models and those used in the common-size analysis, and qualitative indicators, such as corporate governance. In this paper, we report results of our attempt to select the best features from the previously proposed features with genetic algorithms and gain ratio-based methods. Experimental results indicate that the selected features outperform the features used in the Z-score models. Not surprisingly, the genetic algorithms surpass the gain ratio-based methods in the task of feature selection.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385080","startPage":"4892","endPage":"4897","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274604/04274689.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection in Predicting Financial Distresses with Support Vector Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Support vector machines","Financial management","Accuracy","Government","Cybernetics","Chaos","Size measurement","Marketing and sales","Books"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic forecasting","feature extraction","financial data processing","genetic algorithms","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","feature selection","financial distress prediction","support vector machines","individual investors","financial institutions","malignant window dressing","gain ratio-based methods","data classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Using Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection in Predicting Financial Distresses with Support Vector Machines","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4274689/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9790919","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection in Predicting Financial Distresses with Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-6-85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059646S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4274604","articleId":"4274689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4274700,"authors":[{"name":"En-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"En-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37943412900"},{"name":"Li-Chen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37278448600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274700","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"abstract":"In this paper, we present an approach to infer the arm pose in real-time for human-computer interaction.

Therefore, an automatic head tracking system in indoor cluttered environment is proposed. This system consists of two parts, automatic head tracking system and remote monitoring and control system. In the automatic head tracking system, the position of human head on image plane can be determined based on head tracking strategy. According to the position and size of human head on image plane, a suitable fuzzy rule is designed to maintain the position of human head near image center with appropriate size by controlling the active camera via pan, tilt, and zoom. Specifically, the position of the moving object on image plane can be determined using moving object detection method. Then a sizable tracking window to track human head is used to reduce redundant computation. Moreover, color recognition, template matching, and head contour matching methods are integrated for tracking human head robustly. In order to achieve better performance, Kalman filtering is employed to predict the position of human head on image plane. The proposed active head tracking system has been successfully validated in indoor cluttered environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274737/","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4274737/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9772593","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Active Head Tracking Using Integrated Contour and Template Matching in Indoor Cluttered Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Head Tracking Using Integrated Contour and Template Matching in Indoor Cluttered Environment","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ICSMC-6-133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056245S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4273787","isNumber":"4274604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4273787","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4274604","articleId":"4274737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4274755,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Rong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Rong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37423344900"},{"name":"Hang-Sheng Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hang-Sheng","lastName":"Lee","id":"37559125000"},{"name":"Wenta Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wenta","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37415185900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0100-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"4274755","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274755","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Genetic algorithms","Power system planning","Capacitors","Power system control","Power system simulation","Power systems","Optimal control","Voltage control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","genetic algorithms","power system control","reactive power control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal reactive power planning","genetic algorithm","transmission system","optimal shunt capacitor single unit capacity","peak power system","bus voltage control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","optimal reactive power planning","shunt capacitor","single unit amount"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385146","pdfPath":"/iel5/4273787/4274604/04274755.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"5275","endPage":"5279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2006.385146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Reactive Power Planning Using Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"This paper is proposed an optimal shunt capacitor planning of a transmission system using genetic algorithm.

In a bottom-up system design approach using nano-crossbar applications are typically mapped into a crossbar using either PLA or lookup table (LUT) implementation of a logic circuits. LUT-based implementation has some definite advantages over PLA-based one due its easy reconfigurability. In this paper, we consider a LUT-based logic design paradigm using nano-crossbar and propose a novel application mapping technique that can effectively take advantage of certain defects in the LUTs. The main idea is: 1) to identify and localize the unidirectional stuck-at faults in the LUTs and 2) then map an application in such a way that the a particular defective LUT is used to map a Boolean function which is compatible with the behavior of the LUT. The idea of exploiting certain defects to implement a function (as opposed to discard the defective location as unusable), improves yield considerably in LUT-based configurable nanocomputing. Our simulation with 5times5 and 5times1 LUT shows an average improvement of 87% in number of mapped function over conventional mapping for a defect rate of 10%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4274817/","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868906","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Defect-Aware Configurable Computing in Nanoscale Crossbar for Improved Yield","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defect-Aware Configurable Computing in Nanoscale Crossbar for Improved Yield","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"29180029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044889S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4274802","isNumber":"4274803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4274802","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4274803","articleId":"4274817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274819,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Rossi","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37273952600"},{"name":"Paolo Angelini","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Angelini","id":"37937280200"},{"name":"Cecilia Metra","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Cecilia","lastName":"Metra","id":"37279994900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2918-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"4274819","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Network-on-a-chip","Quality of service","Decoding","Integrated circuit interconnections","Crosstalk","Communication switching","Switches","Packet switching","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error detection codes","Hamming codes","network-on-chip","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error control scheme","NoC signal integrity","network on chips","correction mode","detection mode","mixed mode","quality of service","QoS levels","SEC hamming codes","SEC-DED Hsiao codes","symbol error correcting codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274819","abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel error control scheme to cope with errors affecting the communication links of a NoC.

In this paper it is demonstrated, using a 90-nm test vehicle, that there is a significant sample-to-sample variation in SER and a strong dependency on the data state of the bit-cell. The well-known voltage dependency causes an additional spread in the observed SER. Samples processed in different corners show a small but significant variation, which is not directly linked to speed. Simulations show that this variation is not caused by a spread in the critical charge, but is due to a difference in charge collection efficiency. The observed spread in SER tends to increase with technology scaling and should be taken into account when an SRAM technology is characterized.","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4274802/4274803/04274834.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread in Alpha-Particle-Induced Soft-Error Rate of 90-nm Embedded SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2007.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2007.63","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spread in Alpha-Particle-Induced Soft-Error Rate of 90-nm Embedded SRAMs","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868922","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4274834/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread in Alpha-Particle-Induced Soft-Error Rate of 90-nm Embedded SRAMs","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"29180131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042003S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4274802","isNumber":"4274803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4274802","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4274803","articleId":"4274834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274836,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The error detectors are derived automatically using compiler-based static analysis from the backward program slice of critical variables in the program. Critical variables are defined as those that are highly sensitive to errors, and deriving error detectors for these variables provides high coverage for errors in any data value used in the program. The error detectors take the form of checking expressions and are optimized for each control flow path followed at runtime. The derived detectors are implemented using a combination of hardware and software. Experiments show that the derived detectors incur low performance overheads while achieving high detection coverage for errors that impact the application.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4274802/4274803/04274853.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS 2007)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2007.21","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2007.21","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS 2007)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274853","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Computer crashes","Error correction","Runtime","Application software","Hardware","Protection","Error correction codes","Computer bugs","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program slicing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated derivation","application-aware error detectors","static analysis","backward program slice"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Critical Variables","Compiler techniques","backward slicing","checking expression","path-tracking."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274853/","displayDocTitle":"Automated Derivation of Application-aware Error Detectors using Static Analysis","accessionNumber":"9868941","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4274853/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Derivation of Application-aware Error Detectors using Static Analysis","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"29180211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042934S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4274802","isNumber":"4274803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4274802","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4274803","articleId":"4274853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4274854,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel G.

Fault tolerant implementations, based on Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) infrastructures, help to keep the correct operation of the circuit. However, TMR is not sufficient to guarantee the safe operation of a circuit. Other issues like module placement, the effects of multi- bit upsets (MBU) or fault accumulation, have also to be addressed. In case of a fault occurrence the correct operation of the affected module must be restored and/or the current state of the circuit coherently re-established. A solution that enables the autonomous restoration of the functional definition of the affected module, avoiding fault accumulation, re-establishing the correct circuit state in real-time, while keeping the normal operation of the circuit, is presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2007.50","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4274802/4274803/04274854.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2007.50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Self-Healing of Circuits Implemented on Reconfigurable FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"On-Line Self-Healing of Circuits Implemented on Reconfigurable FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4274854/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868942","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Line Self-Healing of Circuits Implemented on Reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"29180217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079709S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4274802","isNumber":"4274803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4274802","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4274803","articleId":"4274854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274928,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Bauer","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37411983400"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Dirk Teufel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Teufel","id":"37937582500"},{"name":"Jorg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2906-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3673"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3681"}],"articleNumber":"4274928","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific processors","Runtime","Process design","Layout","Embedded system","Processor scheduling","Monitoring","Libraries","Pattern matching","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","instruction sets","multiprocessing systems","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive extensible embedded processor","instruction set","processor scheduling","H.264 video encoder"]}],"abstract":"Extensible embedded processors allow the designer to adapt the instruction set to a certain application profile.

That means, during run time the processor analyzes the usage of special instructions and self-adapts when and how these are used and configured. We show that this kind of self-adaptation leads to a high efficiency (e.g. performance per chip area, etc.) and is superior to state-of-the-art extensible processors.

In comparison to the DF-STE not benefiting from this complexity reduction, the proposed detector is capable of reducing the complexity by several orders of magnitude. More quantitatively, for the specific rank-deficient system considered, which detected the signal transmitted from four transmit antennas with the aid of two receive antennas, the complexity might be reduced by a factor of 100 at low Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) without noticeable performance degradation. By contrast, at higher SNRs a complexity reduction of a factor of 10 might be achieved, depending on the tolerable performance degradation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Near-Maximum-Likelihood Detection for Decision Feedback Assisted Space-Time Equalization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05959","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04274991.pdf","startPage":"2407","endPage":"2411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Near-Maximum-Likelihood Detection for Decision Feedback Assisted Space-Time Equalization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4274991/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621404","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Near-Maximum-Likelihood Detection for Decision Feedback Assisted Space-Time Equalization","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059459S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4274991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4274992,"authors":[{"name":"Cecilia Carbonelli","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany","Ming-Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Cecilia","lastName":"Carbonelli","id":"37268228400"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Ming-Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4274992","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Channel estimation","Ultra wideband technology","Fading","Multipath channels","RAKE receivers","Delay estimation","Robustness","Clustering algorithms","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","maximum likelihood estimation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustered ML channel estimation","ultra-wideband signal","ultrawideband communications system","UWB channel","maximum likelihood estimation","pulse distortion","BER degradation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274992","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.051006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","abstract":"The multipath capture of ultrawideband (UWB) communications systems can be dependent on the accuracy of channel estimation.

However, after lattice-reduction, the effective symbols become correlated and exhibit a non-zero mean. Hence, we derive the optimal MMSE SIC detector, which updates the mean and variance of the effective symbols at each SIC detection stage. As a result, the proposed detector achieves a better performance compared to its counterpart dispensing with updating the mean and variance, and performs close to the maximum likelihood detector.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04274997.pdf","startPage":"2438","endPage":"2443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4274997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Lattice-Reduction Aided Successive Interference Cancellation for MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","MIMO","Detectors","Silicon carbide","Maximum likelihood detection","Random variables","Transmitting antennas","Computer science","Receiving antennas","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","correlation methods","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal lattice-reduction","successive interference cancellation","MIMO systems","optimal mioimum- mean-squared-error","multiple-input multiple-output detectors","effective symbols","Gaussian distributed random variables"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4274997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Lattice-Reduction Aided Successive Interference Cancellation for MIMO Systems","volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4274997/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9612631","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Lattice-Reduction Aided Successive Interference Cancellation for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06202S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4274997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4274999,"authors":[{"name":"Changyoon Oh","affiliation":["Advanced Research Laboratory, Global Standards and Research Team, Telecommunications R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea","Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory (WCAN), Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4274999/4274999-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changyoon Oh (S01, M06) received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

In measurement campaign I (MC I), the channel is static and we sample it spatially, while in MCII the transmitting and receiving antennas are fixed and channel variation is induced by people moving in the environment. Transmitter and receiver are separated by up to 27 m in MC I and up to 20 m in MC II. To determine suitable small-scale fading distributions for the tap amplitudes of the discrete-time baseband-equivalent channel impulse response, we use Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Despite the large bandwidth, AIC supports the Rayleigh (MCI) or the Rice distribution (MC II). For data from MC II, we estimate the covariance matrix of the random channel impulse response and demonstrate that the number of corresponding significant eigenvalues, and hence the diversity order of the channel, scales approximately linearly with bandwidth. Contrary to the uncorrected scattering assumption, we find that the channel taps are weakly correlated. The ergodic capacity predicted by the Ricean channel model with parameters estimated from MC II shows good agreement with the ergodic capacity obtained by direct evaluation of the measurement results, while the corresponding outage capacities show a worse fit for low outage probabilities because of shadowing.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275000.pdf","startPage":"2464","endPage":"2475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawideband Channel Modeling on the Basis of Information-Theoretic Criteria","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Ultrawideband Channel Modeling on the Basis of Information-Theoretic Criteria","volume":"6","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9617551","htmlLink":"/document/4275000/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrawideband Channel Modeling on the Basis of Information-Theoretic Criteria","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.295444S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275001,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275001/4275001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qian Huang received her Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from Shanghai University in 2002.

A distinguished feature of the proposed scheme is that the heavily punctured TCM codes are used for retransmissions of the corrupted data block, which are combined at the receiver with the previously received sequences of the same data block for decoding. By this method, significantly improved coding gain and efficient spectrum utilization can be achieved with very low complexity. A Markov model is developed to evaluate TCP throughput over the proposed HARQ in wireless link. By both analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that compared with other existing TCM-based ARQ schemes, significant improvement of TCP throughput over wireless links is achieved by the proposed CT-TCM HARQ while smaller buffer size is required at the access point.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275001.pdf","startPage":"2476","endPage":"2485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Wireless TCP Throughput by a Novel TCM-Based Hybrid ARQ","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improving Wireless TCP Throughput by a Novel TCM-Based Hybrid ARQ","volume":"6","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275001/","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616506","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275001/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Wireless TCP Throughput by a Novel TCM-Based Hybrid ARQ","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070179S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275002,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Barbieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria del\u013e Informazione Parco Area delle Scienze, Universit\u00e1 di Parma, Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275002/4275002-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alan Barbieri was born in Parma, Italy, in 1979.

Although the overall receiver complexity mainly depends on that of the CPM detector, almost all papers in the literature consider the optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) symbol detection algorithm and only a few attempts have been made to design low-complexity suboptimal schemes. This problem is faced in this paper by first considering the case of an ideal coherent detection, then extending it to the more interesting case of a transmission over a typical satellite channel affected by phase noise. In both cases, we adopt a simplified representation of an M-ary CPM signal based on the principal pulses of its Laurent decomposition. Since it is not possible to derive the exact detection rule by means of a probabilistic reasoning, the framework of factor graphs (FGs) and the sum-product algorithm (SPA) is used. In the case of channels affected by phase noise, continuous random variables representing the phase samples are explicitly introduced in the FG. By pursuing the principal approach to manage continuous random variables in a FG, i.e., the canonical distribution approach, two algorithms are derived which do not require the presence of known (pilot) symbols, thanks to the intrinsic differential encoder embedded in the CPM modulator.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275002.pdf","startPage":"2486","endPage":"2496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Soft-Output Detection of CPM Signals Over Coherent and Phase Noise Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275002/","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Soft-Output Detection of CPM Signals Over Coherent and Phase Noise Channels","volume":"6","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9617552","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275002/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Soft-Output Detection of CPM Signals Over Coherent and Phase Noise Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091726S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275004,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275004/4275004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li-Chun Wang received the B.S. degree from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, R.

Being continuously recharged, the battery does not need to be replaced regularly and the sensor node is maintenance-free. A key module in such sensor network solutions is the data link automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol, which must be designed to reliably deliver sensor nodes data at the minimum energy cost. With this objective in mind, two ARQ protocol classes are compared. In one class, each sensor node operates individually. In the other, the concept of cooperative communications is adopted, whereby neighboring sensor nodes help each other during the retransmission process. It is shown that the use of cooperative ARQ protocols in energy harvesting sensor networks enables sensor nodes to balance their energy consumption to match their own battery recharge rate. In turn, a balanced energy consumption-to-recharge rate ratio has the potential to improve the network throughput. Both classes of ARQ protocols are analyzed and compared. Estimated throughput gains are discussed under various network scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","startPage":"2519","endPage":"2529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275005.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative and Reliable ARQ Protocols for Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275005/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cooperative and Reliable ARQ Protocols for Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Nodes","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9611769","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative and Reliable ARQ Protocols for Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Nodes","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098758S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4275006,"authors":[{"name":"Veluppillai Mahinthan","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Department of E & CE, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275006/4275006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Veluppillai Mahinthan (S'02-GSM'06) was born in Jaffna, Sri Lanka.

To reduce the implementation and computational complexity, we develop a Worst-Link-First (WLF) matching algorithm, which gives the user with the worse channel condition and the higher energy consumption rate a higher priority to choose its partner. The computational complexity of the proposed WLF algorithm is O(n) while the achieved average energy gain is only slightly lower than that of the optimal maximum weighted- matching algorithm and similar to that of the 1/2-approximation Greedy matching algorithm (with computational complexity of O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n log n)) for a static-user network. We further investigate the optimal matching problem in mobile networks. By intelligently applying user mobility information in the matching algorithm, high cooperative diversity energy gain with moderate overhead is possible. In mobile networks, the proposed WLF matching algorithm, being less complex than the MW and the Greedy matching algorithms, yields performance characteristics close to those of the MW matching algorithm and better than the Greedy matching algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05890","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275006.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2530","endPage":"2539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing Cooperative Diversity Energy Gain for Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing Cooperative Diversity Energy Gain for Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275006/","volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4275006/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9676842","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing Cooperative Diversity Energy Gain for Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2530.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071892S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4275009,"authors":[{"name":"Shamaiah Manohar","affiliation":["Honeywell Technology Solutions Laboratory Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275009/4275009-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shamaiah Manohar received his Master of Engineering degree in Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2005, and the Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Visveswaraiah Technological University, Belgaum, Karnataka, India, in 2003.

In this paper, we present a multistage linear parallel interference cancellation (LPIC) approach to mitigate the effect of this MUI in uplink OFDMA. The proposed scheme first performs CFO compensation (in time-domain) followed by K DFT operations (where K is the number of users) and multistage LPIC on these DFT outputs. We scale the MUI estimates by weights before cancellation and optimize these weights by maximizing the average signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the output of the different stages of the LPIC. We derive closed-form expressions for these optimum weights. The proposed LPIC scheme is shown to effectively cancel the MUI caused by the other user CFOs in uplink OFDMA. While our proposed approach performs CFO compensation in time-domain, an alternate approach proposed recently by Huang and Letaief performs CFO compensation and interference cancellation in frequency-domain. We show that our approach performs better than the Huang & Letaief's approach when the magnitude of the CFO differences (between desired user CFO and other user CFOs) are small, whereas their approach performs better when the magnitude of the individual CFOs (of other users) are small. Since the CFO values can be arbitrary at the receiver, in order to make the receiver robust under various CFO conditions, we propose simple metrics based on CFO knowledge, which the receiver can compute and use to choose between the time-domain (ours) and the frequency-domain (Huang & Letaief's) cancellers so that better performance among the two approaches is achieved under various CFO conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","startPage":"2560","endPage":"2571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cancellation of Multiuser Interference Due to Carrier Frequency Offsets in Uplink OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cancellation of Multiuser Interference Due to Carrier Frequency Offsets in Uplink OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9617553","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275009/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cancellation of Multiuser Interference Due to Carrier Frequency Offsets in Uplink OFDMA","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070014S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275011,"authors":[{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275011/4275011-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Markku Juntti (S'93-M'98-SM'04) received his M.Sc.

This causes both spatial multiplexing interference (SMI) and downlink multiple access interference (MAI). In this paper, we derive an improved linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detector approximation suitable for MIMO-WCDMA systems. We also propose a new two-stage receiver architecture to suppress the effects of both MAI and SMI in HSDPA communications. SMI often dominates MAI, since it does not benefit from spreading gain. Therefore, a spatial maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector is used to suppress SMI, and a LMMSE based channel equalizer is applied as its front- end. The performance of the resulting LMMSE-MAP receiver structure is studied via Monte Carlo computer simulations with assumptions very realistically mimicking those of the HSDPA specification. The results show that it clearly outperforms the rake receiver or the improved LMMSE equalizer approximation, which, on the other hand, is also shown to be superior to the more conventional LMMSE equalizers.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275011.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","startPage":"2582","endPage":"2592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Equalizers for MIMO High Speed WCDMA Downlinks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Equalizers for MIMO High Speed WCDMA Downlinks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9691207","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275011/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Equalizers for MIMO High Speed WCDMA Downlinks","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148739S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4275012,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zeng","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275012/4275012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yonghong Zeng received the B.S. degree from the Peking University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China.

Only upper bounds for the channel orders and time delays are needed for implementing the algorithms, which makes them applicable to practical multiuser MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275012.pdf","startPage":"2593","endPage":"2601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time, Frequency Synchronization, and Equalization for Asynchronous Multiuser MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","MIMO","Delay effects","Delay estimation","Multipath channels","Wireless communication","Intersymbol interference","Doppler shift","Statistics","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","delays","MIMO communication","multipath channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time synchronization","frequency synchronization","equalization","asynchronous multiuser MIMO systems","multipath channels","carrier frequency offsets","Doppler shifts","blind method","second order statistics","minimum mean square error criteria","time delay","order over-estimation","doubly selective"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Time, Frequency Synchronization, and Equalization for Asynchronous Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4275012/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621409","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time, Frequency Synchronization, and Equalization for Asynchronous Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149509S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275013,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Ho","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275013/4275013-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul Ho (S'84-M'85) received the B.

It is demonstrated that every transmitted symbol in the proposed ST-MFSK scheme can be treated as an implicit pilot symbol, and consequently the receiver can attain close to ideal coherent bit-error performance even in the absence of an explicit channel sounding signal. In addition to employing the popular block-wise static fading model for performance evaluation, we also study the implications of a more realistic fading model whereby the fading gains are allowed to vary from one subinterval to another within a ST code block. It was discovered that an iterative channel estimation strategy has to be adopted to mitigate the cross-talk associated with this refined channel model. The iterative channel estimator, in conjunction with a companion minimum mean square error detector, or a companion maximum likelihood detector, enable the receiver to obtain a bit-error performance similar to that obtained under the block-wise static fading model. In comparison with differential ST-MPSK, the two approaches yield similar error performance in a static fading environment. However, the error performance of differential ST-MPSK deteriorates rapidly as the fade rate increases whereas the performance of ST-MFSK is almost independent of the fade rate. In terms of implementation complexity and delay of the receiver, the proposed coherent ST- MFSK scheme and differential ST-MPSK are very similar, as both approaches employ digital filters of similar lengths. The findings in this paper suggest that despite its larger bandwidth requirement, ST-MFSK is a very attractive alternative space-time signaling format.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05938","startPage":"2602","endPage":"2611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275013.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time FSK: An Implicit Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time FSK: An Implicit Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation Scheme","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","volume":"6","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275013/","accessionNumber":"9621410","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275013/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time FSK: An Implicit Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation Scheme","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063486S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4275014,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea","Wireless Networking and Communications Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275014/4275014-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wan Choi received the B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin in 2006.

Spread spectrum is a likely candidate for the extra diversity because spread spectrum can simultaneously provide frequency diversity and robustness to interference. This paper investigates the effectiveness of spatial multiplexing in the forward link of cellular MIMO-CDMA systems with linear receivers. Through the development of new closed-form results on outage probability and capacity for MIMO-CDMA, we show that even MIMO-CDMA loses the spatial multiplexing gain in a cellular context. These results indicate that a practical cellular MIMO system, which will be interference-limited and have a low-complexity receiver, requires new study on techniques to efficiently reduce the impact of the other-cell interference. The developed analytical framework can be used for evaluating other techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275014.pdf","startPage":"2612","endPage":"2621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing in Cellular MIMO-CDMA Systems with Linear Receivers: Outage Probability and Capacity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing in Cellular MIMO-CDMA Systems with Linear Receivers: Outage Probability and Capacity","volume":"6","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621411","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275014/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275014/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Multiplexing in Cellular MIMO-CDMA Systems with Linear Receivers: Outage Probability and Capacity","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134408S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275015,"authors":[{"name":"Serdar Sezginer","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275015/4275015-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Serdar Sezginer (S'99 - M'07) was born in Bandirma, Turkey, in 1977.

The algorithm consists of predistorting a set of input symbols per block using simple metrics, which measure how much each symbol contributes to the output signal samples of large magnitudes. The symbols to be predistorted in each block are selected as those with the largest positive-valued metrics. Predistortion of input symbols is performed either by scaling only the amplitude or by scaling separately the real and/or the imaginary parts of the selected symbols. The simple metric-based structure of the proposed algorithm gives high flexibility which enables various tradeoffs between performance and complexity. Another important feature is that the algorithm does not require transmitting any side information to the receiver and it does not involve any additional complexity for symbol detection at the receiver side. It is shown by simulations that a considerable improvement can be achieved with these simple techniques, which can be implemented as one-shot or iterative procedures.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275015.pdf","startPage":"2622","endPage":"2629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metric-Based Symbol Predistortion Techniques for Peak Power Reduction in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275015/","displayDocTitle":"Metric-Based Symbol Predistortion Techniques for Peak Power Reduction in OFDM Systems","volume":"6","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9612632","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275015/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metric-Based Symbol Predistortion Techniques for Peak Power Reduction in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048962S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275016,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Oberli","affiliation":["Faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275016/4275016-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Oberli received the B.S. degree from the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile (PUC) in 1994, and graduated summa cum laude in 1996 with the degree of Civil Industrial Engineer with a major in Electrical Engineering.

The goal is to accomplish those tasks with the smallest possible piloting overhead (highest spectral efficiency). For that, we derive a precise mathematical model that describes the joint effect of a CFO and SFO on the received MIMO-OFDM subcarriers. The model unifies simpler, well-known results found in the literature. We use it for deriving maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for both impairments based on observations of received pilot subcarriers at the output of the FFTs of the receiver branches. This approach yields estimators that are independent of the type of MIMO decoder, located further downstreams. At the same time, the estimators are the ML-optimal processors of pilot information at the MIMO channel's output. A pair of corresponding tracking algorithms based on the estimators is proposed and evaluated by simulation. The results show that the variance of our estimators decreases with larger MIMO configurations, allowing for increased synchronization accuracy at low SNR, or for reducing the number of pilot subcarriers to maintain equal estimator variance. We also show that the proposed tracking algorithms operate robustly under imperfect channel state information and with modulation sizes ranging from 4-QAM to 64-QAM. The SNR loss of the proposed algorithms is below 0.1 dB in all the cases, while a conventional tracking approach is shown to have an SNR loss between 0.8 dB and 1.2 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275016.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","startPage":"2630","endPage":"2639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML-based Tracking Algorithms for MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ML-based Tracking Algorithms for MIMO-OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9617554","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275016/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML-based Tracking Algorithms for MIMO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085335S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275017,"authors":[{"name":"Mung Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275017/4275017-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mung Chiang (S'00 - M'03) is an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering, and an affiliated faculty of Applied and Computational Mathematics and of Computer Science at Princeton University.

We show that in the high Signal-to- interference Ratios (SIR) regime, these nonlinear and apparently difficult, nonconvex optimization problems can be transformed into convex optimization problems in the form of geometric programming; hence they can be very efficiently solved for global optimality even with a large number of users. In the medium to low SIR regime, some of these constrained nonlinear optimization of power control cannot be turned into tractable convex formulations, but a heuristic can be used to compute in most cases the optimal solution by solving a series of geometric programs through the approach of successive convex approximation. While efficient and robust algorithms have been extensively studied for centralized solutions of geometric programs, distributed algorithms have not been explored before. We present a systematic method of distributed algorithms for power control that is geometric-programming-based. These techniques for power control, together with their implications to admission control and pricing in wireless networks, are illustrated through several numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275017.pdf","startPage":"2640","endPage":"2651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control By Geometric Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Control By Geometric Programming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275017/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9621412","htmlLink":"/document/4275017/","volume":"6","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control By Geometric Programming","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100268S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"575","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4275018,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio A.

For binary PPM modulation we propose a detection scheme that operates on signal energy measurements taken on small fractions (bins) of the symbol period. Assuming that the fractional energies of the channel response over those bins can be estimated in some way, we look for the decision strategy that minimizes the error probability. This leads us to a receiver structure that generalizes the conventional energy- detection scheme. The new strategy turns out to be superior to the conventional strategy and its performance is found to improve as the bin size decreases. A simple method is proposed to estimate the fractional energies of the channel response exploiting a training sequence. The impact of the estimation errors on the receiver performance is shown to be marginal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Detection UWB Receivers with Multiple Energy Measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05974","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275018.pdf","startPage":"2652","endPage":"2659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275018/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Detection UWB Receivers with Multiple Energy Measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4275018/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621413","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Detection UWB Receivers with Multiple Energy Measurements","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1166S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275019,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Fischer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275019/4275019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Fischer received a Master of Engineering degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Southampton (UK) in 1998 and a Doctorate from Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications (ENST Paris)lInstitut Eurecom (France) in 2002 for his research on signal processing for CDMAIUMTS.

In this paper, we show how the concept of load, as used in the CDMA network planning community, is linked to the Perron root and propose to use the Perron root as a load estimate. Specifically, we propose a practical iterative method to estimate the Perron root and revise various other approaches. All methods are analysed with respect to their suitability for analytical use in early-stage network planning. In addition, we extend the use of these methods from primitive matrices to cover the general case of non-negative channel gain matrices and illustrate the use of the irreducible normal form to provide tighter bounds than direct application under certain circumstances. In contrast to the use of traditional load equations, the proposed methods do not require the solution of the power allocation problem. Numerical examples show that particularly the proposed iterative solution provides very good results at low complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275019.pdf","startPage":"2660","endPage":"2668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load in CDMA Cellular Systems and its Relation to the Perron Root","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Power system planning","Equations","3G mobile communication","Capacity planning","Interference","Iterative methods","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Cellular networks","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","iterative methods","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA cellular systems","Perron root","power allocation problem","channel gain matrix","CDMA network planning community","load estimate","iterative method","primitive matrices","channel gain matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Load in CDMA Cellular Systems and its Relation to the Perron Root","volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4275019/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616509","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load in CDMA Cellular Systems and its Relation to the Perron Root","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063793S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4275020,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jun Kim","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275020/4275020-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Jun Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2005, all in electrical engineering.

By adopting the flow contention graph model and the resulting MAC constraints, the problem can be formulated into a linear programming problem, which can be solved distributively using dual decomposition. However, the message passing overhead of such a solution is high, since the information exchange must occur among the interfering links as well as the communicating links. In this work, the MAC layer constraints are relaxed in the form of a penalty function, which facilitates distributed optimization using only the collision statistic that each node can accumulate essentially at no extra cost. The resulting algorithm solves a convex optimization problem by a distributed primal-dual approach, where the network layer problem is solved in the dual domain, and the MAC layer problem is solved in the primal domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275020/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9611771","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Joint Routing and Medium Access Control for Lifetime Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Joint Routing and Medium Access Control for Lifetime Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102012S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4275021,"authors":[{"name":"Amine Maaref","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4274982/4275021/4275021-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amine Maaref (S'03) received the B.

A fixed per-stream SINR target is employed that allows guaranteed QoS for delay-sensitive applications. A straightforward application of single antenna power control is not possible in the MIMO context due to coordination between receive antennas and nonlinear dependence between interference and eigenspaces of the channel matrices. Two schemes are proposed to solve the problem. The first equally allocates power to all transmit antennas. Deriving an SINR lower bound based on an eigenvalue approximation of the composite interference, allows application of the conventional single antenna power control framework to solve this problem. To improve the feasibility performance, a second scheme is proposed that adaptively allocates power on the transmit antennas, where an iterative algorithm based on game theory is used to sequentially update each user's power distribution. The optimal solution with full channel knowledge, and a practical near-optimal solution requiring only partial channel knowledge, are both derived. Numerical results show that power control, compared to supposedly optimal waterfilling strategies, actually achieves higher throughput at the low SINRs typical in cellular systems, with significantly lower overhead and complexity. Due to its better exploitation of spatial diversity and reduced transmit power (and hence reduced interference), adaptive power allocation increases the achievable SINR by an order of magnitude over equal power allocation, resulting in far better coverage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Power Control in Multi-Cell Spatial Multiplexing Wireless Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.051007","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275023.pdf","startPage":"2700","endPage":"2711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.051007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Power Control in Multi-Cell Spatial Multiplexing Wireless Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4275023/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621415","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Power Control in Multi-Cell Spatial Multiplexing Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115971S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275024,"authors":[{"name":"Peter R.

The analysis is used to evaluate the delay- throughput performance of an adaptive decentralized inter- cell interference mitigation technique that exploits the inherent channel reciprocity of TDD. The main principle is that receivers upon successful transmission of a packet transmit a busy burst on a succeeding minislot. Potential transmitters in neighboring cells sense the minislot prior to signal transmission. With this mechanism, inter-cell interference to the existing link is avoided. The performance of this MAC (medium access control) protocol is compared against blind timeslot allocation. The new MAC protocol is shown to facilitate network self-organization, offering superior delay and throughput compared to the state of the art, with modest overhead and complexity requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of TDD Cellular Interference Mitigation Using Busy-Bursts","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05975","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4274982/04275025.pdf","startPage":"2721","endPage":"2731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4274982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of TDD Cellular Interference Mitigation Using Busy-Bursts","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4275025/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621416","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of TDD Cellular Interference Mitigation Using Busy-Bursts","sourcePdf":"tw_0707_2721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156694S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4274982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4274982","articleId":"4275025","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275082,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Viitaniemi","affiliation":["Adaptive Informatics Research Centre, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Viitaniemi","id":"37938808900"},{"name":"Jorma Laaksonen","affiliation":["Adaptive Informatics Research Centre, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jorma","lastName":"Laaksonen","id":"37269889300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1010-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1011-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3983"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3991"}],"articleNumber":"4275082","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Statistics","Image analysis","Vocabulary","Informatics","Image retrieval","Testing","Image databases","Computer aided software engineering","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic image annotation","global image features","normalised score","precision-recall statistics","Corel image benchmark annotation","desymmetrised termwise mutual information","PicSOM image content analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275082","abstract":"In this paper we consider two traditional metrics for evaluating the performance in automatic image annotation, the normalised score (NS) and the precision/recall (PR) statistics, particularly in connection with a de facto standard 5000 Corel image benchmark annotation task.

Finally, an enhanced version of the newly proposed single step algorithm is suggested to reach a near optimal performance","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty Third National Radio Science Conference (NRSC'2006)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275097/4275098/04275166.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty Third National Radio Science Conference (NRSC'2006)","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2006.386369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2006.386369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Fairness, Simplicity, and Near Optimal Performance in Rate Adaptation Algorithms for Wireless Multiuser OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Resource management","OFDM modulation","Bit rate","Quality of service","Bit error rate","Interference","Fading","Performance gain","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless multiuser OFDM system","rate adaptation algorithm","power distribution","optimal performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Fairness, Simplicity, and Near Optimal Performance in Rate Adaptation Algorithms for Wireless Multiuser OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275166/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9123326","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Fairness, Simplicity, and Near Optimal Performance in Rate Adaptation Algorithms for Wireless Multiuser OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Menouf, Egypt","sourcePdf":"NRSC-0-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047969S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4275097","isNumber":"4275098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275097","xplore-issue":"4275098","articleId":"4275166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Academy of Science","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275178,"authors":[{"name":"E.K.

This paper presents a digital hardware realization of a real-time simulator for a complete induction machine drive using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as the computational engine. The simulator was developed using very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL), making it flexible and portable. A novel device-characteristic based model suitable for FPGA implementation has been proposed for the 2-level 6- pulse IGBT-based voltage source converter (VSC). The VSC model is computed at a fixed time-step of 12.5 nanoseconds allowing a highly detailed and precise accounting of gating signals. The simulator also models a squirrel cage induction machine, a direct field-oriented control system, a space-vector pulse-width modulation scheme (SVPWM) and a measurement system. A multi-rate simulation of the system shows the slow (machine) as well as the fast (VSC and control) dynamic components. Real time simulation results under steady-state and transient conditions demonstrate modeling accuracy and efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385592","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275201.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Digital Hardware Simulation of Power Electronics and Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275201/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Digital Hardware Simulation of Power Electronics and Drives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10290200","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275201/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Digital Hardware Simulation of Power Electronics and Drives","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031089S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275204,"authors":[{"name":"Lingfeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280770900"},{"name":"Chanan Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chanan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37271764800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1296-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1298-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"}],"articleNumber":"4275204","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275204","abstract":"Renewable sources of energy have recently gained significant interest primarily due to traditional fuels' climbing prices, worries about the future oil supply, and increasing environmental concerns. However, some of these alternative energy sources are intermittent and their penetration may compromise the power system reliability. Thus, it poses a great challenge to achieve a cost-effective, emission-reduced, and reliable hybrid generation system. Due to the fluctuation of renewable power sources and the possible generator failures, it becomes necessary to carry out the reliability evaluation in the design stage to ensure the designed system has a certain degree of reliability in the presence of uncertainties. In this paper, three reliability indices for generating system adequacy assessment are used as design constraints or objectives in order to achieve reliability assurance during system operations. A modified multi-objective particle swarm optimization procedure is proposed to derive a set of Pareto-optimal system configurations in terms of cost and reliability. A numerical example is also presented to verify the validity and applicability of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385595","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275204.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adequacy-based Design of A Hybrid Generating System Including Intermittent Sources Using Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid power systems","Particle swarm optimization","Power system reliability","Power generation","Wind energy generation","Solar power generation","Power generation economics","Power system economics","Environmental economics","Power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","power generation reliability","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adequacy-based design","hybrid generating system","intermittent sources","constrained particle swarm optimization","renewable sources","power system reliability","degree of reliability","generating system adequacy assessment","modified multiobjective optimization procedure","Pareto-optimal system configurations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid generating system","particle swarm optimization","reliability","renewable sources of energy","multi-objective optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adequacy-based Design of A Hybrid Generating System Including Intermittent Sources Using Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10290203","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adequacy-based Design of A Hybrid Generating System Including Intermittent Sources Using Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082333S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275205,"authors":[{"name":"Huy Nguyen-Duc","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de g\u00e9nie \u00e9lectrique, Ecole de Technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Huy Nguyen-Duc received the B.S degree in Electrical Engineering from Ha noi university of Technology, Viet nam, in 2001 and M.S degree in Sherbrooke University, QC, Canada in 2003.

This paper assesses the online use of wavelet analysis to power system relaying. The paper presents a novel technique for transmission-line fault detection and classification using the DWT for which an optimal selection of mother wavelet and data window size based on the minimum entropy criterion has been performed. The paper starts with the review of recent work within the field of wavelet analysis and its applications to power systems engineering. Then, the theoretical background of the technique is presented and the proposed method is described in detail. Finally, the effect of different parameters on the algorithm are examined in order to highlight its performance. Typical fault conditions on a practical 220 kV power system as generated by ATP/EMTP is analyzed with Daubechies wavelets. The performance of the fault classifier is tested using MATLAB software. The feasibility of using wavelet analysis to detect and classify faults is investigated. Finally it discusses the results, limitations and possible improvement. It is found that the use of wavelet transforms together with an effective classification procedure is considered to be straightforward, fast, computationally efficient and allow for real-time accurate applications in monitoring and classifying techniques in power engineering.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275213.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Applications of Wavelet Transforms to Power System Relaying - Part II","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Power system relaying","Wavelet analysis","Power engineering","Electrical fault detection","Power system analysis computing","Power system faults","Signal analysis","Power quality","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMTP","entropy","fault diagnosis","mathematics computing","power system relaying","power transmission faults","power transmission lines","power transmission protection","relay protection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Daubechies wavelet transforms","power system relaying","transmission-line fault detection","data window size","minimum entropy criterion","power systems engineering","ATP/EMTP analysis","fault classifier","MATLAB software","protective relaying","voltage 220 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","protective relaying","digital signal processors","transient analysis","transforms","Fourier transforms","Modeling","Power system transients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Online Applications of Wavelet Transforms to Power System Relaying - Part II","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275213/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10286509","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Applications of Wavelet Transforms to Power System Relaying - Part II","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091851S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4275231,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe J.

A large part of the emissions rejected in the atmosphere comes from transportation vehicles, including cars, trucks or airplanes, due to the nature of their combustion-based propulsion systems. To contribute to solving the problem, our team has been working for several years on the development of high power density superconducting motors for aircraft propulsion. This paper investigates the feasibility of all-electric aircraft based on currently available technology through the presentation of several designs of machines. Electric propulsion would require the development of high power density electric propulsion motors and generators. The requirements in terms of weight and volume of these components cannot be achieved with conventional technologies; however, the use of superconductors associated with hydrogen based power plants makes possible the design of power components reasonably light and would therefore enable the development of all-electric aero-vehicles. Many advantages would come from electrical propulsion such as better controllability of the propulsion, higher efficiency, higher availability and less maintenance needs. This paper shows that high temperature superconducting machines are mature enough to be used in aircraft.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275231.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HTS Machines for Applications in All-Electric Aircraft","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High temperature superconductors","Aircraft propulsion","Atmosphere","Power generation","Pollution","Air transportation","Road transportation","Vehicles","Airplanes","Superconductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace propulsion","electric generators","electric motors","electric propulsion","electric vehicles","high-temperature superconductors","superconducting machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-electric aero-vehicles","pollutant emissions reduction","aircraft propulsion","electric propulsion","hydrogen based power plants","high temperature superconducting motors","HTS motors","electric generators","all-electric aircraft"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Superconducting motors","generators","all-electric aircraft"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"HTS Machines for Applications in All-Electric Aircraft","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275231/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10290223","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HTS Machines for Applications in All-Electric Aircraft","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065101S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275234,"authors":[{"name":"Hirohisa Aki","affiliation":["Energy Technology Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Hirohisa Aki (S'99, M'02) received a B.S. and M.S. in electrical engineering from Osaka University, Japan, in 1994 and 1996, respectively, and a Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Yokohama National University, Japan, in 2002.

Some of the non-linear characteristics of the generator, such as prohibited operating zones and ramp-rate limits are considered using the proposed method in practical generator operation. In this paper, a two executions of \"lambda-logic based\" algorithm is used. In the first execution, it determines the dispatch of generators considering ramp-rate limits and without considering prohibited operating zones. If there is no violation, the optimal dispatch is obtained. If there is a violation in units, set there limits, and then it uses an efficient approach to determine the most advantageous space using the average power of prohibited operating region. In the second execution, it obtains the optimal dispatch for the remaining units considering ramp- rate limits. The proposed method is very efficient for both small and large size of generating units with prohibited operating zones and ramp-rate limits in the problem and it remarkably reduces the computation time. The proposed algorithm has been tested successfully on 15 units and 40 units with some of the on-line units having prohibited operating zones and ramp-rate limits.

Our simulation experiments show that this model-based fault diagnostic approach is effective in detecting single switch open-circuit faults as well as post-short-circuit conditions occurring in power electronics inverter based electrical drives.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385655","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275264.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Fault Diagnosis in Electric Drive Inverters Using Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Fault Diagnosis in Electric Drive Inverters Using Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","accessionNumber":"10290248","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275264/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Fault Diagnosis in Electric Drive Inverters Using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105912S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4275281,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Fan Zhang was born in Jilin, China, in January 1980.

Frequency scanning in the subsynchronous frequency range is performed to calculate the subsynchronous electrical damping characteristics of the unit. Effects of excitation systems with moderate or high response on the electrical damping are investigated. Two situations including excitation system without PSS and with PSS are considered. At the same time, different input signals of PSS are used respectively. In addition, the effects of the parameters of PSS on the electrical damping are also investigated.

With the PSO method, we encode all the networks' weights and biases into several artificial neural network (ANN) system particle swarms, and then we train the network parameter values using the particle swarm optimization method proposed in this paper to locate the networks' optimal parameter solution. Next, we resolve the optimal STLF with the FNNs derived. The results by the proposed method are compared with that by other commonly-used load forecasting methods, such as the artificial neural network (ANN), the evolutionary programming combined with ANN (EP-ANN) and the genetic algorithm combined with ANN (GA-ANN).

Pade approximation method is used to express time delay and system state space model implying time delay is represented. The effect of delayed input signal is demonstrated by eigenvalue analysis. The effect might drive eigenvalue of the system matrix to undesirable places on complex plane, and even make the system unstable.

This paper presents an ATP/EMTP fault simulations studies based algorithm for high impedance fault detection in extra high voltage transmission line. The scheme recognizes the distortion of the voltage waveforms caused by the arcs usually associated with HIF. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based analysis, yields three phase voltage in the high frequency range which are fed to a classifier for pattern recognition. The classifier is based on an algorithm that uses recursive method to sum the absolute values of the high frequency signal generated over one cycle and shifting one sample. A HIF model of distribution is modified for EHV transmission lines. Characteristics of the proposed fault detection scheme are analyzed by extensive simulation studies that clearly reveal that the proposed method can accurately detect HIFs in the EHV transmission lines.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385458","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Impedance Faults Detection in EHV Transmission Lines Using the Wavelet Transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High Impedance Faults Detection in EHV Transmission Lines Using the Wavelet Transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275340/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10290318","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Impedance Faults Detection in EHV Transmission Lines Using the Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052871S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275345,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this paper, we mainly focus on the determination of the maximum time delay that system can sustain without losing small signal stability. Here we denote the maximum time delay as delay margin. Based on Rekasius substitution and Routh stability criterion, a simple approach to determine power system delay margin is introduced in this paper. Rekasius substitution is first used to transfer the system transcendental characteristic equation into a polynomial equation. Then Routh stability criterion is applied to determine the critical eigenvalue, the corresponding oscillation frequency and the system delay margin. Finally, a single-machine-infinite- bus system is employed to do some verification studies. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach are proved. Further, impacts of the exciter gain, generator mechanical output and generator damping to the system delay margin are deeply discussed. It is found that when the value of generation output and exciter gain increase, system delay margin will decrease. While relationship of generator damping and the delay margin is somewhat complex. Smaller generator damping does not mean smaller delay margin. Since time delays widely exist in the WAMS measurement, more studies should be done to properly consider their influence in future.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385467","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Approach to Determine Power System Delay Margin","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Approach to Determine Power System Delay Margin","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275349/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10290327","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Approach to Determine Power System Delay Margin","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062817S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4275351,"authors":[{"name":"ElSayed M.

The approach consists of determining a neural network structure suitable for predicting FF control inputs and setpoints based on optimal operating trajectories. The optimal trajectories were obtained in a previous study via nonlinear dynamic optimization based on a dynamic power plant model. Determination of the NN structure involves an a priori decision of the type of NN, the overall topology of input/output pairing, definition of a training epoch, as well as an identification of the number of hidden layer neurons and the number of iterations for the training epochs. This allows for straightforward training of the NN using the global training method, which includes all power profiles to define an epoch. In addition to training the NN with all available data, the network's prediction capabilities were tested by training it with all but one dataset and then determining the prediction results based on the untrained dataset. Results from eighteen case studies show that the developed NN supervisor is capable of predicting the optimized FF and setpoint trajectories satisfactorily.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385503","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275385.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Supervisor for Hybrid Fuel Cell/Gas Turbine Power Plants","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuel cells","Turbines","Power generation","Power system dynamics","Optimal control","Hybrid power systems","Power system modeling","Trajectory","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","fuel cell power plants","gas turbine power stations","hybrid power systems","neurocontrollers","optimal control","power generation control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network supervisor","hybrid fuel cell/gas turbine power plants","online estimation","optimal feedforward control","nonlinear dynamic optimization","dynamic power plant model","hidden layer neurons","global training method","setpoint trajectories","optimal operating trajectories"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuel cell","MCFC","hybrid fuel cell turbine power plants","dynamic optimization","neural network supervisor","setpoints","feedforward control","scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Supervisor for Hybrid Fuel Cell/Gas Turbine Power Plants","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10290361","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Supervisor for Hybrid Fuel Cell/Gas Turbine Power Plants","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083136S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275387,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang Y.

Moreover, the MPOC will use the OLID as a test process to optimize the control actions, minimizing tracking-error. To search for the best control action, the MPOC utilizes a heuristic optimization technique, particle swam optimization. With the proposed MPOC system the only input to the NNCM will be the unit load demand.

The developed neural network-based combined model (NNCM) consists of many processes which include air/flue gas, pulverizer, water/steam, and turbine/generator systems. The major inputs/outputs of the processes will be mass flow rate, temperature, pressure, and enthalpy of fluid. Moreover, control variables are utilized for driving the plant to desired states. For validation of the proposed model, a comparison of Rankine cycles between actual data and the output of the NNCM will be shown. The results of the NNCM will also be compared to actual plant data for major outputs.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385506","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275388.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network-Based Modeling for A Large-Scale Power Plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network-Based Modeling for A Large-Scale Power Plant","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","accessionNumber":"10290363","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275388/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network-Based Modeling for A Large-Scale Power Plant","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061238S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275434,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The polytopic model is used to guarantee the robustness of the controller with respect to the variations in the operating points of the system. The minimum damping ratio is used in the design stage as performance index for the closed loop system. The proposed controller is based on dynamic output feedback and uses only a local measurement of the active power flow as input signal for the controller, so communications links are avoided. The \"feasp\" solver, available in Matlab LMI Control Toolbox, is used to solve the set of LMIs formulated for the control problem. Performance analyses of the closed loop system were carried out by means of modal analysis and nonlinear simulations, showing that the controller is effective in improving the damping of inter-area oscillations of a two-area four-machine test system for several different operating points.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385579","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275461.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Design of a TCSC Supplementary Controller to Damp Inter-Area Oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Design of a TCSC Supplementary Controller to Damp Inter-Area Oscillations","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275461/","accessionNumber":"10299728","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275461/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Design of a TCSC Supplementary Controller to Damp Inter-Area Oscillations","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094448S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4275471,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

Similar to an electrical machine, source and converter flux are defined as the integration of the source and converter voltage respectively. Based on the defined flux, the proposed DPC scheme directly calculates the required converter voltage to eliminate the active and reactive power errors within each fixed time period. Thus, no extra power or current control loops are required, thereby simplifying the system design and improving transient performance. Constant converter switching frequency is achieved using space vector modulation which eases the design of the power converter and the AC harmonic filter. Simulation results for a 2 MW VSC system are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy during variations of active and reactive power and AC voltage dip.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275519.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275519","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Power conversion","Switching converters","Reactive power","Current control","Switching frequency","Harmonic filters","Robust control","Voltage control","Reactive power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power conversion harmonics","power grids","power harmonic filters","reactive power control","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct power control","grid connected voltage source converter","VSC","DPC scheme","switching frequency","AC harmonic filter","power converter","space vector modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant switching frequency","direct power control","VSC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Direct Power Control of Grid Connected Voltage Source Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10286540","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275519/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275519/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Power Control of Grid Connected Voltage Source Converters","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055285S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4275548,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In photovoltaic applications it is possible to remove the transformer in the inverter in order to reduce losses, costs and size. Galvanic connection of the grid and the DC sources in transformerless systems can introduce additional leakage currents because of the earth parasitic capacitance. This currents increase conducted and radiated electromagnetic emissions, harmonics injected in the utility grid and system losses. Amplitude and spectrum of ground current depends on the converter topology, on the switching strategy and on the resonant circuit formed by the ground capacitance, the converter, the AC filter and the grid. In this paper, the leakage current in a 1.5 kW photovoltaic installation is measured. The installation includes a string of sixteen panels, a full bridge inverter and a LCL filter. Influence of inverter topology and modulation strategy on the magnitude of the leakage current is presented. Finally, the use of neutral point clamped inverters in transformerless photovoltaic applications is studied.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385789","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275555.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eliminating ground current in a transformerless photovoltaic application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275555/","displayDocTitle":"Eliminating ground current in a transformerless photovoltaic application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10286683","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275555/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eliminating ground current in a transformerless photovoltaic application","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051675S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275559,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is essential to protect a microgrid in both the grid-connected and the islanded modes of operation against all types of faults. The major issue arises in island operation with inverter-based sources. Inverter fault currents are limited by the ratings of the silicon devices to around 2 p.u. rated current. Fault currents in islanded inverter based microgrids may not have adequate magnitudes to use traditional overcurrent protection techniques. The philosophy for protection is to have the same protection strategies for both islanded and grid-connected operation. The static switch is designed to open for all faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10300747","htmlLink":"/document/4275571/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Microgrid Protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microgrid Protection","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035318S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275578,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A special injection signal is used to excite the dynamics in certain frequency range, and then prediction error method (PEM) is employed to identify the reduced order system based on multiple inputs and outputs. Traditional optimal control techniques are improved to include the lead-lag blocks, so the popular supplementary damping controllers are compatible. Finally, this approach is applied in the design of two HVDC modulation controllers in China Southern Grid, and the results demonstrate the advantages.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385826","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275592.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Coordinate Design of Multiple HVDC Modulation Controllers based on MIMO System Identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275592/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Coordinate Design of Multiple HVDC Modulation Controllers based on MIMO System Identification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10300765","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275592/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Coordinate Design of Multiple HVDC Modulation Controllers based on MIMO System Identification","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051226S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275613,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The presented optimization approach to choosing such systems and their operating schedules uses Berkeley Lab's Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model [DER-CAM], extended to incorporate electrical storage options. DER-CAM chooses annual energy bill minimizing systems in a fully technology-neutral manner. An illustrative example for a San Francisco hotel is reported. The chosen system includes two engines and an absorption chiller, providing an estimated 11% cost savings and 10% carbon emission reductions, under idealized circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.385847","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.385847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Technology Selection and Operation of Microgrids in Commercial Buildings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Technology Selection and Operation of Microgrids in Commercial Buildings","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275613/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10300783","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4275613/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Technology Selection and Operation of Microgrids in Commercial Buildings","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107699S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275623,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Seung Lee","affiliation":["Korea Electrical Engineering and Science Research Institute (KESRI), Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Sang-Seung Lee was born in Goseong, Gyeongnam, Korea on April 2, 1960.

Recently, in the energy storage field, countries with CAES have developed small, medium and large units for storage roles. These units can be used for the dual-purpose applications of supplementary power generation and district heating supply systems. These units have an underground cavern or a modular-type pressurized vessel with large and small, micro containers.

The adaptive controller can achieve a desired damping effect without model-identification when the operating condition is changed. Numerical simulations of a real bulk power system and experimental results using real time digital simulator (RTDS) are presented to show its effectiveness.

The IMO is a merit order enhanced by a heuristic search algorithm based on average production cost of units, and the ALHN is a continuous Hopfield network with its energy function based on augmented Lagrangian relaxation. In the proposed method, IMO is used for solving unit scheduling and repairing constraint violations such as minimum up/down time, ramp rate, transmission limit, and 15 minute spinning reserve response time, and ALHN is applied for solving economic dispatch based on the obtained unit scheduling by the IMO. The proposed IMO-ALHN is tested on 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System with 26 units and compared to dynamic priority list (DPL), enhanced adaptive Lagrangian relaxation (ELR), and advanced hybrid genetic algorithm (AHGA). The results show that the proposed method obtains less total costs than the others.

It plays an important role in power system planning and operation, risk assessment and other decision making. This paper provides a method for predicting hourly prices in the day-ahead electricity market using recursive neural network (RNN) technique, which is based on similar days approach. RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts.

The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PSS design approach has been tested based on a three-machine system. A comparison between the proposed approach and a conventional sensitivity-based PSS design method is conducted by nonlinear time domain simulation and the results show the effectiveness of proposed approach.

These motors can realize magnetic suspension of rotor shafts by themselves without mechanical contacts or lubrication. However, these motors cannot generate suspension force effectively, because suspension flux necessary for generating suspension force passes through permanent magnets which have large magnetic reluctance. Accordingly, a novel deeply-buried permanent magnet type bearingless motor with 2- pole motor windings and 4-pole suspension windings has been proposed by the principal authors. In the proposed motor, the suspension flux does not pass through the permanent magnets. Thus, it was shown that the proposed motor can generate suspension force effectively in previous papers. In addition, it was confirmed experimentally that the proposed motor has the desired characteristic of high total efficiency considering suspension input power at rated speed. However, irrespective of the proposed motor, no studies have ever tried to make clear the total efficiency of the bearingless motors in wide speed range to the authors' knowledge. Therefore, this paper introduces the total efficiency of the proposed motor in the wide speed range, along with loading test results of a prototype motor.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Magnetic levitation","Reluctance motors","Synchronous motors","Reluctance generators","Rotors","Shafts","Lubrication","Magnetic flux","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine testing","machine windings","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motor","bearingless motor","2-pole motor windings","4-pole suspension windings","permanent magnet synchronous motors","magnetic bearings","rotor shafts","magnetic suspension","loading tests","total efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficient motor","bearingless motors","magnetic suspension","total efficiency","efficiency map"]}],"publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275875.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.386109","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.386109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total Efficiency of a Deeply Buried Permanent Magnet Type Bearingless Motor Equipped with 2-pole Motor Windings and 4-pole Suspension Windings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275875/","displayDocTitle":"Total Efficiency of a Deeply Buried Permanent Magnet Type Bearingless Motor Equipped with 2-pole Motor Windings and 4-pole Suspension Windings","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10300995","htmlLink":"/document/4275875/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total Efficiency of a Deeply Buried Permanent Magnet Type Bearingless Motor Equipped with 2-pole Motor Windings and 4-pole Suspension Windings","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107743S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4275890,"authors":[{"name":"Clodomiro Unsihuay","firstName":"Clodomiro","lastName":"Unsihuay","id":"37271666200"},{"name":"J.

Case studies are presented integrating the IEEE-14 test system and Belgian calorific gas network. The integrated electricity-gas optimal power flow problem is solved using an hybrid approach which combines evolutionary strategy algorithm with Newton's and Interior point method. It hybrid approach fully takes the advantages of both evolutionary strategy optimization and classical methods (such as Newton's and interior point method) which the former is able to jump out of the local optimal point and the latter boats the local exploration ability within the neighborhood of the optimal. It increases the precision and quickens the convergence. The proposed model shows the importance of the integration of the two systems in terms of operation, planning, security and reliability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the Integrated Natural Gas and Electricity Optimal Power Flow","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.386124","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275890.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.386124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the Integrated Natural Gas and Electricity Optimal Power Flow","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275890/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10301009","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the Integrated Natural Gas and Electricity Optimal Power Flow","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101861S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4275896,"authors":[{"name":"Donald J.

However, these data are not always available particularly in isolated sites due to the non-availability of the meteorological stations in these sites. Fortunately, the mean temperature and the sunshine duration are always available because we can measure these parameters using a simple instrument. This paper introduces a new approach for predicting and modelling of total solar radiation data from only the mean sunshine duration and air temperature using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference scheme (ANFIS). This technique is suitable for time series prediction. In this study a database of daily sunshine duration, ambient temperature and total solar radiation data, which had been recorded for 10-years (1981-1990) are used. An ANFIS model has been trained based on 9-years known data from the database a set of 365 values of solar radiation data is used for testing the model. In this way, the network was trained to accept and even handle a number of unusual cases. Known data were subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of the prediction. Subsequently, the unknown validation data set produced very accurate estimation, with the mean relative error (REM) not exceeding 1% between the actual and predicted data, and the correlation coefficient obtained for the validation data set is 98%. This model has been developed for Algiers location but the methodology can be applied to any geographical area in the world.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.386131","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04275897.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.386131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ANFIS-based Forecasting for Solar Radiation Data from Sunshine Duration and Ambient Temperature","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solar radiation","Temperature","Databases","Weather forecasting","Renewable energy resources","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Meteorology","Instruments","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","correlation methods","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","learning (artificial intelligence)","photovoltaic power systems","power engineering computing","solar power","sunlight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solar radiation forecasting","sunshine duration","renewable energy","photovoltaic power system","mean relative error","correlation coefficient","Algiers location","adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference scheme","ANFIS training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar radiation","Neural networks","Neuro-fuzzy","prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"An ANFIS-based Forecasting for Solar Radiation Data from Sunshine Duration and Ambient Temperature","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10290991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ANFIS-based Forecasting for Solar Radiation Data from Sunshine Duration and Ambient Temperature","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05327S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4275905,"authors":[{"name":"Gerard Stenbakken","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Gerard Stenbakken (M'71) was born in Minnesota, U.S.A. on March 17, 1941.

We describe an algorithm for taking time-synchronized samples of single-phase voltage and current power signals and calculating their dynamic parameters, in particular the signal magnitude, phase, frequency, and rate of change of frequency that a PMU reports. PMUs must time stamp their values at periodic Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) markers called the update times. Thus, to provide a reference for PMU testing the sampled data can be fit to a model to define the value of a dynamic parameter at a specific time. The analysis model proposed in this paper assumes that the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters of the signals are constant over the sampling interval analyzed. This analysis interval is usually the same as the update period or an integer multiple of that period. In the proposed analysis model the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters are considered a polynomial in time about the update times. The order of the polynomial can be adjusted in a way that meets the needs of the signal being analyzed, yet minimizes the computational effort and sensitivity to noise. We show that when the dynamic variations are analyzed in this way, a single matrix can be used to iteratively converge on a good estimate of the dynamic frequency and magnitude parameters. The polynomial model can be used to generate and analyze test signals. Several test patterns are proposed, which include linearly changing magnitudes or frequencies. As expected, during low voltage tests of the system, the analysis does very well when the generation model matches the analysis model. Several other generation models are also proposed, such as sine waves or damped sine waves. The proposed analysis model is shown to be very accurate in these cases as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4275905/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10301021","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4275905/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Phasor Measurement Unit Test System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Phasor Measurement Unit Test System","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068664S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4275905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4275909,"authors":[{"name":"Pinak Tulpule","affiliation":["Advanced Power and Electricity Research Center (APERC), West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Pinak","lastName":"Tulpule","id":"37572564300"},{"name":"Ali Feliachi","affiliation":["Advanced Power and Electricity Research Center (APERC), West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Feliachi","id":"37265819500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1296-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1298-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"}],"articleNumber":"4275909","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4275909","abstract":"This paper provides a new method to improve power system stability using recurrent neural network with adaptive training parameters.

Therefore these control parameters are often fixed and are set for particular system configurations or operating points. Artificial neural network can be tuned for changing system conditions and thus provide better control. Artificial neural network is used in this paper in parallel with the existing PSS to effectively damp the oscillations and improve overall system performance.

A remote community in Canada is used as the study system, for which a medium penetration wind power plant has been integrated into a system served by a diesel plant with three equally sized diesel generators. Based on field observations and monitored data for almost two years of operation, an energy-flow model is developed which incorporates operating constraints and control requirements of the autonomous wind- diesel system. The model is employed to analyze the interaction of wind and diesel power plants in order to identify alternative unit sizing approaches that improve wind-energy absorption rate of the wind plant, fuel savings and overall efficiency of the diesel plant. Optimization criteria for unit sizing of the diesel plant in the presence of the wind farm are discussed and system performance for several configurations based on multiple units with reduced-size diesel unit are investigated. The simulation results from the energy-flow model for two operation scenarios are compared with the field observations and an optimum combination of multiple diesels with reduced-size units is suggested.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.386275","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04276041.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.386275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diesel Plant Sizing and Performance Analysis of a Remote Wind-Diesel Microgrid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276041/","displayDocTitle":"Diesel Plant Sizing and Performance Analysis of a Remote Wind-Diesel Microgrid","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10301130","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276041/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diesel Plant Sizing and Performance Analysis of a Remote Wind-Diesel Microgrid","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049437S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4276041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276055,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37599960600"},{"name":"Frank Lambert","affiliation":["NEETRAC, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Lambert","id":"37298885100"},{"name":"Deepak Divan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Divan","id":"37272898300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1296-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1298-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"}],"articleNumber":"4276055","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Intelligent sensors","Costs","Computerized monitoring","Power grids","Substations","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Surveillance","Computer networks","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensors","electricity supply industry","power system measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor network","power delivery system","asset utilization optimization","T&D industry","distributed sensor network","utility asset status monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power delivery systems","Sensor networks","distributed monitoring","sensing","monitoring","communications"]}],"abstract":"The task of monitoring asset status and optimizing asset utilization for the T&D industry, given millions of assets and hundreds of thousands of miles of power lines distributed geographically over millions of square miles, seems particularly challenging if not impossible. Given the traditionally high cost of sensing and communications, the grid has minimal 'smarts' with much of the intelligence located at major substations. Dramatic reductions in sensor, computing and communications costs, coupled with significant performance enhancements has raised the possibility of realizing widely and massively distributed sensor networks (SNs) to monitor utility asset status. Under NEETRAC funding, a survey was conducted to review existing sensor technologies and products, and to estimate the possibility of extending these to realize distributed SNs. Possible applications for such SNs were also explored, as was the issue of cost point at which such networks would become commercially viable. This paper provides an overview of the highlights from the detailed survey that was conducted, and identifies 'gaps' in currently available sensor technologies, both from a performance and cost point.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2007.386289","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275198/4275199/04276055.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2007.386289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4275199","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Technologies for Implementing Sensor Networks for Power Delivery Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Technologies for Implementing Sensor Networks for Power Delivery Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276055/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10301144","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4276055/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Technologies for Implementing Sensor Networks for Power Delivery Systems","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"PES-00-856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082464S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4275198","isNumber":"4275199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4275198","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4275199","articleId":"4276055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4276297,"authors":[{"name":"Leo Freitas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Freitas","id":"37925561500"},{"name":"Zheng Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Fu","id":"37928486700"},{"name":"Jim Woodcock","affiliation":["University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Woodcock","id":"37272514700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2895-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4276297","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer industry","Software tools","Banking","Application software","Concrete","Programming","Hardware","Fault tolerance","File systems","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","formal specification","theorem proving","Unix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["verified software repository","POSIX-compliant file store","Z/Eves theorem prover","verified file store","space-flight mission","file store specification","UNIX filing system"]}],"abstract":"We present results from the second pilot project in the international Verification Grand Challenge: a formally verified specification of a POSIX-compliant file store using the Z/Eves theorem prover.

Applications to the Schmitt trigger circuit with controllable hysteresis and a window comparator are shown to demonstrate practical usages of the proposed circuit.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4276338/4276339/04276356.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"6th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS 2007)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2007.76","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2007.76","displayPublicationTitle":"6th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS 2007)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276356","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","CMOS logic circuits","Trigger circuits","Hysteresis","Threshold voltage","Circuit noise","Switches","Inverters","Power supplies","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","comparators (circuits)","hysteresis","threshold logic","trigger circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS","Schmitt trigger circuit","controllable hysteresis","logical threshold voltage control circuit","power supply voltage","window comparator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276356/","displayDocTitle":"CMOS Schmitt Trigger Circuit with Controllable Hysteresis Using Logical Threshold Voltage Control Circuit","accessionNumber":"9864106","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4276356/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS Schmitt Trigger Circuit with Controllable Hysteresis Using Logical Threshold Voltage Control Circuit","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"284100048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056169S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4276338","isNumber":"4276339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4276338","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4276339","articleId":"4276356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4276408,"authors":[{"name":"M.

But the EM algorithm is highly sensitive to initial values of model parameters and does not guarantee convergence to a global maximum resulting in non-optimized estimation for the HMM and lower recognition accuracy. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based EM learning method (GA-EHMM) for estimation of the HMM parameters. GA explores the search space more thoroughly than that of the EM algorithm and enables the EM to escape from many local maxima. A constraint-based approach of GA has been adopted in \"GA-EHMM\" which directs GA towards promising regions of the search space. Instead of generating the initial GA population randomly, a variable segmentation technique is used in the HMM initialization process. \"GA-EHMM\" has been tested on the TIMIT speech corpus. Experimental results show that \"GA- EHMM\" obtains better values for the likelihood function as well as higher recognition accuracy than that of the HMM model trained by the standard EM algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"6th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4276338/4276339/04276421.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"443","publicationTitle":"6th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2007.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2007.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Algorithm for Estimation of the Parameters of Hidden Markov Model based Acoustic Modeling of Speech Signals using Constraint-Based Genetic Algorithm and Expectation Maximization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Parameter estimation","Genetic algorithms","Automatic speech recognition","Speech recognition","Iterative algorithms","Informatics","Constraint optimization","Australia","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","expectation-maximisation algorithm","genetic algorithms","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","hidden Markov model based acoustic modeling","speech recognition","constraint-based genetic algorithm","expectation maximization","EM learning method","variable segmentation technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Algorithm for Estimation of the Parameters of Hidden Markov Model based Acoustic Modeling of Speech Signals using Constraint-Based Genetic Algorithm and Expectation Maximization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276421/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9864168","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Algorithm for Estimation of the Parameters of Hidden Markov Model based Acoustic Modeling of Speech Signals using Constraint-Based Genetic Algorithm and Expectation Maximization","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"284100438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051179S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4276338","isNumber":"4276339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4276338","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4276339","articleId":"4276421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4276434,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We also establish a necessary condition for any failure pattern to be ever recoverable, and show that the generalized pyramid codes are optimal in failure recovery (i.e., the necessary condition is also sufficient, and any failure pattern that is ever recoverable can indeed be recovered).","doi":"10.1109/NCA.2007.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCA.2007.37","publicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4276591/4276592/04276609.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pyramid Codes: Flexible Schemes to Trade Space for Access Efficiency in Reliable Data Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Pyramid Codes: Flexible Schemes to Trade Space for Access Efficiency in Reliable Data Storage Systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276609/","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9830631","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276609/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pyramid Codes: Flexible Schemes to Trade Space for Access Efficiency in Reliable Data Storage Systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"29220079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085609S","chronDate":"12-14 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4276591","isNumber":"4276592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4276591","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"4276592","articleId":"4276609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4276662,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Ming Su","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4276646/4276662/4276662-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guan-Ming Su (S'04\u2013M'07) received the B.S.E. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University in 1996 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He was with the Research and Development Department, Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, during the summer of 2005, and with ESS Technology, Fremont, CA, in 2006.

Unlike the traditional streaming video services, the strict delay constraints of an interactive video streaming system pose more challenges. These challenges include the heterogeneity of uplink and downlink channel conditions experienced by different users, the multiuser resource allocation of limited radio resources, the incorporation of the cross-layer design, and the diversity of content complexities exhibited by different video sequences. With the awareness of video content and network resources, the proposed system integrates cross-layer error protection mechanism and performs dynamic resource allocation across multiple users. We formulate the proposed system as to minimize the maximal end-to-end expected distortion received by all users, subject to maximal transmission power and delay constraints. To reduce the high dimensionality of the search space, fast multiuser algorithms are proposed to find the near-optimal solutions. Compared to the strategy without dynamically and jointly allocating bandwidth resource for uplinks and downlinks, the proposed framework outperforms by 2.18~7.95 dB in terms of the average received PSNR of all users and by 3.82~11.50 dB in terms of the lowest received PSNR among all users. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can provide more uniform video quality for all users and lower quality fluctuation for each received video sequence.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.901518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276646","startPage":"280","endPage":"294","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4276646/04276662.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.901518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Uplink and Downlink Optimization for Real-Time Multiuser Video Streaming Over WLANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Streaming media","Resource management","Delay","Video sequences","PSNR","Cross layer design","Power system protection","Bandwidth","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","image sequences","video streaming","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video quality","maximal end-to-end expected distortion","cross-layer error protection mechanism","video sequences","multiuser resource allocation","IEEE 802.11 networks","interactive multiuser communications","video streaming system","WLAN","real-time multiuser video streaming","downlink optimization","uplink optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer design","joint uplink and downlink optimization","multiuser video communication","network-aware","wireless local area networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Uplink and Downlink Optimization for Real-Time Multiuser Video Streaming Over WLANs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4276662/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9757345","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Uplink and Downlink Optimization for Real-Time Multiuser Video Streaming Over WLANs","sourcePdf":"01jstsp02-su.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093093S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4276646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4276646","articleId":"4276662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4276697,"authors":[{"name":"Sudheer S.

Our goal is to examine how many concepts would be needed, and how they should be selected and used. Simulating performance of video retrieval under different assumptions of concept detection accuracy, we find that good retrieval can be achieved even when detection accuracy is low, if sufficiently many concepts are combined. We also derive suggestions regarding the types of concepts that would be most helpful for a large concept lexicon. Since our user study finds that people cannot predict which concepts will help their query, we also suggest ways to find the best concepts to use. Ultimately, this paper concludes that \"concept-based\" video retrieval with fewer than 5000 concepts, detected with a minimal accuracy of 10% mean average precision is likely to provide high accuracy results in broadcast news retrieval.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2007.900150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4276700/04276711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2007.900150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276700","startPage":"958","endPage":"966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can High-Level Concepts Fill the Semantic Gap in Video Retrieval?

Images are labeled with respect to a vocabulary of visual concepts, as is usual in SR. Each image is then represented by a vector, referred to as a semantic multinomial, of posterior concept probabilities. Retrieval is based on the query-by-example paradigm: the user provides a query image, for which 1) a semantic multinomial is computed and 2) matched to those in the database. QBSE is shown to have two main properties of interest, one mostly practical and the other philosophical. From a practical standpoint, because it inherits the generalization ability of SR inside the space of known visual concepts (referred to as the semantic space) but performs much better outside of it, QBSE produces retrieval systems that are more accurate than what was previously possible. Philosophically, because it allows a direct comparison of visual and semantic representations under a common query paradigm, QBSE enables the design of experiments that explicitly test the value of semantic representations for image retrieval. An implementation of QBSE under the minimum probability of error (MPE) retrieval framework, previously applied with success to both QBVE and SR, is proposed, and used to demonstrate the two properties. In particular, an extensive objective comparison of QBSE with QBVE is presented, showing that the former significantly outperforms the latter both inside and outside the semantic space. By carefully controlling the structure of the semantic space, it is also shown that this improvement can only be attributed to the semantic nature of the representation on which QBSE is based.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2007.900138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4276700/04276715.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2007.900138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridging the Gap: Query by Semantic Example","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276715/","displayDocTitle":"Bridging the Gap: Query by Semantic Example","volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9613102","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276715/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridging the Gap: Query by Semantic Example","sourcePdf":"09tmm05-rasiwasia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108729S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4276700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"4276700","articleId":"4276715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4276731,"authors":[{"name":"Pingzhi Fan","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Pingzhi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37277801400"},{"name":"Weina Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weina","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37874845200"},{"name":"Yifeng Tu","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile Communications, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yifeng","lastName":"Tu","id":"37288793500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4276731","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":748},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary sequences","Autocorrelation","Infrared spectra","Acoustic pulses","Optical fiber communication","Spectroscopy","Acoustic applications","Acoustic devices","Radar applications","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Z-complementary binary sequences","complementary mates","zero correlation zone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary mates","Z-complementary binary sequences","zero correlation zone"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, Z-complementary sequences are introduced.

Specifically, we derive minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators of speech DFT coefficient magnitudes as well as of complex-valued DFT coefficients based on two classes of generalized gamma distributions, under an additive Gaussian noise assumption. The resulting generalized DFT magnitude estimator has as a special case the existing scheme based on a Rayleigh speech prior, while the complex DFT estimators generalize existing schemes based on Gaussian, Laplacian, and Gamma speech priors. Extensive simulation experiments with speech signals degraded by various additive noise sources verify that significant improvements are possible with the more recent estimators based on super-Gaussian priors. The increase in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) over the noisy signals is about 0.5 points for street noise and about 1 point for white noise, nearly independent of input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The assumptions made for deriving the complex DFT estimators are less accurate than those for the magnitude estimators, leading to a higher maximum achievable speech quality with the magnitude estimators.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation of Discrete Fourier Coefficients With Generalized Gamma Priors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.899233","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4276745/04276753.pdf","startPage":"1741","endPage":"1752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.899233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276745","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation of Discrete Fourier Coefficients With Generalized Gamma Priors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4276753/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608025","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation of Discrete Fourier Coefficients With Generalized Gamma Priors","sourcePdf":"15tasl06-erkelens.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097741S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4276745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4276745","articleId":"4276753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276755,"authors":[{"name":"Woojay Jeon","affiliation":["Motorola Laboratories, Center for Human Interaction Research, Schaumburg, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4276745/4276755/4276755-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Woojay Jeon (M'06) received the B.S. degree from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999 and the M.S. and Ph.D degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2002 and 2006, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He is a Senior Electrical Engineer at the Center for Human Interaction Research, Motorola Labs, Schaumburg, IL.

In this study, we adopt a computational model of the mammalian central auditory system and develop a methodology to analyze and interpret its behavior for an enhanced understanding of its end product, which is a data-redundant, dimension-expanded representation of neural firing rates in the primary auditory cortex (A1). Our first approach is to reinterpret the well-known Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) in the context of the auditory model. We then present a framework for interpreting the cortical response as a place-coding of speech information, and identify some key advantages of the model's dimension expansion. The framework consists of a model of ldquosourcerdquo-invariance that predicts how speech information is encoded in a class-dependent manner, and a model of ldquoenvironmentrdquo-invariance that predicts the noise-robustness of class-dependent signal-respondent neurons. The validity of these ideas are experimentally assessed under existing recognition framework by selecting features that demonstrate their effects and applying them in a conventional phoneme classification task. The results are quantitatively and qualitatively discussed, and our insights inspire future research on category-dependent features and speech classification using the auditory model.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.900102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4276745/04276755.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.900102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Analysis in a Model of the Central Auditory System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276755/","displayDocTitle":"Speech Analysis in a Model of the Central Auditory System","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608462","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276755/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Analysis in a Model of the Central Auditory System","sourcePdf":"15tasl06-jeon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101321S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4276745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4276745","articleId":"4276755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276760,"authors":[{"name":"Bertrand Mesot","affiliation":["IDIAP Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4276745/4276760/4276760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bertrand Mesot received the M.Sc. degree in computer science at the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.

Existing state-of-the-art solutions to this problem use feature-based HMMs, with a preprocessing stage to clean the noisy signal. However, the effect that raw signal noise has on the induced HMM features is poorly understood, and limits the performance of the HMM system. An alternative to feature-based HMMs is to model the raw signal, which has the potential advantage that including an explicit noise model is straightforward. Here we jointly model the dynamics of both the raw speech signal and the noise, using a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS). The new model was tested on isolated digit utterances corrupted by Gaussian noise. Contrary to the autoregressive HMM and its derivatives, which provides a model of uncorrupted raw speech, the SLDS is comparatively noise robust and also significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art feature-based HMM. The computational complexity of the SLDS scales exponentially with the length of the time series. To counter this we use expectation correction which provides a stable and accurate linear-time approximation for this important class of models, aiding their further application in acoustic modeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608079","htmlLink":"/document/4276760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Switching Linear Dynamical Systems for Noise Robust Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching Linear Dynamical Systems for Noise Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"15tasl06-mesot.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066452S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4276745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4276745","articleId":"4276760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4276763,"authors":[{"name":"Aarthi M.

Most algorithms that deal with this problem are based on masking, wherein unreliable frequency components from the mixed signal spectrogram are suppressed, and the reliable components are inverted to obtain the speech signal from speaker of interest. Most current techniques estimate this mask in a binary fashion, resulting in a hard mask. In this paper, we present two techniques to separate out the speech signal of the speaker of interest from a mixture of speech signals. One technique estimates all the spectral components of the desired speaker. The second technique estimates a soft mask that weights the frequency subbands of the mixed signal. In both cases, the speech signal of the speaker of interest is reconstructed from the complete spectral descriptions obtained. In their native form, these algorithms are computationally expensive. We also present fast factored approximations to the algorithms. Experiments reveal that the proposed algorithms can result in significant enhancement of individual speakers in mixed recordings, consistently achieving better performance than that obtained with hard binary masks.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.901310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276745","startPage":"1766","endPage":"1776","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4276745/04276763.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.901310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Mask Methods for Single-Channel Speaker Separation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loudspeakers","Frequency estimation","Humans","Ear","Signal processing","Computational modeling","Spectrogram","Speech coding","Speech recognition","Source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker recognition","speech enhancement","speech intelligibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft mask methods","single-channel speaker separation","speech signal extraction","signal spectrogram","speakers enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal separation","soft masks","speaker separation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Soft Mask Methods for Single-Channel Speaker Separation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4276763/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9729819","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Mask Methods for Single-Channel Speaker Separation","sourcePdf":"15tasl06-reddy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084964S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4276745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4276745","articleId":"4276763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4276772,"authors":[{"name":"Ray C.

To improve the overall system performance without increasing communication resources and complexity, this paper presents a cost-effective interconnect architecture, communication protocol, and signaling technology that exploits parallelism in board-level communication, resulting in shorter latency and higher concurrency on a shared bus or link: the proposed source synchronous CDMA interconnect (SSCDMA-I) enables dual concurrent transactions on a single wire line as well as flexible input/output (I/O) reconfiguration. The SSCDMA-I utilizes 2-bit orthogonal CDMA coding and a variation of source synchronous clocking for multilevel superposition; a single 3-level SSCDMA-I line operates as if it consists of dual virtual time-multiplexed interconnects, which exploits communication parallelism with a reduced number of pins, wires, and complexity. The unique multiple access capability of the SSCDMA-I improves real-time communication between multiple semiconductor intellectual property (IP) blocks on a shared link or bus by reducing the bus contention interference from simultaneous traffic requests and by taking advantage of shorter request latency. The prototype transceiver chip is implemented in 0.18-m CMOS and the 10-cm test PC board system achieves an aggregate data rate of 2.5 Gb/s/pin between four off-chip (2Tx-to-2Rx) I/Os.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4276770/04276781.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an Interconnect Architecture and Signaling Technology for Parallelism in Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276781/","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Interconnect Architecture and Signaling Technology for Parallelism in Communication","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9619963","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276781/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Interconnect Architecture and Signaling Technology for Parallelism in Communication","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi08-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128754S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4276770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4276770","articleId":"4276781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4276783,"authors":[{"name":"Valavan Manohararajah","affiliation":["Altera Toronto Technology Center, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4276770/4276783/4276783-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Valavan Manohararajah received the B.A.Sc., M.A.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 1998, 2001, and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Member of the Technical Staff with the Altera Toronto Technology Center, Toronto.

Industrial circuits and two industrial field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) architectures were used in this paper. We show that there is a large amount of inherent randomness in a state-of-the-art FPGA placement algorithm. Thus, it is impossible to predict interconnect delay with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, we show that a simple timing model can be used to predict some aspects of interconnect timing with just as much accuracy as predictions obtained by running the placement tool itself. Using this simple timing model in a two-phase timing driven physical synthesis flow can both improve quality of results and decrease runtime. Next, we present a metric for predicting the accuracy of our interconnect delay model and show how this metric can be used to reduce the runtime of a timing driven physical synthesis flow. Finally, we examine the benefits of using the simple timing model in a timing driven physical synthesis flow, and attempt to establish an upper bound on these possible gains, given the difficulty of interconnect delay prediction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Interconnect Delay for Physical Synthesis in a FPGA CAD Flow","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900744","startPage":"895","endPage":"903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4276770/04276783.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Interconnect Delay for Physical Synthesis in a FPGA CAD Flow","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276783/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9613169","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Interconnect Delay for Physical Synthesis in a FPGA CAD Flow","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi08-manohararajah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056296S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4276770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4276770","articleId":"4276783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276786,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Saldana","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Saldana","id":"37937873300"},{"name":"Lesley Shannon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Lesley","lastName":"Shannon","id":"37299243200"},{"name":"Jia Shuo Yue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jia Shuo","lastName":"Yue","id":"37931169500"},{"name":"Sikang Bian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sikang","lastName":"Bian","id":"37939471700"},{"name":"John Craig","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Craig","id":"37942317100"},{"name":"Paul Chow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Chow","id":"37266119000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4276786","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":308},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"A fundamental difference between application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is that the wires in ASICs are designed to match the requirements of a particular design. Conversely, in an FPGA, the area is fixed and the routing resources exist whether or not they are used. In this paper, we investigate how well several common network topologies map onto a modern FPGA routing fabric. Different multiprocessor network topologies with between 8 and 64 nodes are mapped to a single large FPGA. Except for the fully-connected networks, it is observed that the difference in logic resources used and routing overhead among these topologies is insignificant for the systems tested. Fully-connected networks up to about 22 nodes are also feasible on the same FPGA although the logic and routing utilization clearly grows much faster. The conclusion is that a modern FPGA fabric is very rich in resources and capable of supporting highly interconnected topologies. For systems with a modest number of nodes implemented on current large FPGAs, it is not necessary to use the connectivity-limited topologies typically used for networks-on-chip. Rather, direct point-to-point connections between all communicating nodes can be considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4276770/04276786.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routability of Network Topologies in FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit interconnections","Routing","Entropy","Switches","Wire","Fabrics","Logic testing","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network topologies","application-specific integrated circuits","field-programmable gate arrays","routing utilization","networks-on-chip","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer networks","field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","multiprocessor interconnection","reconfigurable architectures","topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Routability of Network Topologies in FPGAs","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276786/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9613171","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routability of Network Topologies in FPGAs","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi08-saldana-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044322S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4276770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4276770","articleId":"4276786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276787,"authors":[{"name":"Vassos Soteriou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4276770/4276787/4276787-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vassos Soteriou (S'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Rice University, Houston, TX, in 2001.

In these systems, the increasing on-chip communication demand among the computation elements necessitates the use of scalable, high-bandwidth network-on-chip (NoC) fabrics instead of dedicated interconnects and shared buses. As transistor feature sizes are further miniaturized, more complicated NoC architectures become feasible that can support more demanding applications. Given the myriad emerging software-hardware combinations, for cost-effectiveness, a system designer critically needs to prune this widening NoC design-space to predict the interconnect fabric(s) that best balance(s) cost/performance, before the actual design process begins. This prompted us to develop Polaris, a system-level roadmapping toolchain for on-chip interconnection networks that helps designers predict the most suitable interconnection network design(s) tailored to their performance needs and power/silicon area constraints with respect to a range of applications that the system will run. Polaris explores the plethora of NoC designs based on projections of network traffic, architectures, and process characteristics. While Polaris's toolchain is extensible so new traffic, network designs, and technology processes can be added, the current version already incorporates 7872 NoC design points. Polaris is rapid, efficiently iterating over thousands of NoC design points, while maintaining high relative and absolute accuracies when validated against detailed NoC synthesis results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4276770/04276787.pdf","startPage":"855","endPage":"868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.900725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polaris: A System-Level Roadmapping Toolchain for On-Chip Interconnection Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","System-on-a-chip","Network-on-a-chip","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Computer architecture","Process design","Telecommunication traffic","Multiprocessing systems","Computer networks","Fabrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor interconnection networks","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Polaris","system-level roadmapping","on-chip interconnection network","multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip","chip multiprocessor","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interconnection networks","networks-on-chip (NoCs)","roadmap","simulation","software tools"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Polaris: A System-Level Roadmapping Toolchain for On-Chip Interconnection Networks","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276787/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9609971","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polaris: A System-Level Roadmapping Toolchain for On-Chip Interconnection Networks","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi08-soteriou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087116S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4276770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4276770","articleId":"4276787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4276814,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Takami Ohta","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4276790/4276814/4276814-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aaron Takami Ohta (S'99) received the B.S. degree from the University of Hawaii, Manoa, in 2003, and the M.S. degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2004, both in electrical engineering.

The method is intended for applications that require decoupling of subsystem process flows to simplify device fabrication in order to attain macro three-dimensionality, or for cases where the device requires spatially referenced macro- and microfeatures with good precision. The design considerations for the deflection springs are presented, and a simple reduced-order model of the expected elastic behavior is proposed. The assembly concept is demonstrated with an electrospray array test structure. This test structure assembles perpendicularly two wafer substrates. The performance of the test structure is benchmarked using finite-element simulations and by measurements of the misalignment introduced by the assembly.

The pull-in instability that results in a system collision with an electrode substrate may lead to a system failure and, thus, limits the system maximum displacement. The beam/plate structure with a flat initial configuration under an electrostatic loading can only experience the pull-in instability. With the different arch configurations, the structure may experience either only the pull-in instability or the snap-through and pull-in instabilities together. As shown in our computation and experiment, those arch-shaped beams with the snap-through instability have the larger maximum displacement compared with the arch-shaped beams with only the pull-in stability and those with the flat initial configuration. The snap-through occurs by exerting a fixed load, and the structure experiences a discontinuous displacement jump without consuming power. Furthermore, after the snap-through jump, the structures are demonstrated to have the capacity to withstand further electrostatic loading without pull-in. Those properties of consuming no power and increasing the structure deflection range without pull-in is very useful in microelectromechanical systems design, which can offer better sensitivity and tuning range.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4276790/04276827.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"693","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2007.897090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2007.897090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Snap-Through and Pull-In Instabilities of an Arch-Shaped Beam Under an Electrostatic Loading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laboratories","Stability","Fabrication","Microelectronics","Instruments","Springs","Electrodes","Microelectromechanical systems","Electrostatic analysis","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrodes","micromechanical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic loading","arch-shaped beam","pull-in instabilities","snap-through instabilities","system maximum displacement","electrode substrate","system collision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Actuators","beams","electrostatic analysis","modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Snap-Through and Pull-In Instabilities of an Arch-Shaped Beam Under an Electrostatic Loading","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4276827/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9744212","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Snap-Through and Pull-In Instabilities of an Arch-Shaped Beam Under an Electrostatic Loading","sourcePdf":"16jmems03-yzhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08642S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4276790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4276790","articleId":"4276827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4276835,"authors":[{"name":"Masato Yoshida","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Miyagi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/4268356/4276835/4276835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masato Yoshida was born in Toyama, Japan, on January 25, 1975.

The system consists of a linear array of resistive-vee antennas, microwave switches, a vector network analyzer, and a 3-D positioner, all under computer control. The array has two transmitters and four receivers which provide eight bistatic spacings from 12 to 96 cm in 12-cm increments. Buried targets are scanned with and without surface clutter, which is a layer of rocks whose spacing is empirically chosen to maximize the clutter effect. The measured responses are calibrated so that the direct coupling in the system is removed, and the signal reference point is located at the antenna drive point.

The mechanisms are canopy scatter from a reciprocal medium with azimuthal symmetry and a ground scatter term that can represent double-bounce scatter from a pair of orthogonal surfaces with different dielectric constants or Bragg scatter from a moderately rough surface, which is seen through a layer of vertically oriented scatterers. The model is shown to represent the behavior of polarimetric backscatter from a tropical forest and two temperate forest sites by applying it to data from the National Aeronautic and Space Agency/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) system. Scattering contributions from the two basic scattering mechanisms are estimated for clusters of pixels in polarimetric SAR images. The solution involves the estimation of four parameters from four separate equations. This model fit approach is justified as a simplification of more complicated scattering models, which require many inputs to solve the forward scattering problem. The model is used to develop an understanding of the ground-trunk double-bounce scattering that is present in the data, which is seen to vary considerably as a function of incidence angle. Two parameters in the model fit appear to exhibit sensitivity to vegetation canopy structure, which is worth further exploration. Results from the model fit for the ground scattering term are compared with estimates from a forward model and shown to be in good agreement. The behavior of the scattering from the ground-trunk interaction is consistent with the presence of a pseudo-Brewster angle effect for the air-trunk scattering interface. If the Brewster angle is known, it is possible to directly estimate the real part of the dielectric constant of the trunks, a key variable in forward modeling of backscatter from forests. It is also shown how, with a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">priori</i>\n knowledge of the forest height, an estimate for the attenuation coefficient of the canopy can be obtained directly from the multi-incidence-angle polarimetric observations. This attenuation coefficient is another key variable in forward models and is generally related to the canopy density.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","volume":"45","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"9613117","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276884/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fitting a Two-Component Scattering Model to Polarimetric SAR Data From Forests","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fitting a Two-Component Scattering Model to Polarimetric SAR Data From Forests","sourcePdf":"45tgrs08-freeman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049162S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","isNumber":"4276872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"135","articleId":"4276884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4276898,"authors":[{"name":"Carey M.

The waves radiated initially in air can be approximated as circular, but once they enter the soil half-space, they propagate with a wavefront shape that resembles a hyperbola.

In particular, the problem of localizing the interfaces of a slab hidden behind an obstacle, another slab whose electromagnetic features and thickness are known, is considered. To this end, an approximate linear mathematical relationship between the scattered field and the unknown slab-interface positions is stated. Such an approximate relationship arises from neglecting the multiple-reflections between the two unknown slab's interfaces and between the slab and the obstacle. The unknown locations of the slab's interfaces are represented as the support of Dirac-delta functions, and the problem is cast as the inversion of a linear integral operator whose inversion is achieved by means of the Truncated-Singular-Value-Decomposition (TSVD) inversion scheme. The effect of the parameters of the obstacle on the inversion algorithm and the performances achievable by the solution approach are assessed by exploiting synthetic data. Furthermore, a comparison with the reconstructions obtained under the Born approximation and with the time-backscattered field is achieved. Finally, results obtained by employing experimental data collected owing to a stepped-frequency ground-penetrating radar system are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.900994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4276872/04276903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.900994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276872","startPage":"2471","endPage":"2482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of the Interfaces of a Slab Hidden Behind a Wall","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Localization of the Interfaces of a Slab Hidden Behind a Wall","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9613120","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4276903/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of the Interfaces of a Slab Hidden Behind a Wall","sourcePdf":"45tgrs08-soldovieri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094418S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4276872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4276872","articleId":"4276903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276906,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph N.

Space-time block codes built from generalized complex orthogonal designs are particularly attractive because the orthogonality permits a simple decoupled maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm while achieving full transmit diversity. The two main research problems for these complex orthogonal space-time block codes (COSTBCs) have been to determine for any number of antennas the maximum rate and the minimum decoding delay for a maximum rate code. The maximum rate for COSTBCs was determined by Liang in 2003. This paper addresses the second fundamental problem by providing a tight lower bound on the decoding delay for maximum rate codes. It is shown that for a maximum rate COSTBC for 2m - 1 or 2m antennas, a tight lower bound on decoding delay is r = (\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m-1</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2m</sup>\n) . This lower bound on decoding delay is achievable when the number of antennas is congruent to 0, 1, or 3 modulo 4. This paper also derives a tight lower bound on the number of variables required to construct a maximum rate COSTBC for any given number of antennas. Furthermore, it is shown that if a maximum rate COSTBC has a decoding delay of r where r < r les 2r, then r=2r. This is used to provide evidence that when the number of antennas is congruent to 2 modulo 4, the best achievable decoding delay is 2(\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m-1</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2m_</sup>\n).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4276908/04276909.pdf","startPage":"2677","endPage":"2684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.901174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.901174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Minimum Decoding Delay of Maximum Rate Complex Orthogonal Space\u2013Time Block Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Block codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO","Fading","Algorithm design and analysis","Employee welfare","Joining materials","Mathematics","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna theory","block codes","maximum likelihood decoding","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum decoding delay","maximum rate complex orthogonal space-time block codes","generalized complex orthogonal designs","maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm","full transmit diversity","maximum rate codes","tight lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized complex orthogonal design (GCOD)","maximum rate","minimum decoding delay","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","space\u2013time block code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Minimum Decoding Delay of Maximum Rate Complex Orthogonal Space\u2013Time Block Codes","volume":"53","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276909/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9613078","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Minimum Decoding Delay of Maximum Rate Complex Orthogonal Space\u2013Time Block Codes","sourcePdf":"53tit08-adams.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076591S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4276908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4276908","articleId":"4276909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4276910,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Bekir","affiliation":["Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne, Canoga Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Bekir","id":"37939017600"},{"name":"Solomon W.

Moreover, the techniques presented here extend to yield lower bounds for channels with certain types of random insertions, namely, duplications, or combinations of duplications and deletions. To demonstrate these techniques in this context, two binary channels are analyzed: a channel where each transmitted bit is copied with probability nu and a channel where each transmitted bit is copied a geometrically distributed number of times.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4276908/04276917.pdf","startPage":"2693","endPage":"2714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Lower Bounds for the Capacity of i.i.d.

It is demonstrated that power control based on the feedback is instrumental in achieving the D-M tradeoff, and that rate adaptation is important in obtaining a high diversity gain even at high rates. A criterion to determine finite-length codes to be tradeoff optimal is presented, leading to a useful geometric characterization of the class of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">extended approximately universal codes</i>\n.

Finally, lower bounds to the optimal D-M tradeoffs based on Gaussian coding arguments are also studied. In contrast to the no-feedback case, these random coding bounds are only asymptotically tight, but can quickly approach the optimal tradeoff even with moderate codeword lengths.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.901171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.901171","startPage":"2743","endPage":"2759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4276908/04276925.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity\u2013Multiplexing Tradeoff in MIMO Channels With Partial CSIT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Diversity\u2013Multiplexing Tradeoff in MIMO Channels With Partial CSIT","volume":"53","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9618577","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4276925/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity\u2013Multiplexing Tradeoff in MIMO Channels With Partial CSIT","sourcePdf":"53tit08-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127045S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4276908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4276908","articleId":"4276925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4276926,"authors":[{"name":"Sunghwan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37335999000"},{"name":"Jong-Seon No","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Seon","lastName":"No","id":"37266106800"},{"name":"Habong Chung","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Hongik University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Habong","lastName":"Chung","id":"37335688400"},{"name":"Dong-Joon Shin","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Joon","lastName":"Shin","id":"37274958000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4276926","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":841},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276926","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","AWGN","Reed-Solomon codes","Code standards","Error probability","Information theory","Australia","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes","protograph code","circulant permutation matrices","subgraph patterns","combinatorial construction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Girth","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","protograph","protograph codes","quasi--cyclic (QC) codes"]}],"abstract":"A quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) code can be viewed as the protograph code with circulant permutation matrices (or circulants).

This work addresses the question of how to evaluate and compare classifiers in the NP setting. Simply reporting false positives and false negatives leaves some ambiguity about which classifier is best. Unlike conventional classification, however, there is no natural performance measure for NP classification. We cannot reject classifiers whose false positive rate exceeds a since, among other reasons, the false positive rate must be estimated from data and hence is not known with certainty. We propose two families of performance measures for evaluating and comparing classifiers and suggest one criterion in particular for practical use. We then present general learning rules that satisfy performance guarantees with respect to these criteria. As in conventional classification, the notion of uniform convergence plays a central role, and leads to finite sample bounds, oracle inequalities, consistency, and rates of convergence. The proposed performance measures are also applicable to the problem of anomaly prediction.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.901152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4276908/04276935.pdf","startPage":"2852","endPage":"2863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.901152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Measures for Neyman\u2013Pearson Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Measures for Neyman\u2013Pearson Classification","volume":"53","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9623664","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276935/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276935/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Measures for Neyman\u2013Pearson Classification","sourcePdf":"53tit08-scott.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090069S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4276908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4276908","articleId":"4276935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276936,"authors":[{"name":"Brooke Shrader","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Brooke","lastName":"Shrader","id":"37300947000"},{"name":"Anthony Ephremides","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ephremides","id":"37265761500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4276936","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276936","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Stability analysis","Throughput","Government","Collaborative work","Wireless networks","Access protocols","Queueing analysis","Unicast","Terrorism"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","broadcast channels","queueing theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random access broadcast","throughput analysis","stability analysis","wireless network","random access protocol","interacting queues networks","broadcast service process","packet capture","multipacket reception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ALOHA","multipacket reception","random access","queueing","stability","throughput","wireless broadcast"]}],"abstract":"A wireless network in which packets are broadcast to a group of receivers through use of a random access protocol is considered in this work.

The broadcast service process is analyzed assuming a channel that allows for packet capture and multipacket reception. It is proved that the stability and throughput regions coincide in this small network. The same problem for a network with N sources and M destinations is considered next. The channel model is simplified in that packet capture and multipacket reception is no longer permitted. Bounds on the stability region are developed using the concept of stability rank and the throughput region of the system is compared to the bounds.

QKD systems and similar protocols use classical error-correcting codes for both error correction (for the honest parties to correct errors) and privacy amplification (to make an eavesdropper fully ignorant). From a coding perspective, a good model that corresponds to such a setting is the wire tap channel introduced by Wyner in 1975. In this correspondence, we study fundamental limits and coding methods for wire tap channels. We provide an alternative view of the proof for secrecy capacity of wire tap channels and show how capacity achieving codes can be used to achieve the secrecy capacity for any wiretap channel. We also consider binary erasure channel and binary symmetric channel special cases for the wiretap channel and propose specific practical codes. In some cases our designs achieve the secrecy capacity and in others the codes provide security at rates below secrecy capacity. For the special case of a noiseless main channel and binary erasure channel, we consider encoder and decoder design for codes achieving secrecy on the wiretap channel; we show that it is possible to construct linear-time decodable secrecy codes based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that achieve secrecy.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.901143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.901143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4276908/04276938.pdf","startPage":"2933","endPage":"2945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of LDPC Codes to the Wiretap Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Applications of LDPC Codes to the Wiretap Channel","volume":"53","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276938/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9605961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276938/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of LDPC Codes to the Wiretap Channel","sourcePdf":"53tit08-thangaraj-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18074S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4276908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"305","xplore-issue":"4276908","articleId":"4276938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4276942,"authors":[{"name":"Steven P.

The two underlying design mechanisms of such networks involve genetic optimization and information granulation (IG). The resulting constructs come in the form of fuzzy polynomial neural networks with fuzzy-set-based polynomial neurons, regarded as their generic processing elements. First, we introduce a comprehensive design methodology using which we determine the optimal structure of the FSPNNs. This methodology hinges on the extended group method of data handling and fuzzy-set-based rules. It concerns the optimization of the FSPNN-related parameters such as the number of input variables, the order of the polynomial, the number of membership functions, and a collection of a specific subset of input variables realized through the mechanism of genetic optimization. Second, the fuzzy rules used in the networks exploit a notion of information granules defined over a system's variables and formed through the process of IG. This granulation is realized with the aid of the hard C-means clustering algorithm. The performance of the network is quantified through experimentation in which we use a number of modeling benchmarks already experimented with in the realm of fuzzy or neurofuzzy modeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276950/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9619970","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4276950/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Optimization of Fuzzy Polynomial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Optimization of Fuzzy Polynomial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"54tie04-roh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118017S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4276950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4276954,"authors":[{"name":"Tuncer Can Aysal","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276954/4276954-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tuncer Can Aysal (S'05) received the B.E. degree (high honors) from Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Delaware, Newark, in 2007, both in electrical and computer engineering.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.

For instance, the Gaussian and Laplacian probability density functions are special cases of generalized Gaussian statistics. Moreover, the linear and median filtering structures are statistically related to the maximum likelihood estimates of location under Gaussian and Laplacian statistics, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the well-established statistical relationship between Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, showing that the random variable formed as the ratio of two independent Gaussian distributed random variables is Cauchy distributed. We also note that the Cauchy distribution is a member of the generalized Cauchy distribution family. Recently proposed myriad filtering is based on the maximum likelihood estimate of location under Cauchy statistics. An analogous relationship is formed here for the Laplacian statistics, as the ratio of Laplacian statistics yields the distribution referred here to as the Meridian. Interestingly, the Meridian distribution is also a member of the generalized Cauchy family. The maximum likelihood estimate under the obtained statistics is analyzed. Motivated by the maximum likelihood estimate under meridian statistics, meridian filtering is proposed. The analysis presented here indicates that the proposed filtering structure exhibits characteristics more robust than that of median and myriad filtering structures. The statistical and deterministic properties essential to signal processing applications of the meridian filter are given. The meridian filtering structure is extended to admit real-valued weights utilizing the sign coupling approach. Finally, simulations are performed to evaluate and compare the proposed meridian filtering structure performance to those of linear, median, and myriad filtering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4276954/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9619864","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Meridian Filtering for Robust Signal Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meridian Filtering for Robust Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-aysal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10017S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4276958,"authors":[{"name":"Saad Bouguezel","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Faculty of Engineering, Setif University, Setif, Algeria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276958/4276958-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saad Bouguezel received the Engineering degree in electronics (communication engineering) from Setif University, Setif, Algeria, in 1993, the Masters' degree in electronics (industrial control) from Batna University, Batna, Algeria, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2004.","From November 2004 to June 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, where he was a Research and Teaching Assistant from March 2002 to October 2004.

By deploying dynamic spectrum management (DSM) techniques and reducing excess crosstalk among users, a network operator can dramatically increase the data rates and service reach of broadband access. However, current DSM algorithms suffer from either substantial suboptimality in typical deployment scenarios or prohibitively high complexity due to centralized computation. This paper develops, analyzes, and simulates a new suite of DSM algorithms for DSL interference-channel models called autonomous spectrum balancing (ASB). The ASB algorithms utilize the concept of a \"reference line,\" which mimics a typical victim line in the interference channel. In ASB, each modem tries to minimize the harm it causes to the reference line under the constraint of achieving its own target data-rate. Since the reference line is based on the statistics of the entire network, rather than any specific knowledge of the binder a modem operates in, ASB can be implemented autonomously without the need for a centralized spectrum management center. ASB has a low complexity and simulations using a realistic simulator show that it achieves large performance gains over existing autonomous algorithms, coming close to the optimal rate region in some typical scenarios. Sufficient conditions for convergence of ASB are also proved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","volume":"55","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"9609828","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276960/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Spectrum Balancing for Digital Subscriber Lines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Spectrum Balancing for Digital Subscriber Lines","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-cendrillon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197755S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4276961,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yang Chen","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293085800"},{"name":"P.

Such mismatches can occur as a result of direction-of-arrival (DOA) errors, local scattering, near-far spatial signature mismatch, waveform distortion, source spreading, imperfectly calibrated arrays and distorted antenna shape. In this paper, an adaptive beamformer that is robust against the DOA mismatch is proposed. This method imposes two quadratic constraints such that the magnitude responses of two steering vectors exceed unity. Then, a diagonal loading method is used to force the magnitude responses at the arrival angles between these two steering vectors to exceed unity. Therefore, this method can always force the gains at a desired range of angles to exceed a constant level while suppressing the interferences and noise. A closed-form solution to the proposed minimization problem is introduced, and the diagonal loading factor can be computed systematically by a proposed algorithm. Numerical examples show that this method has excellent signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio performance and a complexity comparable to the standard MVDR beamformer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4276952/04276961.pdf","startPage":"4139","endPage":"4150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadratically Constrained Beamforming Robust Against Direction-of-Arrival Mismatch","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Robustness","Scattering","Antenna arrays","Directive antennas","Shape","Interference suppression","Noise level","Closed-form solution","Minimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","beam steering","direction-of-arrival estimation","interference suppression","iterative methods","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadratically constrained beamforming","direction-of-arrival mismatch","minimum variance distortionless response beamformer","adaptive beamformer","interference suppression","noise suppression","closed-form solution","minimization problem","diagonal loading factor","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capon beamformer","diagonal loading","direction-of-arrival (DOA) mismatch","minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer","robust beamforming","steering vector uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quadratically Constrained Beamforming Robust Against Direction-of-Arrival Mismatch","volume":"55","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607678","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadratically Constrained Beamforming Robust Against Direction-of-Arrival Mismatch","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073752S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"99","articleId":"4276961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276965,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Huyen Dam","affiliation":["Western Australian Telecommunications Research Institute and Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276965/4276965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hai Huyen Dam received the Bachelor's degree (Hons.) and the Ph.D. degree (Hons.) from Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia, in 1996 and 2001, respectively.","From 1999 to 2000, she was a Visiting Research Associate, spending one year at the Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden.

The proposed approach is based on the steepest descent algorithm suitable for constrained BSS problems, where the constraints are included to ease the permutation effects associated with the convolutive mixtures. In addition, the method is realized using a modified golden search method plus parabolic interpolation, and this allows the optimum step size to be determined with only a few calculations of the cost function. Evaluation of the proposed procedure in simulated environments and in a real room environment shows that the proposed method results in significantly faster convergence for the BSS when compared with a fixed step-size gradient-based algorithm. In addition, for blind signal extraction where only a main speech source is desired, a combined scheme consisting of the proposed BSS and a postprocessor, such as an adaptive noise canceller, offers impressive noise suppression levels while maintaining low-target signal distortion levels.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.894406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4276952/04276965.pdf","startPage":"4198","endPage":"4207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.894406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Signal Separation Using Steepest Descent Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276965/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Signal Separation Using Steepest Descent Method","volume":"55","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607679","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276965/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Signal Separation Using Steepest Descent Method","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-dam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066056S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4276971,"authors":[{"name":"Tryphon T.

It turns out that this problem also provides a prediction theoretic interpretation to the Itakura distortion measure, which relates to our metric. Geodesies and geodesic distances are characterized in closed form and, hence, the geodesic distance between two spectral density functions provides an explicit, intrinsic (pseudo)metric on the cone of density functions. Certain other distortion measures that involve generalized means of spectral density functions are shown to lead to the same Riemannian metric. Finally, an alternative Riemannian metric is introduced, which is motivated by an analogous problem involving smoothing instead of prediction.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276952","startPage":"3995","endPage":"4003","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4276952/04276971.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distances and Riemannian Metrics for Spectral Density Functions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Density functional theory","Distortion measurement","Level measurement","Random processes","Information geometry","Probability density function","Prediction theory","Geodesy","Density measurement","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential geometry","perturbation techniques","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Riemannian metrics","spectral density functions","differential-geometric structure","discrete-time random processes","information geometry","probability density functions","Fisher information metric","prediction theoretic interpretation","Itakura distortion measure","geodesic distances","explicit pseudometric","intrinsic pseudometric"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential structure","distortion measures","information geometry","metrics","spectral density functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Distances and Riemannian Metrics for Spectral Density Functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276971/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9606775","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distances and Riemannian Metrics for Spectral Density Functions","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-georgiou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086209S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276971","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4276973,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Hirabayashi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276973/4276973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Akira Hirabayashi (S'93\u2013M'95) was born in Nagoya, Japan, on February 2, 1971.

The requirement is that the reconstructed signal is indistinguishable from the input in the sense that it yields the exact same measurements. Such a system can be interpreted as an oblique projection onto a given reconstruction space. The standard formulation requires a one-to-one relationship between the input measurements and the reconstructed model. Unfortunately, this condition fails when the cross-correlation matrix between the analysis and reconstruction basis functions is not invertible; in particular, when there are less measurements than the number of reconstruction functions. In this paper, we propose an extension of consistent sampling that is applicable to those singular cases as well, and that yields a unique and well-defined solution. This solution also makes use of projection operators and has a geometric interpretation. The key idea is to exclude the null space of the sampling operator from the reconstruction space and to enforce consistency on its complement. We specify a class of consistent reconstruction algorithms corresponding to different choices of complementary reconstruction spaces. The formulation includes the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, as well as other potentially more interesting reconstructions that preserve certain preferential signals. In particular, we display solutions that preserve polynomials or sinusoids, and therefore perform well in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.895996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.895996","startPage":"4104","endPage":"4115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4276952/04276973.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistent Sampling and Signal Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Consistent Sampling and Signal Recovery","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","volume":"55","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276973/","accessionNumber":"9609829","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276973/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent Sampling and Signal Recovery","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-hirabayashi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069851S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4276977,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Lanucara","affiliation":["European Space Operation Centre, European Space Agency, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276977/4276977-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Lanucara received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering in 1994 from \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d University of Rome, Rome, Italy.","In 2000, he joined the Operations Department, European Space Agency (ESA), Darmstadt, Germany, as Ground Operations Manager.

Assuming that the data symbols are mapped into points of fixed signal constellations, a transceiver structure employing widely linear (WL) filters, rather than linear ones, is proposed in order to exploit the statistical redundancy of some constellations, i.e., the correlation between the signals and their conjugate version. WL filters linearly and independently process both the in-phase and the quadrature components of the input signals and, with a limited increase in the computational complexity, allows one to improve the system performances. It is shown that, by representing the basic system model in terms of in-phase and quadrature components, the proposed structure can be derived by utilizing the already existing procedure for the design of the linear transceiver according to the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion. The performances of the WL and linear transceivers are compared in terms of mean-square error, symbol error rate, and achieved multiplexing gain.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.895997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4276952/04276988.pdf","startPage":"4258","endPage":"4270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.895997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely Linear MMSE Transceivers for MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276988/","displayDocTitle":"Widely Linear MMSE Transceivers for MIMO Channels","volume":"55","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9613071","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4276988/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely Linear MMSE Transceivers for MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-sterle.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111425S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4276989,"authors":[{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276989/4276989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Petre Stoica (F'94) received the D.Sc. degree in automatic control from the Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest (BPI), Bucharest, Romania, in 1979 and an honorary doctorate degree in science from Uppsala University (UU), Uppsala, Sweden, in 1993.","He is a Professor of systems modeling with the Division of Systems and Control, the Department of Information Technology at UU.

This paper derives the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sampled monopulse radar data. It is worthwhile to know the limits of such procedures; and in addition to its role in delivering the measurement accuracies required by a target tracker, the CRLB reveals an estimator's efficiency. We interrogate the CRLB expressions for cases of interest. Of particular interest are the CRLB's implications on the number of targets localizable: assuming a sampling-period equal to a rectangular pulse's length, five targets can be isolated between two matched filter samples given that the target's signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are known. This reduced to three targets when the SNRs are not known, but the number of targets increases back to five (and beyond) when a dithered boresight strategy is used.

This can be attributed to the fundamental tradeoff between the value of information contained in a distributed set of measurements versus the energy costs of acquiring measurements, fusing them into the conditional probability density function (pdf) and transmitting the updated conditional pdf. Communications is commonly the highest contributor among these costs, typically by orders of magnitude. Failure to consider this tradeoff can significantly reduce the operational lifetime of a sensor network. While a variety of methods have been proposed that treat a subset of these issues, the approaches are indirect and usually consider at most a single time step. In the context of object tracking with a distributed sensor network, we propose an approximate dynamic programming approach that integrates the value of information and the cost of transmitting data over a rolling time horizon. We formulate this tradeoff as a dynamic program and use an approximation based on a linearization of the sensor model about a nominal trajectory to simultaneously find a tractable solution to the leader node selection problem and the sensor subset selection problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the resulting algorithm can provide similar estimation performance to that of the common most informative sensor selection method for a fraction of the communication cost.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4276952/04276992.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"4300","endPage":"4311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Dynamic Programming for Communication-Constrained Sensor Network Management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Dynamic Programming for Communication-Constrained Sensor Network Management","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276992/","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276992/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9609832","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Dynamic Programming for Communication-Constrained Sensor Network Management","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-williams.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071815S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4276993,"authors":[{"name":"Limin Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276993/4276993-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Limin Yu received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunications engineering and the M.Sc. degree in radio physics/underwater acoustic communications from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

Based on a wavelet-based broadband Doppler compensation structure, this paper presents the design and performance characterization of optimum receivers for this class of communication systems. The wavelet-based Doppler compensation structure takes account of the coexistence of multiple Doppler scales in a multipath/Doppler channel and captures the information carried by multiple scaled replicas of the transmitted signal rather than an estimation of an average Doppler as in conventional Doppler compensation schemes. The transmitted signal is recovered by the perfect reconstruction (PR) wavelet analysis filter bank (FB). We demonstrate that with rational orthogonal wavelet signaling, the proposed communication structure corresponds to a Lth-order diversity system, where L is the number of dominant transmission paths. Two receiver designs for pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signal transmission are presented. Both receiver designs are optimal under the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion for diversity combination and symbol detection. Good performance is achieved for both receivers in combating the Doppler effect and intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath while mitigating the channel noise. In particular, the second receiver design overcomes symbol timing sensitivities present in the first design at reasonable cost to performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276993/","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276993/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607682","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Receiver Design for Broadband Doppler Compensation in Multipath/Doppler Channels With Rational Orthogonal Wavelet Signaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Receiver Design for Broadband Doppler Compensation in Multipath/Doppler Channels With Rational Orthogonal Wavelet Signaling","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116001S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4276994,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Zhou","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4276952/4276994/4276994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Quan Zhou (S'03\u2013M'07) received the B.E. degree from Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 1998, the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, in 2006, all in electrical engineering.","From August 2006 to December 2006, he was an intern with Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, participating the projects of antenna selection in the IEEE 802.11n standard.

In this vein, we develop the information geometric identification (IGID) algorithm. The algorithm consists of iterative alternating projections on two sets of probability distributions (PDs); i.e., likelihood PDs and data empirical distributions. A Gaussian assumption on the source distribution permits a closed-form low-complexity solution for these projections. The method is applicable to a wide range of problems; however, in this paper, the emphasis is on semiblind identification of unknown parameters in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications system. It is shown by simulations that the performance of the algorithm [in terms of both estimation error and bit-error rate (BER)] is similar to that of the expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithm proposed previously by Aldana \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i>\n, but with a substantial improvement in computational speed, especially for large constellations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4276952/04276995.pdf","startPage":"3975","endPage":"3986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.896091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.896091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4276952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4276995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Information Geometric Approach to ML Estimation With Incomplete Data: Application to Semiblind MIMO Channel Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO","Iterative algorithms","Probability distribution","Signal processing algorithms","Information geometry","Stochastic processes","Bit error rate","Veins","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Gaussian distribution","geometry","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","stochastic processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiblind MIMO channel identification","stochastic maximum-likelihood estimation","information geometric identification algorithm","iterative alternating projections","probability distributions","Gaussian assumption","bit-error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Expectation-maximization algorithm","information geometry","maximum-likelihood estimation","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","semiblind identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4276995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Information Geometric Approach to ML Estimation With Incomplete Data: Application to Semiblind MIMO Channel Identification","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4276995/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607683","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Information Geometric Approach to ML Estimation With Incomplete Data: Application to Semiblind MIMO Channel Identification","sourcePdf":"55tsp08-zia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117416S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4276952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4276952","articleId":"4276995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4277030,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir G.

Different repetitions of (notionally) the same waveform are recorded at random time shifts and are interleaved in memory, resulting in an increase of the equivalent sampling frequency. This procedure requires substantial time, particularly if further averaging is required. In this paper, an approach that ensures accurate time shifts is presented for repeated waveform measurements. Operating two independent oscillators with related frequencies forms the accurate shifts. One of these is used to excite a waveform of interest repeatedly, and the other clocks the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This architecture was implemented using a commercial \"off-the-shelf\" field programmable gate array. Examples of experimental waveforms, which are sampled at 2160 MHz using an ADC that is clocked at 80 MHz, are presented. They are compared with the simulated and independently measured waveforms where appropriate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9618569","htmlLink":"/document/4277030/","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Digitizing of Repetitive Waveforms Using Accurate Interleaved Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Digitizing of Repetitive Waveforms Using Accurate Interleaved Sampling","sourcePdf":"56tim04-ivchenko.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058074S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4276996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4276996","articleId":"4277030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4277035,"authors":[{"name":"Mart Min","affiliation":["Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4276996/4277035/4277035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mart Min (M'96) was born in Tallinn, Estonia, on May 9, 1943.

Due to limited resolution and conversion rate of analog-to-digital converters and limited processing power of available digital processors and/or lack of energy resources, conventional discrete-Fourier-transform-based algorithms are not efficient in small medical devices. Knowing exactly the frequencies of carriers (and excitations), an energy-saving fast signal processing method can be developed and implemented. When sampling synchronously with a carrier, it is possible to minimize the complexity of calculations and to introduce a digital-to-analog feedback for enhancement of resolution by digitizing only the small variations between adjacent samples.

The technique is readily implemented using commercially available instruments, which makes it suitable for, e.g., production testing. The bandwidth extension technique is combined with coherent averaging of the measurements in order to simultaneously increase the bandwidth and dynamic range of the test bed. The errors in the obtained wideband signal are also estimated. The method is evaluated experimentally on a base station PA for the third-generation wideband code division multiple access system and on a Doherty amplifier. A tenfold increase in bandwidth to a total of 144 MHz and a more than 10-dB increase in dynamic range to 78 dB were obtained in practice. In addition, the obtained wideband signal is used for behavioral amplifier modeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4277054/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606770","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Technique to Extend the Bandwidth of an RF Power Amplifier Test Bed","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Technique to Extend the Bandwidth of an RF Power Amplifier Test Bed","sourcePdf":"56tim04-wisell.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065316S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4276996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4276996","articleId":"4277054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4277063,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Lai Joshua Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277063/4277063-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chong Lai Joshua Lam was born in Hong Kong in 1977.

System concepts, which either exploit channel knowledge at the transmitter or at the receiver, have been investigated. The approach, which exploits channel knowledge at the transmitter and at the receiver simultaneously, referred to as combined-equalization, is a new approach that targets a common optimization of data transmission and reception. In this paper, we introduce a unified analysis for optimally exploiting diversity. We apply this analysis exemplarily to MC-CDMA systems exploiting any of the aforementioned concepts. It should be noted that this analysis could be applied to numerous other systems that exploit diversity. The presented approach analytically derives the theoretical lower performance bounds for pre-, post-, and combined-equalization achievable with MC-CDMA in up- and downlink. This fundamental investigation of lower bounds will serve as a benchmark for future optimization of MC-CDMA in multiuser scenarios. Moreover, we exemplarily present multiuser performance results with combined-equalization for the uplink which approach the lower bound derived in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277065.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Analysis of Diversity Exploitation in Multicarrier CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Analysis of Diversity Exploitation in Multicarrier CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606825","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4277065/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Analysis of Diversity Exploitation in Multicarrier CDMA","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-cosovic-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061268S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4277066,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Cotae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277066/4277066-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul Cotae (S'95\u2013M'01\u2013SM'04) was born in Falticeni, Romania, on June 21, 1955.

The low spatial fading of UWB signals compared to NBI signals is exploited to provide \"interference selection diversity (SD).\" Whereas classical SD is designed to maximize the desired received signal power, the aim of interference SD is to minimize the effective NBI power. The resulting distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver is derived for both Rayleigh and Ricean NBI fading scenarios. Expressions for the probability of error of the SD scheme are also derived for a perfect receiver (where the correlator template is matched to the received UWB pulse shape) as well as for a Rake receiver with a limited number of fingers. It is shown that doubling the number of antennas results in a 3-dB performance improvement for the Rayleigh fading case. Less substantial gains are observed under Ricean fading. The method provides a simple but effective technique to mitigate NBI effects in UWB systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NBI Mitigation for UWB Systems Using Multiple Antenna Selection Diversity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277075.pdf","startPage":"2363","endPage":"2374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"NBI Mitigation for UWB Systems Using Multiple Antenna Selection Diversity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4277075/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NBI Mitigation for UWB Systems Using Multiple Antenna Selection Diversity","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-jibrahim-cr-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096131S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4277079,"authors":[{"name":"Insoo Koo","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Insoo","lastName":"Koo","id":"37275759800"},{"name":"Jeong Rok Yang","affiliation":["Korean Intellectual Property office, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong Rok","lastName":"Yang","id":"37440903500"},{"name":"Kiseon Kim","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kiseon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280247300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4277079","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Speech analysis","Multiaccess communication","Traffic control","Capacity planning","Performance analysis","Multimedia systems","Quality of service","Mobile communication","Web and internet services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Markov processes","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Erlang capacity analysis","CDMA systems","delay-tolerant data services","delay constraint","voice services","code- division multiple-access system","blocking probability","voice call","Markov model","first-come-first-serve service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","delay constraint","Erlang capacity","voice and data"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the Erlang capacity of a code-division multiple-access system supporting voice and delay-tolerant data services. The novelty here is to consider the characteristic of delay-tolerant traffic in terms of a delay confidence. The delay confidence is defined as the probability that a new data call is accepted within the maximum tolerable delay without being blocked. In this case, the Erlang capacity is confined not only by the required blocking probability of voice call but also by the required delay confidence of data call. For the performance analysis, we develop a 2-D Markov model, which is based on the First-Come- First-Serve service discipline, and further present a numerical procedure to analyze the Erlang capacity. According to the procedure, we can make a balance between the Erlang capacities with respect to the blocking probability of voice call and with respect to the delay confidence of data call, in order to accommodate extra Erlang capacity. We demonstrate the balancing by properly selecting the size of the designated queue for data traffic.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erlang Capacity Analysis of CDMA Systems Supporting Voice and Delay-Tolerant Data Services Under the Delay Constraint","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277079.pdf","startPage":"2375","endPage":"2385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Erlang Capacity Analysis of CDMA Systems Supporting Voice and Delay-Tolerant Data Services Under the Delay Constraint","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4277079/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9609888","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erlang Capacity Analysis of CDMA Systems Supporting Voice and Delay-Tolerant Data Services Under the Delay Constraint","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-koo-cr-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071216S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4277083,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-ching Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277083/4277083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuo-ching Liang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1999, the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2000, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 2003.

Alternatively, we show that serial or parallel interference cancellation can be used to drastically reduce the error floor. Simulations show that, depending on the SNR and the origin of the ICI, one of the schemes performs best. In all cases, our schemes lead to a drastic reduction of the bit error rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277085.pdf","startPage":"2158","endPage":"2167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Methods for Cancellation of Intercarrier Interference in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Interference cancellation","OFDM","Intersymbol interference","Frequency division multiplexing","Delay","Wireless LAN","Doppler shift","Linear systems","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","iterative methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","intercarrier interference cancellation","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","cyclic prefix","temporal variations","intersymbol interference","operator-perturbation technique","linear system inversion","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic prefix (CP)","intercarrier interference (ICI)","interference cancellation","intersymbol interference (ISI)","iterative algorithms","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Methods for Cancellation of Intercarrier Interference in OFDM Systems","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4277085/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606827","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Methods for Cancellation of Intercarrier Interference in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-molisch-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092296S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4277090,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Rummler","affiliation":["Accenture AG, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277090/4277090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert R\u00fcmmler (S'01\u2013M'04) received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from King's College London, University of London, London, U.K., in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","From 2001 to 2005, he was a Research Associate at the Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College London, University of London, and contributed to European research projects in the area of reconfigurability.

We evaluate the capacity of three channel selection strategies for one-to-many multicast over the WCDMA air interface in terms of outage probability. With the first scheme, dedicated or PTP traffic channels carry multicast data to individual users, whereas the second scheme relies on a single common or PTM channel for broadcasting multicast data within the entire cell. The third scheme finally combines the PTP and PTM approaches by transmitting a single PTM channel over the cell center while transmitting PTP channels to multicast users close to the cell boundary, allowing these users to benefit from macrodiversity gain and, in doing so, improving handover performance. We study the capacity of each of the three schemes by first deriving suitable outage probability expressions and then calculating the overall capacity, i.e., the number of multicast users that can be supported by each of the three schemes. Our comparative study gives insight into the tradeoffs between the three schemes under varying system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277090.pdf","startPage":"2180","endPage":"2193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity of Different Channel Selection Strategies for Multicast Transmissions in WCDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277090/","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of Different Channel Selection Strategies for Multicast Transmissions in WCDMA","volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607734","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4277090/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of Different Channel Selection Strategies for Multicast Transmissions in WCDMA","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-rummler-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128208S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4277091,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Sarris","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277091/4277091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Sarris received the B.Sc. degree (with honors) in computing and physics from the University of Brighton, Brighton, U.K., in 2000 and the M.Sc. degree in communications systems and signal processing from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 2001.

Under this scenario, the channel-response matrix is usually rank deficient due to the high correlation between the LoS responses. Previous studies have shown that this problem can be overcome by the use of specifically designed antenna arrays. The antenna elements are positioned to preserve orthogonality and, hence, maximize the LoS-channel rank. To help in the design of such architectures, we derive a 3-D criterion for maximizing the LoS MIMO capacity as a function of the distance, the orientation, and the spacing of the arrays. The sensitivity of these systems to imperfect positioning and orientation is examined using a geometric MIMO model. The spectral efficiency is also investigated in the presence of scattered signals in the environment using a stochastic channel model and a Monte Carlo simulator. To demonstrate the validity of our predictions, we present the results of two MIMO measurement campaigns in an anechoic and an indoor environment where the measured capacities are compared with the capacities obtained from our models. All experimental results validate our predictions and, hence, confirm the potential for superior MIMO performance (when the developed criterion is applied) in strong LoS channels.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","startPage":"2194","endPage":"2202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Performance Assessment of High-Capacity MIMO Architectures in the Presence of a Line-of-Sight Component","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance Assessment of High-Capacity MIMO Architectures in the Presence of a Line-of-Sight Component","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616420","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4277091/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance Assessment of High-Capacity MIMO Architectures in the Presence of a Line-of-Sight Component","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-sarris-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076264S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4277092,"authors":[{"name":"Oh-Soon Shin","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea","Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277092/4277092-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oh-Soon Shin received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998, 2000, and 2004, respectively.","From 2004 to 2005, he was with the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

In order to implement RAKE reception, the delays, phases, and magnitudes of the different paths need to be estimated and the estimates updated. In the context of burst transmissions, delays do not vary during a burst, and only phases and magnitudes need to be tracked. In this paper, we investigate the issue of phase tracking over rapidly time-varying multipath channels. We propose a new version of the conventional phase loop that mitigates the interpath interference effect. The optimization is based on the concept of prefiltering. The analysis shows improved tracking performance in comparison with the standard phase recovery algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277093.pdf","startPage":"2216","endPage":"2225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization Over Rapidly Time-Varying Multipath Channel for CDMA Downlink RAKE Receivers in Time-Division Mode","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multipath channels","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Fading","Delay estimation","Phase estimation","Interference","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency synchronization","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference (signal)","multipath channels","multiuser channels","radio receivers","synchronisation","time division multiple access","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization","time-varying multipath channel","CDMA downlink","RAKE receivers","time-division code-division multiple-access system","multiuser multipath channel","conventional phase loop","interpath interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple access (CDMA)","downlink","multipath channels","phase estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization Over Rapidly Time-Varying Multipath Channel for CDMA Downlink RAKE Receivers in Time-Division Mode","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4277093/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606009","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization Over Rapidly Time-Varying Multipath Channel for CDMA Downlink RAKE Receivers in Time-Division Mode","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-simon-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102203S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4277094,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277094/4277094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stephen Lam was born in Hong Kong on June 16, 1973.

Modeling the channel using the continuous-fading model, a matrix state-space model, which naturally represents the temporal and spatial dimensions of a MIMO system, is introduced. A consistent and novel matrix CE/DD scheme is developed using a matrix Kalman filter and a matrix normalized-innovations-based maximum-likelihood detector. In MIMO CE/DD in multiplicative fading, symmetric STBCs (S-STBCs) cause isometric data sequences, which lead to a detection error floor. Motivated by the minimization of the probability of error, two asymmetric STBCs are introduced to be used with these S-STBCs to mitigate isometry. To further improve detection performance, a self-matching STBC (SM-STBC), which mitigates isometry using asymmetry, improves estimation performance using training, and improves detection performance by adapting its code properties, is introduced. This SM-STBC generalizes a limited version that was previously proposed. A comprehensive analysis, which is supported by some simulation studies, indicates that the proposed framework of transceiver and STBC designs offers excellent detection performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277094.pdf","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Matching Space-Time Block Codes for Matrix Kalman Estimator-Based ML Detector in MIMO Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Kalman filters","Maximum likelihood estimation","Detectors","MIMO","Fading","Symmetric matrices","Maximum likelihood detection","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","fading channels","filtering theory","Kalman filters","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","radio networks","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-matching space-time block codes","matrix Kalman estimator","ML Detector","MIMO fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric space-time block code (STBC)","continuous-fading model (CFM)","innovations","matrix Kalman filtering","self-matching STBC (SM-STBC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Self-Matching Space-Time Block Codes for Matrix Kalman Estimator-Based ML Detector in MIMO Fading Channels","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4277094/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616421","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Matching Space-Time Block Codes for Matrix Kalman Estimator-Based ML Detector in MIMO Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-slam-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122464S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4277095,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A commonly adopted detection strategy is to use a chosen deterministic template to correlate the received signal segment by segment, and only those segments having significant cross correlation with the template are selected, temporally synchronized, and cophased in their projections for coherent combining. Correlating a deterministic template with a random signal usually results in only partial energy captured by the receiver since a random signal is of multidimensions. In this paper, we construct a receiver with multiple orthogonal branches to fully capture the signal energy, in much the same way as a quadrature receiver does in conventional digital communications. The local reference signals are derived from the orthogonal expansion of UWB signals. The random projections of a UWB signal onto different orthogonal basis functions are noncoherently combined, leading to the concept of dimension diversity. Dimension diversity can be either used alone or alongside a Rake receiver to further exploit path diversity. The error performance of proposed receivers is analyzed, and their superiority over the conventional ones is examined by numerical results based on real UWB data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimension-Diversity Receiver for the Detection of UWB Signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277095.pdf","startPage":"2226","endPage":"2234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Dimension-Diversity Receiver for the Detection of UWB Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4277095/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimension-Diversity Receiver for the Detection of UWB Signals","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-ssong-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070666S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4277096,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsuan Tang","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277096/4277096-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Hsuan Tang (S'01) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1997 and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Electronics, NCTU, in 2007.","Her research interests are in the area of wireless communications, multiuser detection, and iterative decoding."]},"firstName":"Chih-Hsuan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37337365700"},{"name":"Che-Ho Wei","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4277057/4277096/4277096-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Che-Ho Wei (S'73\u2013M'76\u2013SM'87\u2013F'96) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1968 and 1978, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1976.","From 1976 to 1979, he was an Associate Professor at National Chiao Tung University.

In this paper, a single-bounce two-ring statistical model for the time-varying MIMO flat fading channels is proposed. In the model, both the base and mobile stations are surrounded by their own ring of scatterers. For the proposed model, a closed-form expression for the spatio-temporal cross-correlational function between any two subchannels is derived, assuming single-bounce scattering. The new analytical expression includes several key physical parameters of interest such as the mean angle-of-departure, the mean angle-of-arrival, the associated angle spreads, and the Doppler spread in a compact form. The model includes many existing correlation models as special cases. Its utility is demonstrated by a comparison with collected MIMO data in terms of the spatio-temporal correlations, level crossing rate, average fade duration, and the instantaneous mutual information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Varying MIMO Channels: Parametric Statistical Modeling and Experimental Results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.897643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4277057/04277097.pdf","startPage":"1949","endPage":"1963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.897643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Time-Varying MIMO Channels: Parametric Statistical Modeling and Experimental Results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4277097/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9619900","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Varying MIMO Channels: Parametric Statistical Modeling and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"56tvt04-wang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175587S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4277057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4277057","articleId":"4277097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4277100,"authors":[{"name":"Rainfield Y.

In this method, multiple, limited- diffraction array beams or steered plane wave transmissions are used to increase image resolution and field of view as well as to reduce sidelobes. Furthermore, the multiple, limited-diffraction array beam transmissions can be approximated with square-wave aperture weightings, allowing one or two transmitters to be used with a multielement array transducer to simplify imaging systems. By varying the number of transmissions, the extended HFR imaging method allows a continuous trade-off between image quality and frame rate. Because multiple transmissions are needed to obtain one frame of image for the method, motion could cause phase misalignment and thus produce artifacts, reducing image contrast and resolution and leading to an inaccurate clinical interpretation of images. Therefore, it is important to study how motion affects the method and provide a useful guidance of using the method properly in various applications. In this paper, computer simulations, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to study the effects of motion on the method in different conditions. Results show that a number of factors may affect the motion effects. However, it was found that the extended HFR imaging method is not sensitive to the motions commonly encountered in the clinical applications, as is demonstrated by an in vivo heart experiment, unless the number of transmissions is large and objects are moving at a high velocity near the surface of a transducer.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2007.391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4277137/04277147.pdf","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2007.391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Artifacts of Extended High Frame Rate Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277147/","displayDocTitle":"Motion Artifacts of Extended High Frame Rate Imaging","volume":"54","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621381","pubMedId":"17718320","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4277147/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Artifacts of Extended High Frame Rate Imaging","sourcePdf":"t0771303.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089425S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4277137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4277137","articleId":"4277147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4277155,"authors":[{"name":"Yook-kong Yong","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4277137/4277155/4277155-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yook-Kong Yong (M'86) is a professor at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.

The acoustical characteristics of the plate resonator are changed when the plate is mounted onto a base substrate. The base substrate affects the frequency spectra of the plate resonator. A resonator with a high Q may not have a similarly high Q when mounted on a base. Hence, the base is an energy sink and the Q will be affected by the shape and size of this base. A lower bound Q will be obtained if the base is a semi-infinite base since it will absorb all acoustical energies radiated from the resonator. A scaled boundary finite element method is employed to model a semi-infinite base. The frequency spectra of the quartz resonator with and without the base are presented. In addition to the loss of energy via the base, there are other factors which affect the resonator Q, such as, for example, material dissipation, and damping at the interfaces of quartz and electrodes. The energy dissipation due to material damping increases with the resonant frequency and the reduction of resonator size; hence material damping becomes important in the current and future miniaturized resonators operating at very high frequencies. An energy sink model along with material dissipation would provide realistic Q, motional capacitance, motional resistance, and other figures of merit useful for designing resonators. The model could be used for evaluating resonator and mountings designs of microelectromechanical systems and miniaturized devices. The effect of the mountings, and plate and electrode geometries on the resonator Q and other electrical parameters are presented for AT-cut quartz resonators. Model results from the energy sink method were compared with experimental results and were found to be good.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2007.399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4277137/04277155.pdf","startPage":"1386","endPage":"1398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2007.399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Quartz Resonator Q and other Figures of Merit by an Energy Sink Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277155/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Quartz Resonator Q and other Figures of Merit by an Energy Sink Method","volume":"54","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621385","pubMedId":"17718328","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4277155/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Quartz Resonator Q and other Figures of Merit by an Energy Sink Method","sourcePdf":"t0771386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089687S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4277137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4277137","articleId":"4277155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4277156,"authors":[{"name":"Tadeusz Stepinski","affiliation":["Signals and Systems, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4277137/4277156/4277156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tadeusz Stepinski was born in December 1950 in Poland.

The spectrum is then interpolated to convert the polar coordinate system used for the acquisition of ultrasonic signals to the rectangular coordinates used for the presentation of imaging results. After compensating the transducer lobe amplitude profile using a Wiener filter, the transformed spectrum is subjected to the 2D inverse Fourier transform to get the time-domain image again. The algorithm is computationally attractive due to the use of 2D FFT. The performance of the proposed frequency-domain algorithm and the classical time-domain SAFT are compared in the paper using simulated and real ultrasonic data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277156/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","volume":"54","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9621386","pubMedId":"17718329","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4277156/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Implementation of Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique in Frequency Domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Implementation of Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique in Frequency Domain","sourcePdf":"t0771399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062029S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4277137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4277137","articleId":"4277156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":4277193,"authors":[{"name":"Guntram Scheible","affiliation":["Univ. of Karlshure, Karlsruhe"],"bio":{"p":["Guntram Scheible, member of VDI, holds a degree from the Universities of Karlsruhe and a Ph.D. from the University of Hagen (Germany), both in electrical engineering.

These sensors are robust and easy to use without compromising noise performance. They are optimized for operation with our high-speed direct-coupled flux-locked loop (FLL) electronics XXF-1. For the readout of cryogenic detectors, series arrays of 16 SQUIDs with 3 nH input inductance were designed which can be cooled down and operated in the Earth's field without magnetic shield. A compact gradiometric design allows the chips to be mounted directly on a Cu block at the cold stage of a mK cryostat without degradation in noise. A current noise level of 9 or 5 is achieved at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. Ultra-high-speed operation was demonstrated by using a cold FLL electronics prototype in close proximity to the SQUID array. An extremely high FLL bandwidth of 350 MHz was achieved which outperforms any flux-locked SQUID before by more than an order of magnitude. For applications requiring a larger input inductance of up to 2 , integrated two-stage sensors were developed consisting of a single front-end SQUID with double-transformer coupling read out by a 16-SQUID array. These sensors are very convenient to use as their voltage-flux characteristic is essentially single-SQUID-like. Devices optimized for 4.2 K operation have a coupled energy resolution around 50 times Planck's constant . Heavily shunted devices for low-temperature operation typically achieve 80 or 8 at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. An optional current limiter (Q-spoiler) at the input reduces the input current in pulsed applications like nuclear magnetic resonance or magnetorelaxometry. Integrated rf filters and resistor-capacitor shunts across the input coil result in smooth, well-behaved voltage-flux characteristics even at low temperatures 4.2 K. For magnetic field sensing applications, integrated miniature multiloop magnetometers were designed with maximized field resolution.

A multiple-flux-quantum generator, which produces quantum-accurate waveforms suitable for ADC applications, and an output data link were demonstrated. Both circuits were implemented using critically damped, dc-powered SQUIDs stacked in series. In the past, the voltage output achievable with this approach has been severely limited by parasitic capacitance to ground and to the control lines. Parasitic capacitance inhibits SQUID operation both at turn-on and turn-off. Using inductive isolation between SQUIDs, parasitic capacitance was completely tuned out. A 100-flux-quantum waveform generator, based on a series stack of 100 SQUIDs, operated at 6 Gb/s, fabricated in a 4.5 kA-per-square-cm Josephson junction process. The output amplifier produced a 1 mV swing at 12 Gb/s non-return-to-zero. This circuit is based on a stack of only two SQUIDs, and uses both inductive isolation and asymmetric resistive shunting to enhance the out-of-phase oscillation mode.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4277446/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9605980","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Inductive Isolation in Stacked SQUID Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductive Isolation in Stacked SQUID Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"17tasc02-herr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035631S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"4277256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4277256","articleId":"4277446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4277464,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Introzzi","affiliation":["INRIM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica), Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Introzzi","id":"37070855300"},{"name":"Mauro Rajteri","affiliation":["INRIM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica), Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Rajteri","id":"37314230500"},{"name":"Giorgio Brida","affiliation":["INRIM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica), Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Brida","id":"37299215000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"4277464","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryogenics","Superconducting photodetectors","MMICs","Temperature","Radio frequency","Preamplifiers","Wideband","Integrated circuit noise","Working environment noise","Superconducting device noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryogenic electronics","MMIC","network synthesis","radiofrequency amplifiers","superconducting photodetectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryogenic RF-preamplifier","superconducting photodetector readout circuits","radiofrequency broadband low-noise preamplifier","monolithic microwave integrated circuits","MMIC","GaAs","InP","HEMT","HBT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryogenic amplifier","monolithic-microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)","noise measurements","superconducting single photon detector (SSPD)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277464","abstract":"This work addresses the problem of designing superconducting photodetector readout circuits.

However, conventional electric motors do not achieve a power density high enough to be considered in airborne applications. Bulk high temperature superconducting (HTS) materials, such as YBCO pellets, have the capacity of trapping magnetic flux thus behaving as permanent magnets. Experimental data show that one single domain YBCO pellets could trap up to 17 T at 29 K, which enables the design of very high power density motors that could be used in aircraft propulsion. We designed a superconducting motor based on an axial flux configuration and composed of six YBCO plates magnetized by a superconducting coil wound on the outside of the motor. The six-pole homopolar machine uses a conventional air-gap resistive armature. Axial-flux configuration allows several rotors and stators to be stacked together and therefore enables the use of one or several conventional permanent magnet rotors to generate minimum safety torque in case of loss of superconductivity. All-electric aircraft are expected to be powered by fuel cells or turbo-generators fed with pure hydrogen cryogenically stored that would provide the motor with a convenient cooling system at 20 K. This paper presents the design and simulated performance of the motor for an application in aircraft propulsion.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2007.898120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277259","startPage":"1533","endPage":"1536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/4277259/04277591.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of HTS Axial Flux Motor for Aircraft Propulsion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4277591/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of HTS Axial Flux Motor for Aircraft Propulsion","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9647428","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of HTS Axial Flux Motor for Aircraft Propulsion","sourcePdf":"17tasc02-masson4-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033131S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"4277259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4277259","articleId":"4277591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4277631,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Nobumori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Nobumori","id":"37938290000"},{"name":"Takanobu Nishigai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takanobu","lastName":"Nishigai","id":"37427838200"},{"name":"Kazunori Nakamiya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Nakamiya","id":"37938291900"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Yoshikawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuyuki","lastName":"Yoshikawa","id":"37275775800"},{"name":"Akira Fujimaki","affiliation":["Department of Quantum Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Fujimaki","id":"37282899900"},{"name":"Hirotaka Terai","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Terai","id":"37270771200"},{"name":"Shinich Yorozu","affiliation":["Superconductivity Research Laboratory, International Superconductivity Technology Center, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinich","lastName":"Yorozu","id":"37282901300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"4277631","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"abstract":"A microprocessor test vehicle was developed for the investigation of asynchronous design methodology for rapid- single-flux-quantum (RSFQ) circuits.

The performance of the handshaking system was enhanced based on the scalable-delay-insensitive (SDI) model. The SCRAM2 is an 8-bit bit-serial microprocessor with three-stage pipelining, with a basic microarchitecture similar to that of our previously designed synchronous microprocessor, CORE1alpha.

Our calculations suggest that heating which occurs after the formation of a photo-induced resistive barrier is responsible for the generation of a measurable voltage pulse. We compared this numerical result with experimental data of a voltage pulse from a slow device, i.e. large kinetic inductance, and obtained a good fit. Using this electro-thermal model, we estimated the temperature rise and the resistance buildup in the nanowire, and the return current at which the nanowire becomes superconducting again. We also show that the reset time of these photodetectors can be decreased by the addition of a series resistance and provide supporting experimental data. Finally we present preliminary results on a detector latching behavior that can also be explained using the electro-thermal model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277823/","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4277823/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9613100","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the Electrical and Thermal Response of Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the Electrical and Thermal Response of Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors","sourcePdf":"17tasc02-yang-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05165S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"4277256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"4277256","articleId":"4277823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4277830,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Yohannes","affiliation":["Hypres, Inc., Elmsford, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Yohannes","id":"37314426400"},{"name":"Alex Kirichenko","affiliation":["Hypres, Inc., Elmsford, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Kirichenko","id":"37386956100"},{"name":"Saad Sarwana","affiliation":["Hypres, Inc., Elmsford, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Saad","lastName":"Sarwana","id":"37313710100"},{"name":"Sergey K.

Dynamically-biased shunt feedback is proposed in the buffer to lower its output resistance such that the pole at the gate of the pass device is pushed to high frequencies without dissipating large quiescent current. By employing the current-buffer compensation, only a single pole is realized within the regulation loop unity-gain bandwidth and over 65deg phase margin is achieved under the full range of the load current in the LDO. The LDO thus achieves stability without using any low-frequency zero. The maximum output-voltage variation can be minimized during load transients even if a small output capacitor is used. The LDO with the proposed impedance-attenuated buffer has been implemented in a 0.35-mum twin-well CMOS process. The proposed LDO dissipates 20-muA quiescent current at no-load condition and is able to deliver up to 200-mA load current. With a 1-muF output capacitor, the maximum transient output-voltage variation is within 3% of the output voltage with load step changes of 200 mA/100 ns.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.900281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4277855/04277856.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.900281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Transient-Enhanced Low-Quiescent Current Low-Dropout Regulator With Buffer Impedance Attenuation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Transient-Enhanced Low-Quiescent Current Low-Dropout Regulator With Buffer Impedance Attenuation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277856/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9613084","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4277856/","volume":"42","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Transient-Enhanced Low-Quiescent Current Low-Dropout Regulator With Buffer Impedance Attenuation","sourcePdf":"42jssc08-alshyoukh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061283S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4277855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"249","xplore-issue":"4277855","articleId":"4277856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4277857,"authors":[{"name":"Changhua Cao","affiliation":["Silicon Laboratories Inc., Austin, TX, USA","Silicon Microwave Integrated Circuits and System Research Group, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4277855/4277857/4277857-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changhua Cao (S'04) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.","Currently, he is a Design Engineer with Silicon Labs Inc., Austin, TX.

High linearity, even at a low supply voltage, is achieved through the use of duty-cycle-controlled tuning. Tuning MOSFETs are switched completely on while conducting, such that their nonlinear resistance is much smaller than the linear filter resistors, resulting in low distortion. The MOSFETs are also placed inside the filter feedback loop which further reduces distortion. Because tuning is done in the time domain, rather than in the voltage domain, the tuning range is independent of the supply voltage. The filter achieves -77 dB total harmonic distortion (THD) using a 0.6-V supply, and -90 dB THD using a 0.8-V supply, with a 0.6-Vpp differential 2 kHz sine input.

The T-network TIA provides on-chip transimpedance gains of up to 25 MOmega, has a measured capacitive resolution of 0.02 aF/radicHz at 15 kHz, a wide dynamic range of 104 dB in a bandwidth of 10 Hz and consumes 400 muW of power.

A circuit technique is introduced to dynamically set the common-mode (CM) voltage of the differential varactor control signals equal to the VCO's CM. Compared to other commonly used techniques such as replica biasing, this technique does not dissipate any extra power and it accurately tracks the output common-mode voltage of the VCO during the oscillations. Using a differential control a very wide tuning range from 4.5 GHz to 7.1 GHz (45%) is achieved.

Then, we explain a practical way of measuring the mutual flux in SR motors and present the test results for an 8/6 pole, four-phase 4 kW motor. We simulated the performance of the SR motor with and without mutual flux, thereby demonstrating the effect of mutual flux on phase current, flux, and average torque. We verified the effect of mutual flux on position estimation by simulation and experiment. We show that appropriate correction for mutual flux may improve the accuracy of estimated position by 3deg, which will give better performance of the drive while driven without any shaft sensors. We also show that an SR motor with an odd number of phases is a better choice than one with an even number of phases because of its symmetric mutual coupling, its ability to utilize short flux paths, and the fact that it does not require costly bipolar excitation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4277883/04277909.pdf","startPage":"3445","endPage":"3456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.898101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.898101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277883","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Coupling and Its Effect on Steady-State Performance and Position Estimation of Even and Odd Number Phase Switched Reluctance Motor Drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual coupling","Steady-state","Phase estimation","Reluctance motors","Strontium","Finite element methods","Magnetic sensors","Sensorless control","Circuit testing","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductance","magnetic flux","reluctance motor drives","shafts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched reluctance motor drive","asymmetric mutual flux","symmetric mutual coupling","shaft sensors","short flux paths","bipolar excitation","steady-state performance","position estimation","mutual inductance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mutual flux","mutual flux measurement","position estimation","SR motor","steady-state performance","symmetric and asymmetric mutual coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Coupling and Its Effect on Steady-State Performance and Position Estimation of Even and Odd Number Phase Switched Reluctance Motor Drive","volume":"43","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4277909/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606788","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Coupling and Its Effect on Steady-State Performance and Position Estimation of Even and Odd Number Phase Switched Reluctance Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"43tmag08-panda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087403S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4277883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4277883","articleId":"4277909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4277911,"authors":[{"name":"Waseem Roshen","affiliation":["SSPower Technology, IBM, Corporation, Hilliard, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Waseem","lastName":"Roshen","id":"37270216300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4277911","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2460},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous motors","Induction machines","Finite element methods","Synchronous machines","AC motors","Magnetic losses","Hysteresis","Magnetic analysis","Iron alloys","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iron loss model","permanent-magnet synchronous motors","induction machines","correction factors","eddy-current loss component","finite-element method","AC machines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC machines","AC motors","eddy-current losses","iron","iron alloys","losses","magnetic losses"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4277883/04277911.pdf","startPage":"3428","endPage":"3434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.899687","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.899687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iron Loss Model for Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","abstract":"Iron losses in permanent-magnet synchronous machines form a larger portion of the total losses than in induction machines and, hence, more importance should be given to the iron losses. Previously, models have been presented for the calculations of these losses, but these models still rely on finite-element simulations to obtain correction factors, which are substantial, to apply to the theoretically derived formulas in order to obtain good agreement with the experimental data. This paper points out the source of this correction factor: the neglect of the excess eddy-current loss component. In many cases, this loss component dominates the total iron losses and needs to be incorporated in the theoretical considerations. The paper also provides a more complete model of iron loss, which greatly reduces the need for calculating the correction factors using the finite-element method (FEM). This more complete model reduces design time, especially when a number of candidate designs need to be analyzed. Otherwise, the calculation of the correction factors using FEM would be cumbersome, as the correction factors tend to be nonlinear.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","volume":"43","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9607690","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4277911/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Iron Loss Model for Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iron Loss Model for Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","sourcePdf":"43tmag08-roshen2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043363S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","isNumber":"4277883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"44","articleId":"4277911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4277919,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China","Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Haibin Zhang (M'05) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D degrees in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1992, 1995, and 2002, respectively.","He joined the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in 1996, where he became an Associate Professor in 2002.

Impulsive control laws are investigated which make use of linear static measurement feedback, instead of full state feedback. A less conservative sufficient condition than existing results for global asymptotic impulsive synchronization is presented, in which synchronization is proven for the error between the full state vectors. And then an linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approach for designing linear static output feedback impulsive control laws to globally asymptotically synchronize Lur'e chaotic systems is derived. With the help of the LMI solvers, we can easily obtain the linear output feedback impulsive controller and the bound of the impulsive interval for global asymptotic synchronization. The method is illustrated on Chua's circuit.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.898468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4277920/04277930.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"714","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.898468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulsive Synchronization of Chaotic Lur'e Systems by Linear Static Measurement Feedback: An LMI Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Impulsive Synchronization of Chaotic Lur'e Systems by Linear Static Measurement Feedback: An LMI Approach","volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4277930/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607744","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulsive Synchronization of Chaotic Lur'e Systems by Linear Static Measurement Feedback: An LMI Approach","sourcePdf":"54tcsii08-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055417S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4277920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4277920","articleId":"4277930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4277933,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Nielsen","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"37287833600"},{"name":"Torben Larsen","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Torben","lastName":"Larsen","id":"37271924000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4277933","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":949},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Delta modulation","Switches","Radio frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Phase modulation","Power amplifiers","RF signals","High power amplifiers","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase modulation","power amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain signals","phase modulated clock","filtering","RF switch","switch-mode power amplification","delta-sigma modulation","transmitter architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delta\u2013sigma","power amplifier (PA)","RF","switch mode","transmitter architecture","varying envelope"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277933","abstract":"This brief presents a method of deploying RF switch-mode power amplification for varying envelope signals. Thereby the power amplifier can be operated as a switch with a high power efficiency as the result. The key idea is to transmit either a full RF period or none at all in such a way that the correct modulated RF signal is obtained after filtering. This is accomplished in a novel configuration of a low-pass DeltaSigma modulator using a phase modulated clock combined with a simple AND-gate. The designed modulator is easy to implement, displays very good linearity and offers time domain signals that promote the power efficiency of the power amplifier. The working principle is described through theory and simulations, and validation is done via measurements on a prototype of the modulator. Measurements on the prototype show that the presented modulator modulates a UMTS signal with more than 10-dB margin to the spectrum mask and EVM below 0.85% RMS (req<17.5%).

Long and thick bulk-micromachined resonating block structures, which are referred to as ldquosilicon bulk acoustic wave resonatorrdquo (SiBAR), are fabricated using the high-aspect-ratio poly and single crystalline siliconrdquo (HARPSS) fabrication process on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. Such resonators operate in their horizontal width extensional modes with quality factors in the range of 10000-100000. With their comparatively large electrode area and deep-submicrometer capacitive transduction gaps, such resonators have demonstrated comparatively low impedances for capacitive resonators that are well within the desired range for high-frequency electronic applications. Sub-kilo-Ohm total electrical resistances and extracted motional resistance as low as 200 are demonstrated for the fundamental width extensional modes of SiBARs in the very-high-frequency range. Resonant frequencies up to 1.55 GHz are demonstrated for the higher resonance modes of the capacitive SiBARs with comparatively low impedances. Part I of this paper presents the basic operation concepts and fabrication methodology for the HARPSS-on-SOI SiBARs. Extensive resonator measurement data, including temperature characteristics, are presented in Part II of this paper, and different frequency tuning approaches for temperature compensation of such resonators are discussed and investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4277948/04277975.pdf","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2007.901403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2007.901403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4277948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4277975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Impedance VHF and UHF Capacitive Silicon Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators\u2014Part I: Concept and Fabrication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Silicon","Shape","Film bulk acoustic resonators","Fabrication","Acoustic waves","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic resonators","bulk acoustic wave devices","micromachining","micromechanical resonators","silicon","silicon-on-insulator","UHF devices","VHF devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bulk-micromachined resonating block structures","silicon-on-insulator substrates","deep-submicrometer capacitive transduction gaps","sub-kilo-ohm total electrical resistances","extracted motional resistance","resonant frequencies","frequency tuning","temperature compensation","MEMS","micromachining","micromechanical resonators","high-aspect-ratio poly and single crystalline silicon","HARPSS-on-SOI SiBAR","silicon-on-insulator substrates","capacitive resonators","single-crystal silicon","capacitive silicon bulk acoustic wave resonator","UHF","VHF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bulk acoustic wave resonators","high-aspect-ratio poly and single crystalline silicon (HARPSS)","MEMS","micromachining","micromechanical resonators","silicon resonators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4277975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low-Impedance VHF and UHF Capacitive Silicon Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators\u2014Part I: Concept and Fabrication","volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4277975/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9619907","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Impedance VHF and UHF Capacitive Silicon Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators\u2014Part I: Concept and Fabrication","sourcePdf":"54ted08-pourkamali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049686S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4277948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4277948","articleId":"4277975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4277978,"authors":[{"name":"Wataru Saito","affiliation":["The Discrete Semiconductor Development Department, Toshiba Corporation, Semiconductor Company, Kawasaki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4277948/4277978/4277978-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wataru Saito (M'04) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1994, 1996, and 1999, respectively.","Since 1999, he has been with Discrete Semiconductor Division, Semiconductor Company, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan, where he has been engaged in the development of power semiconductor devices.

Several frequency estimation techniques have been developed and are used to help the induction machine fault detection and diagnosis. This paper presents a technique to improve the fault detection technique by using the classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. This method is a powerful tool that extracts meaningful frequencies from the signal, and it has been widely used in different areas, which include electrical machines. In the proposed application, the fault sensitive frequencies have to be found in the stator current signature. They are numerous in a given frequency range, and they are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the MUSIC method takes a long computation time to find many frequencies by increasing the dimension of the autocorrelation matrix. To solve this problem, an algorithm that is based on zooming in a specific frequency range is proposed with MUSIC in order to improve the performances of frequency extraction. Moreover, the method is integrated as a part of MUSIC to estimate the frequency signal dimension order based on classification of autocorrelation matrix eigenvalues. The proposed algorithm has been applied to detect a rotor broken bar fault in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine under different loads and in steady-state condition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Resolution Frequency Estimation Method for Three-Phase Induction Machine Fault Detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.899826","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4265775/04278024.pdf","startPage":"2305","endPage":"2314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.899826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4265775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A High-Resolution Frequency Estimation Method for Three-Phase Induction Machine Fault Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4278024/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9616473","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Resolution Frequency Estimation Method for Three-Phase Induction Machine Fault Detection","sourcePdf":"54tie04-kia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090894S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4265775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"4265775","articleId":"4278024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4278026,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Cunha Oliveira","affiliation":["Departmento de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Alexandre Cunha Oliveira was born in Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, Brazil, in 1970.

This strategy overcomes one of the main problems of this converter, which is the low-frequency voltage oscillation that appears in the neutral point under some operating conditions. The proposed modulation strategy can completely remove this oscillation for all the operating points and for any kind of loads, even unbalanced and nonlinear loads. The algorithm is based on a carrier-based pulsewidth modulation. Nevertheless, it can generate the maximum output-voltage amplitudes that are attainable under linear modulation, such as space-vector modulation. Furthermore, this technique can be implemented with a very simple algorithm and, hence, can be processed very quickly. The only drawback of this strategy is that the switching frequencies of the devices are one third higher than those of standard sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation. A control loop for balancing the voltages on the dc-link capacitors is also proposed. This balancing strategy is designed, so that it does not further increase the switching frequencies of the devices when it is applied to the converter. The proposed modulation technique is verified by simulation and experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

In this paper, the current distribution and AC loss of HTS coated conductor with ferromagnetic substrate are analysed using the finite element method taking account of the nonlinear E-J characteristics. Calculated results show that the AC transport current loss is increased because the current distribution changes in the superconducting layer due to the concentration of magnetic flux in the substrate.

In this paper, we propose the unified cellular and ad hoc network (UCAN) architecture for enhancing cell throughput while maintaining fairness. In UCAN, a mobile client has both 3G interface and IEEE 802.11 -based peer-to-peer links. The 3G base station forwards packets for destination clients with poor channel quality to proxy clients with better channel quality. The proxy clients then use an ad hoc network composed of other mobile clients and IEEE 802.11 wireless links to forward the packets to the appropriate destinations, thereby improving cell throughput. We refine the 3G base station scheduling algorithm so that the throughput gains are distributed in proportion to users' average channel rates, thereby maintaining fairness. With the UCAN architecture in place, we propose novel greedy and on-demand protocols for proxy discovery and ad hoc routing that explicitly leverage the existence of the 3G infrastructure to reduce complexity and improve reliability. We further propose secure crediting mechanisms to motivate users that are not actively receiving to participate in relaying packets for others. Through both analysis and extensive simulations with HDR and IEEE 802.11b, we show that the UCAN architecture can increase individual user's throughput by more than 100 percent and the aggregate throughput of the HDR downlink by up to 50 percent.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4278392/04278399.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.1035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.1035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Design and Evaluation of Unified Cellular and Ad-Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular networks","Ad hoc networks","Throughput","Aggregates","Base stations","Costs","Peer to peer computing","Scheduling algorithm","Maintenance","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","ad hoc networks","cellular radio","peer-to-peer computing","protocols","telecommunication network routing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified cellular network","ad hoc network","3G wireless data networks","mobile client","3G interface","IEEE 802.11-based peer-to-peer links","3G base station","destination clients","proxy clients","IEEE 802.11 wireless links","greedy protocols","on-demand protocols","ad hoc routing","IEEE 802.11b"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless","Algorithm/protocol design and analysis","Mobile communication systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Design and Evaluation of Unified Cellular and Ad-Hoc Networks","volume":"6","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4278399/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9686003","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Design and Evaluation of Unified Cellular and Ad-Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"h1060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074952S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4278392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4278392","articleId":"4278399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278408,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Meshkati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4278404/4278408/4278408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farhad Meshkati (S'98, M'06) received the B.A.Sc.

A non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay constraint. This strategy is different from one that would maximize spectral efficiency. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay, throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. In addition, the effect of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4278404/04278408.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278404","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy-Efficient Modulation in CDMA Networks with Delay QoS Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Throughput","Quality of service","Nash equilibrium","Game theory","Wireless networks","Delay effects","Wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","delays","game theory","quality of service","radio access networks","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game-theoretic approach","energy-efficient modulation","CDMA networks","wireless networks","M-QAM modulation","constellation size","spectral efficiency","delay QoS constraints","quality-of-service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy-Efficient Modulation in CDMA Networks with Delay QoS Constraints","volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4278408/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2007","accessionNumber":"9612590","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy-Efficient Modulation in CDMA Networks with Delay QoS Constraints","sourcePdf":"js_0706_1069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063101S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4278404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4278404","articleId":"4278408","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4278409,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Boise State University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4278404/4278409/4278409-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhu Han (S'01-M'04) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, in 1997, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.

Each individual user's goal is to minimize his/her own transmitted power in a distributed manner under the constraints that the desirable rate is achieved and the transmitted power is bounded. The pure non-cooperative game may result in non-convergence or some undesirable Nash Equilibriums with low system and individual performances. To enhance the performances, a virtual referee is introduced to the networks and is in charge of monitoring and improving the outcome of non-cooperative competition for resources among the distributed users. If the game outcome is not desirable, either the required transmission rates should be reduced or some users should be prevented from using some radio resources such as sub-channels, so that the rest of users can share the limited resources more efficiently. Moreover, it can be shown that the introduction of the virtual referee does not increase the complexity of the networks. From the simulation results in a two-cell case, the proposed scheme reduces the transmitted power by 80% and 25% compared with the fixed channel assignment algorithm and the iterative water-filling algorithm in the literature, respectively. The achievable rate can be improved by 10%. In a multi-cell case, the proposed scheme can have up to 40% power reduction compared with the iterative water-filling algorithm when the co-channel interferences are severe.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278409/","volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4278409/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9687081","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Non-cooperative resource competition game by virtual referee in multi-cell OFDMA networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-cooperative resource competition game by virtual referee in multi-cell OFDMA networks","sourcePdf":"js_0706_1079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123369S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4278404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"4278404","articleId":"4278409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278410,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth W.

Therefore, fully cooperative behaviors, such as cooperation for increasing system capacity, mitigating interference for each other, or honestly revealing private information, might not be directly applied. It has been shown that power control is an efficient approach to achieve quality of service (QoS) requirement in ad hoc networks. However, the existing work has largely relied on cooperation among different nodes/links or a pricing mechanism that often needs a third-party involvement. In this paper, we aim to design a non-cooperative power control algorithm without pricing mechanism for ad hoc networks. We view the interaction among the users' decision for power level as a repeated game. With the theory of stochastic fictitious play (SFP), we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to schedule each user's power level. There are three distinctive features in our proposed scheme. First, the user's decision at each stage is self-incentive with myopic best response correspondence. Second, the dynamics arising from our proposed algorithm eventually converges to pure Nash equilibrium (NE). Third, our scheme does not need any information exchange or to observe the opponents' private information. Therefore, this proposed algorithm can safely run in a fully selfish environment without any additional pricing and secure mechanism. Simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4278404/04278411.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278404","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-cooperative power control for wireless ad hoc networks with repeated games","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Mobile ad hoc networks","Pricing","Quality of service","Ad hoc networks","Centralized control","Interference","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic processes","Learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","game theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","power control","quality of service","telecommunication control","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncooperative power control","wireless ad hoc networks","repeated games","central controller","fully cooperative behaviors","system capacity","private information","quality of service","pricing mechanism","power level","stochastic fictitious play","reinforcement learning algorithm","myopic best response correspondence","Nash equilibrium","information exchange","fully selfish environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Non-cooperative power control for wireless ad hoc networks with repeated games","volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4278411/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2007","accessionNumber":"9621307","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-cooperative power control for wireless ad hoc networks with repeated games","sourcePdf":"js_0706_1101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095808S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4278404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4278404","articleId":"4278411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278416,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Feldman","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4278404/4278416/4278416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michal Feldman is a postdoc fellow at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at Tel-Aviv University.

Therefore, in the absence of incentives to the contrary, rational (i.e., selfish) intermediaries may choose to forward messages at a low priority or simply not forward messages at all. Using a principal-agent model, we show how the hidden-action problem can be overcome through appropriate design of contracts in both the direct (the endpoints contract with each individual router directly) and the recursive (each router contracts with the next downstream router) cases. We further show that, depending on the network topology, per-hop or per-path monitoring may not necessarily improve the utility of the principal or the social welfare of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","volume":"25","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"9614138","publicationDate":"August 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4278416/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hidden-Action in Network Routing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden-Action in Network Routing","sourcePdf":"js_0706_1161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131067S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4278404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4278404","articleId":"4278416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278420,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Shakkottai","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4278404/4278420/4278420-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Srinivas Shakkottai received the Bachelor of Engineering degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Bangalore University, India, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2003.

This paper extends the framework to nonlinear pricing and investigates optimal nonlinear pricing policy design for a monopolistic service provider. The problem is formulated as an incentive-design problem, and incentive (pricing) policies are obtained for a many-users regime, which enable the service provider to approach arbitrarily close to Pareto- optimal solutions. Under the assumption that the service provider knows the true user types, analytical and numerical results indicate a profit improvement exceeding 38% over linear pricing by the introduction of nonlinear pricing. We also consider the scenario where the service provider has incomplete information on user types. A comparative study of the results for complete information and incomplete information is carried out as well, with numerical results pointing to 25%-40% loss of profit by the service provider due to incompleteness of information on the user types.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Communication networks","Communication system control","Costs","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive schemes","Pareto optimisation","pricing","telecommunication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto-optimal solutions","price discrimination","incentive-design problem","network usage","communication network pricing","network service provider","optimal nonlinear pricing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4278404/04278421.pdf","startPage":"1216","endPage":"1223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Nonlinear Pricing for a Monopolistic Network Service Provider with Complete and Incomplete Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Nonlinear Pricing for a Monopolistic Network Service Provider with Complete and Incomplete Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278421/","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"August 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4278421/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9621311","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Nonlinear Pricing for a Monopolistic Network Service Provider with Complete and Incomplete Information","sourcePdf":"js_0706_1216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129887S","chronDate":"August  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4278404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4278404","articleId":"4278421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4278500,"authors":[{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineerin, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37084986500"},{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineerin, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37411446600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-370-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4278500","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278500","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Microfluidics","Medical diagnosis","DNA","Drugs","Design automation","Automatic control","Biomedical electrodes","Pins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","high level synthesis","lab-on-a-chip","logic partitioning","microfluidics","microprocessor chips","network routing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["droplet-trace-based array partitioning","pin assignment algorithm","automated digital microfluidic biochip design","point-of-care medical diagnostics","on-chip DNA analysis","automated drug discovery","synthesis tools","scheduling","droplet routing","Connect-5 algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["connect-5 algorithm","droplet trace","droplet-based microfluidics","pin-constrained biochip design","synthesis"]}],"doi":"10.1145/1176254.1176283","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4278477/4278478/04278500.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1176254.1176283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Droplet-trace-based array partitioning and a pin assignment algorithm for the automated design of digital microfluidic biochips","abstract":"Microfluidics-based biochips combine electronics with biology to open new application areas such as point-of-care medical diagnostics, on-chip DNA analysis, and automated drug discovery. Bioassays are mapped to microfluidic arrays using synthesis tools, and they are executed through the manipulation of sample and reagent droplets by electrical means. Most prior work on CAD for biochips has assumed independent control of electrodes using a large number of (electrical) input pins. Such solutions are not feasible for low-cost disposable biochips that are envisaged for many field applications. A more promising design strategy is to divide the microfluidic array into smaller partitions and use a small number of electrodes to control the electrodes in each partition. We propose a partitioning algorithm based on the concept of \"droplet trace\", which is extracted from the scheduling and droplet routing results produced by a synthesis tool. An efficient pin assignment method, referred to as the \"Connect-5 algorithm\", is combined with the array partitioning technique based on droplet traces.

A dominant part of the NoC area and power consumption is due to the buffers in the network interfaces (NIs) needed to decouple computation from communication. Having such a decoupling prevents stalling of IP blocks due to the communication interconnect. The size of these buffers is especially important in real-time systems, as there they should be big enough to obtain predictable performance. To ensure that buffers do not overflow, end- to-end flow-control is needed. One form of end-to-end flow- control used in NoCs is credit-based flow-control. This form places additional requirements on the buffer sizes, because the flow-control delays need to be taken into account. In this work, we present an algorithm to find the minimal decoupling buffer sizes for a NoC using TDMA and credit- based end-to-end flow-control, subject to the performance constraints of the applications running on the SoC. Our experiments show that our method results in a 84% reduction of the total NoC buffer area when compared to the state-of- the art buffer-sizing methods. Moreover, our method has a low run-time complexity, producing results in the order of minutes for our experiments, enabling quick design cycles for large SoC designs. Finally, our method can take into account multiple usecases running on the same SoC.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4278477/4278478/04278503.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","doi":"10.1145/1176254.1176287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1176254.1176287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278478","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A buffer-sizing algorithm for networks on chip using TDMA and credit-based end-to-end flow control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Time division multiple access","Communication system control","System-on-a-chip","Energy consumption","Silicon","Design optimization","Network interfaces","Computer interfaces","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","local area networks","logic design","low-power electronics","network interfaces","network-on-chip","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer-sizing algorithm","network-on-chip","TDMA","credit-based end-to-end flow control","power consumption","network interfaces","minimal decoupling buffer sizes","SoC design","Ethernet NoC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["area","buffers","networks-on-chip","systems-on-chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A buffer-sizing algorithm for networks on chip using TDMA and credit-based end-to-end flow control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4278503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9869645","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A buffer-sizing algorithm for networks on chip using TDMA and credit-based end-to-end flow control","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"28570130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07575S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4278477","isNumber":"4278478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278477","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4278478","articleId":"4278503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278510,"authors":[{"name":"Rainer Leupers","affiliation":["Dip.

The SHAPES routing fabric connects on-chip and off-chip tiles, weaving a distributed packet switching network. 3D next-neighbours engineering methodologies is adopted for off-chip networking and maximum system density. The SW challenge is to provide a simple and efficient programming environment for tiled architectures. SHAPES will investigate a layered system software, which does not destroy algorithmic and distribution info provided by the programmer and is fully aware of the HW paradigm. For efficiency and QoS, the system SW manages intra-tile and inter- tile latencies, bandwidths, computing resources, using static and dynamic profiling. The SW accesses the on-chip and off-chip networks through a homogeneous interface.","doi":"10.1145/1176254.1176297","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4278477/4278478/04278510.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1176254.1176297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278478","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SHAPES:: a tiled scalable software hardware architecture platform for embedded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SHAPES:: a tiled scalable software hardware architecture platform for embedded systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278510/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9869652","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4278510/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SHAPES:: a tiled scalable software hardware architecture platform for embedded systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"28570167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053904S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4278477","isNumber":"4278478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278477","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4278478","articleId":"4278510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278516,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Silvano","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Silvano","id":"37295776300"},{"name":"Donatella Sciuto","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Sciuto","id":"37273958200"},{"name":"Dario Bruschi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Bruschi","id":"37940617800"},{"name":"Giovanni Beltrame","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Beltrame","id":"37295768000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-370-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4278516","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space exploration","Computational modeling","Simulated annealing","Delay","Constraint optimization","Permission","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Testing","MPEG 4 Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","embedded systems","logic design","Markov processes","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision-theoretic exploration","multiprocessor platforms","design space exploration","power-performance approximate Pareto curve","domain knowledge","parameterized embedded SoC architectures","system-on-chip","Markov decision process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["basic block","micro-architecture simulation","program behavior"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an efficient technique to perform design space exploration of a multi-processor platform that minimizes the number of simulations needed to identify the power-performance approximate Pareto curve.

One of the major challenges in ASIP design is Design Space Exploration (DSE), because of the heterogeneity of the objectives and parameters involved. Typically DSE is a multi-objective search problem, where performance, power, area, etc. are the different optimization criteria. The output of a DSE strategy is a set of candidate design solutions called a Pareto-optimal set. Choosing a solution for system implementation from the Pareto-optimal set can be a difficult task, generally because Pareto-optimal sets can be extremely large or even contain an infinite number of solutions. In this paper we propose a methodology to assist the decision-maker in analysis of the solutions to multi-objective problems. By means of fuzzy clustering techniques, it finds the reduced Pareto subset, which best represents all the Pareto solutions. This optimal subset will be used for further and more accurate (but slower) analysis. As a real application example we address the optimization of area, performance, and power of a VLIW-based embedded system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278519/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9869661","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4278519/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy decision making in embedded system design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy decision making in embedded system design","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"28570223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4278477","isNumber":"4278478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278477","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4278478","articleId":"4278519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4278520,"authors":[{"name":"Yongseok Choi","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Yongseok","lastName":"Choi","id":"37066437000"},{"name":"Eui-Young Chung","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Korea"],"firstName":"Eui-Young","lastName":"Chung","id":"37286237800"},{"name":"Naehyuck Chang","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Korea"],"firstName":"Naehyuck","lastName":"Chang","id":"37278041200"},{"name":"Sung Woo Chung","affiliation":["Korea University, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Woo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37404238500"},{"name":"Chanik Park","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Korea"],"firstName":"Chanik","lastName":"Park","id":"37277788400"},{"name":"Yongsoo Joo","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Yongsoo","lastName":"Joo","id":"37331682000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-370-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4278520","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand paging for OneNAND<sup>TM</sup> Flash eXecute-in-place","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4278477/4278478/04278520.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS '06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1176254.1176310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278478","doi":"10.1145/1176254.1176310","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Embedded system","Read-write memory","Energy consumption","Memory management","Algorithm design and analysis","Permission","System-on-a-chip","Decoding","User interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","embedded systems","flash memories","mobile computing","NAND circuits","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OneNANDTM flash eXecute-ln-place","NAND flash memory","mobile embedded systems","code shadowing","NAND flash array","SRAM buffers","demand paging method","finite size sliding window"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND flash memory","OneNAND","XIP","demand paging","embedded systems","page replacement","virtual memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278520","abstract":"NAND flash memory can provide cost-effective secondary storage in mobile embedded systems, but its lack of a random access capability means that code shadowing is generally required, taking up extra RAM space. Demand paging with NAND flash memory has recently been proposed as an alternative which requires less RAM. This scheme is even more attractive for OneNAND flash, which consists of a NAND flash array with SRAM buffers, and supports eXecute-ln-Place (XIP), which allows limited random access to data on the SRAM buffers. We introduce a novel demand paging method for OneNAND flash memory with XIP feature. The proposed on-line demand paging method with XIP adopts finite size sliding window to capture the paging history and thus predict future page demands. We particularly focus on non-critical code accesses which can disturb real-time code. Experimental results show that our method outperforms conventional LRU-based demand paging by 57% in terms of execution time and by 63% in terms of energy consumption. It even beats the optimal solution obtained from MIN, which is a conventional off-line demand paging technique by 30% and 40% respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9869662","htmlLink":"/document/4278520/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Demand paging for OneNAND<sup>TM</sup> Flash eXecute-in-place","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand paging for OneNAND<sup>TM</sup> Flash eXecute-in-place","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"28570229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080181S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4278477","isNumber":"4278478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278477","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4278478","articleId":"4278520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278525,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Brodersen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Brodersen","id":"37280909600"},{"name":"Artem Tkachenko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Artem","lastName":"Tkachenko","id":"37294605700"},{"name":"Hayden Kwok-Hay So","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Hayden Kwok-Hay","lastName":"So","id":"37302177600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-59593-370-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4278525","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":288},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278525","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Runtime environment","Operating systems","Kernel","Application software","Software design","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer interfaces","Software standards","File systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","reconfigurable architectures","Unix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software runtime environment","FPGA-based reconfigurable computers","BORPH","hardware-software codesign","operating system","UNIX interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware process","reconfigurable computers"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hw/sw codesign methodology based on BORPH, an operating system designed for FPGA-based reconfigurable computers (RC's).

Most current approaches for web service discovery cater to semantic web services, i.e., web services that have semantic tagged descriptions. It is difficult, however, to expect all new services to have semantic descriptions associated. Furthermore, the descriptions of the vast majority of already existing services do not have explicitly associated semantics. There are also severe restrictions on the prospective conversion of existing, non-semantic, descriptions, e.g., Web service description language (WSDL), to corresponding semantic descriptions, e.g., OWL-based Web service ontology (OWL-S). In this paper we present a novel approach for web service discovery that combines ontology linking with latent semantic indexing (LSI). The basic idea is to build the service request vector according to the domain ontology, have the training set of the LSI classifier based on features extracted from selected WSDL files, and finally project the description vectors and the request vector and utilize the cosine measure to determine similarities and to retrieve relevant WSDL service descriptions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9869187","htmlLink":"/document/4278644/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Web Service Discovery: Adding Semantics through Service Request Expansion and Latent Semantic Indexing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Service Discovery: Adding Semantics through Service Request Expansion and Latent Semantic Indexing","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"29250106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096907S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4278609","isNumber":"4278610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278609","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4278610","articleId":"4278644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4278814,"authors":[{"name":"Yosuke Ozawa","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Yamato, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yosuke","lastName":"Ozawa","id":"37940964600"},{"name":"Teruo Koyanagi","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Yamato, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruo","lastName":"Koyanagi","id":"37823838700"},{"name":"Mari Abe","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Yamato, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Abe","id":"37823889600"},{"name":"Liangzhao Zeng","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The monitoring system needs to capture and to process numerous events while correlating them with other events stored in a database. If the database accesses become very frequent, read-only and write-only accesses can achieve high throughputs by applying well known solutions; a result cache and a batch update. However, the event processing of the monitoring includes both simultaneously. It is the case that is hard for the existing solutions to achieve high throughputs. Here, we introduce a new architecture, HM-hybrid, to process events for monitoring efficiently. It is a hybrid of a result cache and a batch update. And our model-driven approach makes it possible for them to work together in situations that are normally regarded as being unsuited for them. It processed 1207 events per second, about 43000 queries per second. It is 6 times better performance over a naive caching architecture in our experiments. The architecture seems useful for monitoring applications where there are many update and select queries.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4278814/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9869323","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Event-Processing Architecture based on the Model-driven Approach for High Performance Monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Event-Processing Architecture based on the Model-driven Approach for High Performance Monitoring","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"29260324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09196S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4278748","isNumber":"4278749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278748","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4278749","articleId":"4278814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4278815,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanzhe Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University Ministry of Education, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuanzhe","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539086700"},{"name":"Yi Hui","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hui","id":"37936233400"},{"name":"Wei Sun","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37292569600"},{"name":"Haiqi Liang","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haiqi","lastName":"Liang","id":"37827274500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2926-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4278815","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":128,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Service oriented architecture","Runtime","Information retrieval","Content based retrieval","Programming","Standards development","Standards publication","Software tools","Logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented programming","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service composition","Web 2.0","ad hoc composition technology","Web applications","mashup architecture","service-oriented architecture","mashup component model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4278815","abstract":"Mashup is a hallmark of Web 2.0 and attracts both industry and academia. It refers to an ad hoc composition technology of Web applications that allows users to draw upon content retrieved from external data sources to create entirely new services. Compared to traditional \"developer-centric\" composition technologies, e.g., BPEI and WSCI, mashup provides a flexible and easy-of-use way for service composition on Web. It makes the consumers free to compose services as they wish as well as simplifies the composition task. This paper makes two contributions. Firstly, we propose the mashup architecture, extend current SOA model with mashup and analyze how it facilitates service composition. Secondly, we propose a mashup component model to help developers leverage to create their own composite services. A case study is given to illustrate how to do service composition by mashup. This paper also discusses about some interesting topics about mashup.","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2007.67","pdfPath":"/iel5/4278748/4278749/04278815.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"339","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Services (Services 2007)","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Services (Services 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2007.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4278749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Service Composition Based on Mashup","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4278815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Towards Service Composition Based on Mashup","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9869324","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4278815/","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Service Composition Based on Mashup","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"29260332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057772S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4278748","isNumber":"4278749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4278748","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"4278749","articleId":"4278815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4278842,"authors":[{"name":"V.

To overcome the requirement for time interpolation at the boundary between the two grids, an unconditionally stable method, the alternating-direction-implicit (ADI-FDTD) method, has been used in the subgrid. As a result both the main FDTD grid and the subgrid use the same time-step.

The protocol has proved to work well under regular circumstances, but it was not designed to cope with malicious hosts. By performing ARP cache poisoning or ARP spoofing attacks, an intruder can impersonate another host (man-in-the-middle attack) and gain access to sensitive information. Several schemes to mitigate, detect and prevent these attacks have been proposed, but each has its limitations.

Although programmable shaders on these GPUs were designed for the creation of 3-D rendering effects, they can also be used as generic processing units for vector data. This paper proposes a hardware Tenderer capable of executing motion compensation, reconstruction, and visualization entirely on the GPU by the use of vertex and pixel shaders.

As an example, real-time playback of high-definition video (1080 p) was achieved at 62.0 frames per second, consuming only 68.2% of all CPU cycles on a modern machine.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Compensation and Reconstruction of H.264/AVC Video Bitstreams using the GPU","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services (WIAMIS '07)","doi":"10.1109/WIAMIS.2007.58","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services (WIAMIS '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4279098/4279099/04279177.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIAMIS.2007.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4279099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4279177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4279177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Motion Compensation and Reconstruction of H.264/AVC Video Bitstreams using the GPU","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4279177/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9863826","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Compensation and Reconstruction of H.264/AVC Video Bitstreams using the GPU","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"28180069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063446S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4279098","isNumber":"4279099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279098","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4279099","articleId":"4279177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4279191,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Ransburg","affiliation":["ITEC, Klagenfurt University, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ransburg","id":"37545503500"},{"name":"Christian Timmerer","affiliation":["ITEC, Klagenfurt University, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Timmerer","id":"37283891800"},{"name":"Hermann Hellwagner","affiliation":["ITEC, Klagenfurt University, Austria"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Hellwagner","id":"37267155100"},{"name":"Sylvain Devillers","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Devillers","id":"37294963300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2818-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4279191","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4279191","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codecs","Streaming media","Delay","Bandwidth","Scalability","Web server","Search engines","Telecommunications","Research and development","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","codecs","meta data","multimedia systems","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metadata-driven adaptation node","MPEG-21 digital item adaptation","media codec agnostic multimedia adaptation","static server-based adaptation","dynamic adaptation","content delivery"]}],"abstract":"MPEG-21 digital item adaptation (DIA) allows for a media codec agnostic multimedia adaptation approach which enables the implementation of generic adaptation engines.

We also propose a novel distributed MAC scheme to address these limitations, where active receivers determine whether a candidate transmitter should transmit its traffic or defer its transmission to a later time.

In this article we provide an overview of space-time (ST) coding, space-frequency (SF) coding, and space-time-frequency (STF) coding for MIMO-OFDM systems. Performance results show that STF coding can achieve the maximum diversity gain in an end- to-end MIMO-OFDM system over broadband wireless channels. Furthermore, for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), we propose a multiuser SF coding scheme that can achieve the maximum diversity for each user while minimizing the interference introduced from all the other users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4279214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621345","htmlLink":"/document/4279214/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Space-Time/Frequency Coding for MIMO-OFDM in Next Generation Broadband Wireless Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time/Frequency Coding for MIMO-OFDM in Next Generation Broadband Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"LETAIEF.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075579S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4279205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4279205","articleId":"4279214","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4279215,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Hu","affiliation":["Anhui University, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yanjun Hu (yanjunhu@ahu.edu.cn) is a full professor at the School of Electronic Science & Technology, Anhui University, and vice director of Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, China.

The architecture has several advantages compared to conventional CDMA systems. Specifically, it offers multiple-access-interference-free operation in AWGN channels, reduces co-channel interference significantly, and has the potential for higher capacity and spectral efficiency than conventional CDMA systems. This is accomplished by using an \"offset stacked\" spreading modulation technique followed by quadrature amplitude modulation, which optimizes performance in a fading environment. This new spreading modulation scheme also simplifies the rate matching algorithms relevant for multimedia services and IP-based applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4279205/04279218.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2007.386614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2007.386614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4279205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4279218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of next-generation cdma using orthogonal complementary codes and offset stacked spreading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Signal to noise ratio","Additive white noise","Spread spectrum communication","Gaussian noise","Degradation","AWGN","Noise generators","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","code division multiple access","complementarity","orthogonal codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP-based applications","multimedia services","rate matching algorithms","quadrature amplitude modulation","offset stacked spreading modulation","co-channel interference","AWGN channels","multiple-access-interference-free operation","time-frequency domain spreading","code-division multiple access system architecture","orthogonal complementary spreading codes","next-generation CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4279218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of next-generation cdma using orthogonal complementary codes and offset stacked spreading","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4279218/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621348","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of next-generation cdma using orthogonal complementary codes and offset stacked spreading","sourcePdf":"CHEN.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065492S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4279205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4279205","articleId":"4279218","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4279219,"authors":[{"name":"Iyappan Ramachandran","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Iyappan Ramachandran [S'04] (iyappan@ee.washington.edu) received a B.

Transactional support to integrated businesses via composing individual Web services is a critical issue. Current Web services protocols (e.g. BPEL4WS) have been proposed to deal with this issue on a strong assumption that each Web service is compensatable for a recovery purpose. It is arguable that Web services composition requires more transactional support beyond the compensation-based solution. This paper looks into the problem of transactional support for composing and scheduling those Web services that may have different transactional properties. The transactional properties of workflow constructs, which are fundamental to the composition of Web services, are thoroughly investigated. The concept of a connection point is introduced to derive the transactional properties of composite Web services. The scheduling issue of composite Web services is also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4279653/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9869074","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4279653/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deriving Transactional Properties of CompositeWeb Services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deriving Transactional Properties of CompositeWeb Services","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"29240631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078469S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4279552","isNumber":"4279553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279552","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4279553","articleId":"4279653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4279667,"authors":[{"name":"Valeria Cardellini","affiliation":["University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Cardellini","id":"37374004000"},{"name":"Emiliano Casalicchio","affiliation":["University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy"],"firstName":"Emiliano","lastName":"Casalicchio","id":"37272015700"},{"name":"Vincenzo Grassi","affiliation":["University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Grassi","id":"37399282500"},{"name":"Francesco Lo Presti","affiliation":["University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Lo Presti","id":"37283160400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2924-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4279667","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Web services","Linear programming","Concrete","Proposals","NP-hard problem","Heuristic algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Delay","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","linear programming","quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow-based service selection","Web service composition","multiple QoS classes","service oriented paradigm","quality of service","selection process","QoS requirements","linear programming problem","NP-hard problem"]}],"abstract":"In the service oriented paradigm applications are created as a composition of independently developed Web services. Since the same service may be offered by different providers with different non-functional Quality of Service (QoS) attributes, a selection process is needed to identify the constituent services for a given composite service that best meet the users QoS requirements. In this paper, we consider a broker that offers a composite service with multiple QoS classes to several users each generating a flow of requests over time. We propose a service selection scheme which optimizes the end-to-end aggregated QoS of all incoming flows of requests by means of a simple linear programming problem which scales as the number of users, request volumes and/or services grows. This approach differs from most of the current proposals which may not scale well since: a) requests, even from the same user, are handled independently from one another; and b) the selection process often requires the solution of an NP-hard problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2007.91","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4279552/4279553/04279667.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2007.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4279553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow-Based Service Selection forWeb Service Composition Supporting Multiple QoS Classes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4279667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4279667/","displayDocTitle":"Flow-Based Service Selection forWeb Service Composition Supporting Multiple QoS Classes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9869088","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4279667/","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow-Based Service Selection forWeb Service Composition Supporting Multiple QoS Classes","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"29240743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059087S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4279552","isNumber":"4279553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279552","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4279553","articleId":"4279667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4279849,"authors":[{"name":"Sarun Chaiworawitgul","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sarun","lastName":"Chaiworawitgul","id":"37937982200"},{"name":"Daricha Sutivong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Daricha","lastName":"Sutivong","id":"37297224200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0285-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0286-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3590"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3604"}],"articleNumber":"4279849","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Investments","Switches","Cost accounting","Uncertainty","Clocks","Logic design","Research and development","Technological innovation","Software design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software codesign","investment","object-oriented programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design decision","object-oriented design","code maintenance problem","aspect-oriented programming","Net Present Value","project investment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Object-oriented concept","aspect-oriented programming","hardware design","project investment under uncertainty","real options","technology switch"]}],"abstract":"Traditional hardware design is not flexible. Specification changes often require redesigning from scratch. The objected-oriented (OO) concept, which consists of encapsulation, inheritance and reusability mechanisms, is applied to solve the problem. However, the OO concept still confronts code maintenance problem, as the same function may be redundant in several objects. The Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) concept is introduced to hardware design to handle the challenges from the OO concept. To decide whether to switch the hardware design technology from OO to AOP concepts, one has to consider many uncertainties related technology change. The Net Present Value (NPV) is the traditional valuation approach to investment decision, but it does not handle uncertainties directly. The real options approach, which supports the valuation of project investment under uncertainty, is proposed to value the expected payoff of the technology shift from OO to AOP concepts. This paper illustrates how to apply the real options approach to hardware design decision. Insights from applying the real options framework are presented as guidelines in considering the hardware design technology switch.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Options Approach to Hardware Design Decision: Switching from Object-Oriented to Aspect-Oriented Concepts","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Engineering Management Conference","doi":"10.1109/IEMC.2006.4279849","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Engineering Management Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4279778/4279779/04279849.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMC.2006.4279849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4279779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4279849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4279849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Options Approach to Hardware Design Decision: Switching from Object-Oriented to Aspect-Oriented Concepts","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4279849/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9766246","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Options Approach to Hardware Design Decision: Switching from Object-Oriented to Aspect-Oriented Concepts","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IEMC-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043688S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4279778","isNumber":"4279779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279778","xplore-issue":"4279779","articleId":"4279849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4279986,"authors":[{"name":"Kiyoteru Hayama","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Kumamoto National College of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyoteru","lastName":"Hayama","id":"38291791800"},{"name":"Tsutomu Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Control, Kumamoto National College of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsutomu","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37290821800"},{"name":"Yasuyuki Shimada","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Control, Kumamoto National College of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuyuki","lastName":"Shimada","id":"37413043200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1183-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1184-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4279986","dbTime":"70 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit testing","Logic circuits","Programmable logic arrays","Hardware design languages","Engineering students","Assembly","Clocks","Counting circuits","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer science education","electronic engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","logic circuit","field programmable gate array","hardware description language","clock generator","program counter","instruction register","emulator"]}],"abstract":"In this study, experiment set up for engineering students is proposed.
