It is based on design maps, drawn on the basis of a suitable large-signal mathematical model of the transistor, which permit a straightforward search for the load reflection coefficient which provides maximum saturated output power or, alternatively, a good compromise between conflicting gain and output power requirements. This method, besides being accurate enough for most amplifier design problems, is also quite simple to apply in practice, since the numerical computations involved can easily be programmed on a desk-top personal computer. The design procedures were implemented in a Fortran program running on an IBM AT personal computer, requiring 350 kByte RAM and a very short (a few minutes) total computing time. The good agreement between predicted and measured performance confirms the validity of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MELCON.1989.50047","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

An improved method of importance sampling is used for SER estimation in a simulation model of a nonlinear satellite channel. The characteristics of the simulation model are as follows: the modulation can generate an MPSK or MQAM signal; at the inputs of the transponder and the receiver Butterworth or Gauss filters are used; the receiver utilizes a device for optimum phase shift of the carrier; and signal sampling is performed at the optimal moment during the signaling period. This model is also used for the analysis of the influence of other system parameters (e.g. filter type, kind of modulation, and backoff) on the quality of signal transmission.

The SER decreased by about 3-20 times, depending upon cycle time and data type, and the power bus noise increased, but only modestly, at low temperature. These results show that the noise and SER do not preclude high-speed cryogenic DRAM operation. Compensation of increased inductive noise by decreased resistive noise is found to be a significant advantage in obtaining speed improvement by temperature reduction, rather than by room-temperature circuit and device techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/LTSE.1989.50171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LTSE.1989.50171","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Low Temperature Semiconductor Electronics,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Low Temperature Semiconductor Electronics,","pdfPath":"/iel2/868/1836/00050171.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Low temperature SER and noise in a high speed DRAM","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3568732","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low temperature SER and noise in a high speed DRAM","confLoc":"Burlington, VT, USA","sourcePdf":"00050171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054303S","chronDate":"7-8 Aug 1989","isNumber":"1836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"868","citationCount":"1","articleId":"50171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50269,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.P.

The authors describe their approach to monitoring and demonstrate how it can be used to support the testing and debugging of real-time distributed computing systems. Essentially, the monitoring system supports different abstraction levels of monitoring according to application purposes. It can monitor process-level activities (e.g. procedure calls) as well as instruction-level activities (e.g. step-by-step instruction trace).

The features of the MBT trigger circuit are a logic trigger mode without using any additional pins and practical use of counter circuits. The essence of trigger mode selection is that two pulses are for MBT set and three pulses are for MBT reset. In this way, a logic trigger mode that does not use NC pins is especially effective as a 4-Mb SRAM. In addition, the proposed scheme is able to act as a logic trigger for an MBT circuit.

This architecture has been realized by the introduction of a chopper-type comparator with three input terminals which makes both coarse and fine comparisons by itself. The A/D converter has two 8-b sub/A/D converters which employ this new architecture, and they are pipelined to improve the conversion rate. Good experimental results have been obtained.

By exploiting the advantages presented by the integration of both bipolar and CMOS devices within the same technology, the comparator dissipates less power than conventional bipolar designs without sacrificing operating speed. The comparator includes an input stage that combines MOS sampling with a bipolar regenerative amplifier. This stage dissipates no static power and, because the amplification is provided by a bipolar differential pair, no offset cancellation is needed to achieve 8-b precision. Furthermore, the need for preamplification and the attendant power-delay penalty associated with preamplifier overdrive recovery are avoided. An experimental version of the comparator, consisting of the BiCMOS regenerative input stage followed by a current-switched latch, has been integrated in a 0.8- mu m BiCMOS technology with an area of 140*75 mu m. This circuit performs comparisons to a precision of 8 b at rates up to 200 MHz.

The parasitic junction capacitance of a transistor is the major factor limiting the bandwidth particularly for low-power amplifiers. In addition to the pole at the input node, the pole at the output node may become dominant in low-power amplifiers, which use high-speed bipolar transistors. A parasitic capacitance compensation technique to expand the bandwidth in this type of amplifier is discussed. This technique compensates for both capacitances at the input and output nodes and enhances the bandwidth and the gain-bandwidth product. The measured data demonstrate that this technique expands the bandwidth to about twice that of a conventional differential amplifier. In addition, circuit simulation predicts that this technique expands the bandwidth by about 40% over a conventional peaking technique. A stable frequency response without any overpeaking or oscillation problem has been achieved by utilizing the parasitic junction capacitances of dummy transistors as the compensation capacitance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3671611","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A low-power wide-band amplifier using a new parasitic capacitance compensation technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power wide-band amplifier using a new parasitic capacitance compensation technique","sourcePdf":"00050304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027947S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"30","articleId":"50304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":50305,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

A realized prototype for ISDN applications with a gain bandwidth (GBW) of 5 MHz and with -80-dB THD at 10 kHz for an output current of 20 mA in a load of 81 Omega is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.50313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1839/00050313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.50313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1839","startPage":"265","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS large-swing low-distortion three-stage class AB power amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=50313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS large-swing low-distortion three-stage class AB power amplifier","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3671620","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS large-swing low-distortion three-stage class AB power amplifier","sourcePdf":"00050313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037076S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"73","articleId":"50313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50316,"authors":[{"name":"E.

These dependencies present serious difficulties in the design of many GaAs integrated circuits, since the small-signal voltage gain in analog circuits and the propagation delay in digital circuits depend on g/sub ds/, and no accurate simulation model is available. A semiempirical model for the frequency-dependent parameters in GaAs depletion-mode MESFETs is presented.

Kabamba (1987) is extended to the control of linear time-invariant systems with unknown parameters. The idea of Kabamba's approach is to periodically sample the plant output and define the control as the sampled output plus a discrete-time reference, each multiplied by an individual modulating function. Such a control makes it possible to assign an arbitrary discrete-time transfer function for the sampled closed-loop system and does not make assumptions on the plant other than controllability and observability. The authors propose an indirect adaptive controller which is based on this approach and estimates the modulating functions online. In particular, the control is modified so that persistent excitation of the continuous-time plant is ensured without making an assumption on the reference signal, and discrete-time asymptotic model-following is nevertheless obtained. The only assumptions on the plant are minimality, for the continuous and sampled plant, and known order.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Control systems","Programmable control","Transfer functions","Controllability","Observability","Sampling methods","Erbium","Automatic control","Poles and zeros"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","model reference adaptive control systems","sampled data systems","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time MRAC","model reference adaptive control","continuous-time systems","sampled-data hold functions","Kabamba's approach","transfer function","sampled closed-loop system","controllability","observability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/9.50351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/1840/00050351.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.50351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-time model reference adaptive control for continuous-time systems using generalized sampled-data hold functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=50351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-time model reference adaptive control for continuous-time systems using generalized sampled-data hold functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50351/","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3662989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-time model reference adaptive control for continuous-time systems using generalized sampled-data hold functions","sourcePdf":"00050351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024994S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"37","articleId":"50351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":50353,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To do so, they must simultaneously exchange their commitments to C. Since simultaneous exchange is usually impossible in practice, protocols are needed to approximate simultaneity by exchanging partial commitments in piece-by-piece manner. During such a protocol, one party or another may have a slight advantage; a fair protocol keeps this advantage within acceptable limits. A new protocol is proposed. It is fair in the sense that, at any stage in its execution, the conditional probability that one party cannot commit both parties to the contract given that the other party can, is close to zero. This is true even if A and B have vastly different computing powers and is proved under very weak cryptographic assumptions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3652935","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A fair protocol for signing contracts","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fair protocol for signing contracts","sourcePdf":"00050372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040841S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"169","articleId":"50372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50375,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

The approach is based on paralleling the input and output of complementary unipolar current-mirror cells. Each cell has a fixed current gain determined by the ratio of two resistors. A differential input voltage-to-current circuit drives the cell array. The design avoids the need for a single low-resistance current-sensing resistor and the attendant problems inherent in such resistors. Although the concept is still under development, a prototype of the cell-based transconductance amplifier was implemented with ten positive and ten negative current cells to gain some experimental familiarity with the approach in addition to providing verification of computer simulation results. The prototype transconductance amplifier is DC coupled, has a 3-dB bandwidth of about 750 kHz, and can deliver up to 35 A RMS (root mean square) at 100 kHz with an output compliance voltage of 5 V RMS. Other important characteristics such as output-load regulation and DC offsets are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transconductance","Broadband amplifiers","Resistors","Voltage","Circuits","Virtual prototyping","Computer simulation","Prototypes","Bandwidth","Root mean square"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant current sources","differential amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","current source","wide-band transconductance amplifier","paralleling","complementary unipolar current-mirror cells","differential input voltage-to-current circuit","computer simulation","output-load regulation","DC offsets","750 kHz","100 kHz","5 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.50413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/1842/00050413.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.50413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-current very wide-band transconductance amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=50413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high-current very wide-band transconductance amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50413/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3652970","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-current very wide-band transconductance amplifier","sourcePdf":"00050413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04071S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"5","articleId":"50413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":50419,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-C.

To overcome the shortcoming of the most often used model and to extend the reflection model for computer color vision, an examination is made of the light reflection problem using the bidirectional spectral-reflectance distribution function (BSRDF) to specify both incident- and reflected-beam geometries. It is shown that the product form can still be retained for a polychromatic light source under two lighting conditions: the light source is collimated; or the spectral factor and the geometric factor can be separated for both the light source and the BSRDF of the surface. The reflection model is then applied to the formulation of a neutral-interface-reflection model, which is tested experimentally. The results show the adequacy of this type of model for surfaces of some material compositions, e.g. plastics, plant leaves, painted surfaces, orange peels, and some glossy cloth, but not for others, e.g. colored paper and some ceramics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.50626","startPage":"402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1848/00050626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.50626","endPage":"409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling light reflection for computer color vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Modeling light reflection for computer color vision","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3663313","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling light reflection for computer color vision","sourcePdf":"00050626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043604S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"123","articleId":"50626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":50663,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Simulations and experiments show that positional and accelerometric feedback, combined with a proportional-derivative element acting on the position error, is a viable solution in the less stable situation when feedback is being taken only from the manipulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3638532","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feedforward and feedback control of a flexible robotic arm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedforward and feedback control of a flexible robotic arm","sourcePdf":"00050663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056853S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"31","articleId":"50663","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50664,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

Test results are presented for four algorithms: z-buffer gradient, gray-level gradient, adaptive gray-level gradient, and marching cubes with two extensions. It was found that gray-level gradient shading and marching cubes did not differ greatly, except for thin objects, where adaptive gray-level gradient shading was better. Transparent visualization using transparent gray-level gradient shading is examined. It is shown that although there is no way to assure the fidelity of transparent shading, it is useful when no other surface at all can be determined. Use of a combination of shading methods appears to yield the best visualization of the respective objects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Biomedical imaging","Testing","Tomography","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image quality","Pixel","Image segmentation","Mathematics","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent visualisation","medical 3D-rendering algorithms","surface-shading algorithms","computer-simulated test objects","z-buffer gradient","gray-level gradient","adaptive gray-level gradient","gray-level gradient shading"]}],"doi":"10.1109/38.50672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/38/1852/00050672.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.50672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of medical 3D-rendering algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=50672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of medical 3D-rendering algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50672/","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3638475","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of medical 3D-rendering algorithms","sourcePdf":"00050672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04516S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"164","articleId":"50672","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":50695,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The model incorporates the inherent and apparent properties of the propagation of light in water. An image is approximated as a linear superposition of several image components. The model has been used to simulate the relative advantages of different camera/light configurations. The results indicate that extremely large gains in image contrast can be obtained by careful design of beam patterns and the manipulation of camera and light locations. The performance of range-gated systems is explored, and it is demonstrated that these systems are presently power limited. In order to obtain better quality images at larger distances, an imaging configuration which consists of scanning an incoherent light beam across the field of view of a camera is proposed. The incoherent light-scanning system is shown to have advantages over both conventional imaging techniques and range-gated methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","volume":"15","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3671918","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Computer modeling and the design of optimal underwater imaging systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer modeling and the design of optimal underwater imaging systems","sourcePdf":"00050695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028692S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"348","articleId":"50695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":50707,"authors":[{"name":"M.-S.

High receiver sensitivities for PSK systems were achieved. The applicability of the Mach-Zehnder modulator as a phase modulator for 1.2-Gb/s DPSK is also demonstrated. A 1.2-Gb/s DPSK transmission of over 100 km, using polarization diversity with novel polarization-insensitive automatic frequency control in an attempt to overcome signal fading caused by polarization fluctuation in the transmitting fiber, is also described. A receiver sensitivity of less than -42.8 dBm and varying within 1.4 dB for all states of polarization was achieved.

This phase noise can be accommodated if the receiver is correctly designed, i.e. if nonsynchronous (envelope or square-law) IF demodulation is used and sufficient IF bandwidth is provided. It is difficult to analyze the performance of a coherent optical receiver when the signals are corrupted by phase noise. The central theoretical problem arising from filtering a signal with phase noise is defined in a particular form which permits the derivation of the forward or Fokker-Planck partial differential equation for probability density of the output voltage of the receiver. The results are used to discuss the IF bandwidth required for optical heterodyne receivers for amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of phase noise in weakly coherent systems: a new and accurate approach","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.50730","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1855/00050730.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.50730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=50730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Impact of phase noise in weakly coherent systems: a new and accurate approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3652331","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of phase noise in weakly coherent systems: a new and accurate approach","sourcePdf":"00050730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06416S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"55","articleId":"50730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50733,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Chromatic dispersion is successfully compensated with a stripline delay for CPFSK transmission at 4 and 6 Gb/s over 200 km of 1.3- mu m zero-dispersion single-mode fiber at 1.55 mu m.

In particular, the temporal and statistical behavior of pseudonoise bursts generated by spectral phase coding of ultrashort optical pulses is discussed. the analysis is motivated by recent experiments that demonstrate high-resolution spectral phase coding of picosecond and femtosecond pulses and suggest the possibility of ultrahigh speed code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communications using this technique. The evolution of coherent ultrashort pulses into low intensity pseudonoise bursts as a function of the degree of phase coding is traced. The results are utilized to analyze the performance of a proposed CDMA optical communications system based upon encoding and decoding of ultrashort light pulses. The bit error rate (BER) is derived as a function of data rate, number of users, and receiver threshold, and the performance characteristics are discussed for a variety of system parameters. It is found that performance improves greatly with increasing code length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.50743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.50743","endPage":"491","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1855/00050743.pdf","startPage":"478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent ultrashort light pulse code-division multiple access communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50743/","displayDocTitle":"Coherent ultrashort light pulse code-division multiple access communication systems","volume":"8","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3652342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent ultrashort light pulse code-division multiple access communication systems","sourcePdf":"00050743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068132S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"359","articleId":"50743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":50758,"authors":[{"name":"N.

When cloud shadows move across a PV array, the array's power output is reduced. It resumes full production when the shadow moves away. The utility must follow these changes with other types of generation. Under certain cloud conditions, these changes can be large and fast.

The effectiveness of small-sized magnetic energy storage (MES) units (both superconducting and normal loss types) for this application is shown, and means of best utilizing the small energy storage capacity of such units to improve the load-frequency dynamics of large power areas are suggested. The proposed method of improving the load frequency control of power systems has the advantage that it does not require the governor or any other part of the power system to perform any sophisticated control action. The control logic suggested for this purpose takes the area control error as its input and uses inductor current deviation feedback. In a power system with a SMES (superconducting MES) unit, the optimal setting of the integrator gain is altered to a higher value. With the suggested control measure, SMES units of 4-6 MJ capacity would suffice in reducing the maximum deviations of frequency and tie-line power flow by about 40% in power areas of 1000-2000 MW capacity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50811/","volume":"5","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3655090","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of magnetic energy storage unit as load-frequency stabilizer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of magnetic energy storage unit as load-frequency stabilizer","sourcePdf":"50811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160548S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"51","articleId":"50811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50815,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

A novel method for analyzing the steady-state and transient currents in the stator, rotor, and damper windings of a large generator is discussed, and the application of the method to five classes of problems of practical importance is described. These are (1) internal phase-to-phase fault in a two-circuit machine; (2) 180 degrees out-of-phase synchronization; (3) three-phase short circuit at generator terminals; (4) clearing of a three-phase system fault; and (5) unbalanced steady-state negative phase sequence load of 6%. The authors show the individual damper bar currents and energies or electric power loadings for these cases and, for one example, the time variations of stator and damper winding currents. The investigation was conducted on a standard two-pole generator that was designed for 60 Hz operation and has a rating of 700 MW.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3655094","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to determine transient generator winding and damper currents in case of internal and external faults and abnormal operation.

By this technique, the rotor speed and/or position of a DC motor can follow any arbitrarily selected track (or trajectory). The developed control strategy is adaptive and robust, i.e. insensitive to system variations, such as load changes, noise, and disturbances. This results in what is known as a high-performance drive system, which is required in applications such as robotics, actuation, and manipulation. The developed drive system was implemented and tested in the laboratory. The system was examined under various uncertainties such as load variations, noisy measurements, and field disturbances. All lab tests confirm the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

The first method is the traditional mechanical measurement using an accelerator; the second method involves an electrical technique using search coils as flux sensors; the remaining techniques employ either terminal voltage and current or input power and speed. Measurements of instantaneous electromagnetic torques of a medium-size 25 HP salient pole synchronous motor using these methods are compared with simulation results obtained from a full-order model as well as with a quasi-linear algebraic approximation. It is shown that torque measurement using search coils in the stator windings gives the best correlation with the simulation results, followed by a modified terminal measurement based on terminal voltage and current. The accelerometer method give the poorest results in that it is unable to capture the low-frequency components of the electromagnetic torques. It is also demonstrated by simulation that the approximate method for calculation of pulsating torques based on a quasi-linear model of the motor gives an estimate comparable to that of the full-order model, particularly for large machines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.50829","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/1859/00050829.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.50829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"176","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and computation of starting torque pulsations of salient pole synchronous motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=50829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and computation of starting torque pulsations of salient pole synchronous motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50829/","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3655108","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and computation of starting torque pulsations of salient pole synchronous motors","sourcePdf":"50829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038942S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"34","articleId":"50829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":50833,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Rahman","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37279801600"},{"name":"A.M.

Frequency-tunable two-electrode distributed-feedback (DFB) laser transmitters produce distorted FSK spectra due to nonuniform FM response for modulation frequencies above approximately 200 Mb/s. The frequency-domain properties of the laser are related directly to the time-domain properties of the transmitted data stream. The critical dependence on the FFP passband width and center frequency location for undistorted signal recovery is shown. By optimizing these parameters, the data transmission rate can be increased while keeping the power penalty due to signal distortion below 1 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.50896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.50896","startPage":"223","endPage":"226","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/1862/00050896.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1.2 Gb/s closely-spaced FDMA-FSK direct-detection star network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"1.2 Gb/s closely-spaced FDMA-FSK direct-detection star network","publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3656367","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50896/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1.2 Gb/s closely-spaced FDMA-FSK direct-detection star network","sourcePdf":"00050896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035781S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"16","articleId":"50896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":50903,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The basis of the Bubba design is a scalable shared-nothing architecture which can scale up to thousands of nodes. Data are declustered across the nodes (i.e. horizontally partitioned via hashing or range partitioning) and operations are executed at those nodes containing relevant data. In this way, parallelism can be exploited within individual transactions as well as among multiple concurrent transactions to improve throughput and response times for data-intensive applications. The current Bubba prototype runs on a commercial 40-node multicomputer and includes a parallelizing compiler, distributed transaction management, object management, and a customized version of Unix. The current prototype is described and the major design decisions that went into its construction are discussed. The lessons learned from this prototype and its predecessors are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.50903","startPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/1863/00050903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.50903","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prototyping Bubba, a highly parallel database system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Prototyping Bubba, a highly parallel database system","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3645035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prototyping Bubba, a highly parallel database system","sourcePdf":"00050903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076717S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"208","articleId":"50903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50904,"authors":[{"name":"H.-J.

The project is aimed at providing data management support for advanced applications, such as geo-scientific information systems and office automation. Similar to the dichotomy of RSS and RDS in System R, a layered architectural approach was pursued: a storage management kernel serves as the lowest common denominator of the requirements of the various applications classes, and a family of application-oriented front-ends provides semantically richer functions on top of the kernel. The lessons that were learned from building the DASDBS system are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on the following issues: the role of nested relations, the experiences with using object buffers for coupling the system with the programming-language environment and the learning process in implementing multilevel transactions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","publicationDate":"March 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3645036","volume":"2","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The DASDBS project: objectives, experiences, and future prospects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The DASDBS project: objectives, experiences, and future prospects","sourcePdf":"00050904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081585S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"21","articleId":"50904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":50905,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Gamma is a relational database machine currently operating on an Intel iPSC/2 hypercube with 32 processors and 32 disk drives. Gamma employs three key technical ideas which enable the architecture to be scaled to hundreds of processors. First, all relations are horizontally partitioned across multiple disk drives, enabling relations to be scanned in parallel. Second, parallel algorithms based on hashing are used to implement the complex relational operators, such as join and aggregate functions. Third, dataflow scheduling techniques are used to coordinate multioperator queries. By using these techniques, it is possible to control the execution of very complex queries with minimal coordination. The design of the Gamma software is described and a thorough performance evaluation of the iPSC/s hypercube version of Gamma is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.50905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/1863/00050905.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.50905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Gamma database machine project","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/50905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"The Gamma database machine project","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3645037","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Gamma database machine project","sourcePdf":"00050905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046861S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"329","articleId":"50905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":50908,"authors":[{"name":"O.

It is shown to be a viable technique for the fabrication of advanced bipolar transistors. The use of amorphous instead of polycrystalline silicon as the emitter contact material results in a shallower emitter-base junction and little effect of the boron diffusion on the obtained arsenic profile. The narrowing of the base yields a higher intrinsic base resistance for the same number of carriers leading to a decrease in current gain for the same intrinsic base resistance. The different processing of double diffusion compared to base implantation may also lead to a loss in emitter efficiency. Nevertheless uniformity of the basewidth seems to be excellent and good high-frequency characteristics (up to f/sub T/=15 GHz) are obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/BIPOL.1988.51064","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 Bipolar Circuits and Technology Meeting,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 Bipolar Circuits and Technology Meeting,","pdfPath":"/iel2/744/1865/00051064.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIPOL.1988.51064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin base formation by double diffused polysilicon technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=51064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Sep 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/51064/","displayDocTitle":"Thin base formation by double diffused polysilicon technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3318479","conferenceDate":"12-12 Sept. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin base formation by double diffused polysilicon technology","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00051064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026431S","chronDate":"12-13 Sep 1988","isNumber":"1865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"744","citationCount":"7","articleId":"51064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":51067,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Conclusions are drawn as to the problem areas for future work, and to the implications on neural algorithms and architecture of the constraints imposed by hardware.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/1151/1872/00051924.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 First IEE International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, (Conf.

Parallelism on input neurons is achieved for output neuron states evaluation and for synaptic weights updating. The latter follows a Hebb-like local formula. The digital realization guarantees exact integer calculations. According to simulations and theoretical considerations, 16-bit precision on the weights should yield enough accuracy for the foreseen applications. An arrangement of several chips and adapted programming can be used to emulate most of the formal neural nets. The architecture is able to implement most of the learning schemes, including the minimum overlap rule, Kohonen's self-organizing map, and the error back-propagation. The chip is fully cascadable, allowing any size and architecture of neural nets. A typical on-chip running time for updating one output neuron state (resolution stage), or all synaptic weights related to one neuron (learning stage) is less than 250 ns for binary neurons in a Hopfield network. Larger networks can be built with several circuits, and with transputer microprocessors these chips could realize fine grain parallel machines that achieve computing times shorter by several orders of magnitude than those of conventional computers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/1151/1872/00051931.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"66","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 First IEE International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, (Conf.

In order to obtain an estimate of the number of hidden units for a fully connected net with n output units, it is necessary to obtain an estimate of the number of 'conflicts' contained in the individual binary responses that must be learned by each output unit. A conflict is a set of input/output relationships that require incompatible weight solutions when the responses of an output unit are learned on a single layer perceptron. The estimate produced is data-dependent, since the number of conflicts for an output unit depends on the specific responses of the output unit to the input vectors contained in the training set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1872","startPage":"120","endPage":"124","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 First IEE International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, (Conf.

Broomhead developed (1988) the opinion that most current feedforward layered neural networks perform a curve fitting operation in a high-dimensional space. To create the analogy, it was necessary to generalise earlier papers' assumptions, and so a mechanism for choosing radial basis functions was needed. The method involves optimisation. It is concluded that nonlinear optimisation of the first layer parameters is beneficial only when a minimal network is required to solve a given problem, since the same generalisation performance can be achieved simply by using more centres and adapting only the final layer by linear optimisation. The processing time is many orders of magnitude longer when full adaptation was used. Nonlinear optimisation cannot be used to improve the generalisation performance of the network. Choice of the nonlinearity is not crucial.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/51953/","accessionNumber":"3578558","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive radial basis function nonlinearities, and the problem of generalisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive radial basis function nonlinearities, and the problem of generalisation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00051953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025859S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct 1989","isNumber":"1872","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1151","citationCount":"34","articleId":"51953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":51979,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

It includes the effects of both gain saturation and carrier-density modulation. The carrier-density modulation, occurring as a result of beating among the neighboring channels, is responsible for nondegenerate four-wave mixing. This nonlinear phenomenon not only unequalizes the channel gains but also generates new sidebands on both sides of the boundary channels. The effects of four-wave mixing on multichannel amplification are illustrated by considering the 30-channel case in detail. The theory is useful for quantifying the amplifier-induced crosstalk and identifying the operating conditions for reducing such crosstalk in multichannel coherent communication systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.52126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/1875/00052126.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"505","doi":"10.1109/3.52126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of a four-wave mixing on multichannel amplification in semiconductor laser amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Effect of a four-wave mixing on multichannel amplification in semiconductor laser amplifiers","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3689613","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of a four-wave mixing on multichannel amplification in semiconductor laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00052126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031225S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"22","articleId":"52126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":52159,"authors":[{"name":"H.

By merging circuit and layout design into a single design process, analog circuits can be optimally designed taking layout parasitics fully into account. Using the method, a CMOS operational-amplifier compiler (OAC) has been developed. Given a set of performance specifications and process parameters, OAC generates a layout with circuit performance optimized to meet specified performance constraints. A procedural layout technique is employed to generate a compact and practical layout. A nonlinear optimization method for device sizing which relies on the results of simulations based on the circuit extracted from the layout is applied. Design experiments have shown that OAC can produce satisfactory results with respect to both circuit performance and layout density.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3680852","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Operational-amplifier compilation with performance optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operational-amplifier compilation with performance optimization","sourcePdf":"00052171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046264S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"66","articleId":"52171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52175,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The networks of the chips are pipelined and systolic at bit level and based on odd/even transposition sorting. The chips are implemented in 3- mu m standard CMOS using full-custom VLSI design techniques. The exact median of elements, in a window size w=9 with arbitrary word length L, can be found using only one extensible median filter chip. The filter can be extended to arbitrary window size and word lengths by using many chips. Simulation results show that the extensible median filter chip can be clocked up to 40 MHz and can generate 30/L megamedians per second.

In one of them, called the effective one-shot gate address buffer, the input address is provided to the gate of a transistor, and a gating transistor located between the input node of the buffer and the transistor is controlled by an equivalent one-shot pulse with sufficient high level. This reduces the row address hold time and also RAS-bar access time. A standby current limitation circuit eliminates the standby current at the input stage of the buffer even with TTL-level input voltage. Test-mode hidden refresh is achieved without test-mode resetting, which enhances the testability and relaxes the test sequence. The RAM employs a 0.8- mu m twin-well CMOS process technology and a stacked capacitor with a storage capacitance of 35 fF. A 58-ns RAS-bar access time and a 65-mA active current at 160-ns cycle are achieved in a die size of a 6.84 mm*14.95 mm.

The result is a simpler design in that each comparator is a CMOS inverter and the resistor ladder is eliminated. The ADC was fabricated in CMOS/SOS with comparator channel lengths of 0.5 mu m and digital device channel lengths of 0.25 mu m. Measurements of signal-to-noise ratio and analog bandwidth indicate that the ADC can function as a Nyquist converter at sampling frequencies up to 400 MHz. Better than 3-b resolution was observed for a wide range of conditions, including sampling rates above 1 GHz. The power dissipation apart from the output buffers (driving 50- Omega loads) was less than 100 mW, even at sampling rates >or=1 GHz. This 370 MOSFET circuit is one of the most complex ICs yet built with 0.25- mu m CMOS. A promising application is in oversampled ADC architectures, where this circuit would function effectively as an internal high-speed quantizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.52185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.52185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1876","startPage":"562","endPage":"571","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1876/00052185.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52185","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog-digital conversion","Sampling methods","MOSFET circuits","CMOS technology","Threshold voltage","Inverters","Resistors","Frequency measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","ion implantation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash ADC","submicron devices","deep-submicrometer","analog-to-digital converter","focused-ion-beam implants","FIB","multiple MOSFET threshold voltages","CMOS inverter","CMOS/SOS","comparator channel lengths","digital device channel lengths","Nyquist converter","oversampled ADC architectures","internal high-speed quantizer","0.25 micron","0.5 micron","400 MHz","100 mW","1 GHz","Si-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A deep-submicrometer analog-to-digital converter using focused-ion-beam implants","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3680858","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52185/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep-submicrometer analog-to-digital converter using focused-ion-beam implants","sourcePdf":"00052185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050137S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","articleId":"52185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":52186,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It is found that the behavior of the propagation delay is quite linear, and therefore analytical propagation delay expressions for ECL and CML circuits are derived using a sensitivity analysis. The validity of the expressions is checked by SPICE simulations and comparison to experimental data published in the literature, and agreement is within 5%. The expressions indicate that there is an optimum value of load resistance for logic circuits in order to achieve a minimum propagation delay. For present technology, logic circuits for silicon transistors can operate at the current density corresponding to maximum f/sub T/, and logic circuits for AlGaAs-GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) should operate at a current density lower than that of maximum f/sub T/. Therefore, it is important to increase the collector current density of maximum f/sub T/ for silicon bipolar circuits, or to decrease the base resistance R/sub B/ and the forward transit time tau /sub F/ for HBT circuits, in order to increase the circuit speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3680859","displayDocTitle":"Accurate analytical delay expressions for ECL and CML circuits and their applications to optimizing high-speed bipolar circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate analytical delay expressions for ECL and CML circuits and their applications to optimizing high-speed bipolar circuits","sourcePdf":"00052186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057144S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"70","articleId":"52186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":52187,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The former emphasizes the connectivity specification, whereas the latter must also consider module shape and size. Global routing based on a method of successive cuts on a chip is discussed.

It is indicated how digital signal processing differs from numerical data processing, including the consequences for the synthesis tools. On the basis of a broad range of DSP applications, four classes of architectures are then distinguished to serve as templates for four different synthesis systems. Although each of these four silicon compilers is tuned to a specific class of applications in order to generate area-efficient chips, they all accept as input the same behavioral DSP specification. The four selected architectural styles are best characterized by hard-wired bit-serial data-paths, microcoded multiprocessors, cooperating bit-parallel data-paths, and regular arrays. The characteristics of the first three architectures are treated in more detail in a discussion of three different Cathedral synthesis environments for their respective design. A fourth Cathedral environment, aiming at the synthesis of regular arrays, is still in an early stage of development and is not discussed. The claims for the compilers are substantiated by typical designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.52215","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/1878/00052215.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.52215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture-driven synthesis techniques for VLSI implementation of DSP algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52215/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture-driven synthesis techniques for VLSI implementation of DSP algorithms","volume":"78","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3693430","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture-driven synthesis techniques for VLSI implementation of DSP algorithms","sourcePdf":"00052215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060308S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"93","articleId":"52215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":52216,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Convexity makes numerical solution effective: it is possible to determine whether or not there is a controller that achieves a given set of specifications. Thus, the limit of achievable performance can be computed. To provide a context for the material presented, a brief overview of control engineering is given. A broad outline of various approaches to control design for linear and time-invariant systems is presented, including their advantages and disadvantages, for purposes of comparison with the approach presented. It is shown that many performance specifications have natural and useful geometric interpretations, and the notion of a closed-loop convex design specification is defined. The performance requirement that the closed-loop system be stable is discussed. It is shown that many performance specifications can be expressed as convex constraints on closed-loop performance specifications, and how some of these can be expressed as convex constraints on closed-loop transfer matrices is examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/1879/00052229.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"574","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.52229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.52229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear controller design: limits of performance via convex optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Control systems","Actuators","Signal processing","Control engineering","Process control","Sensor systems","Mathematical model","Signal design","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system analysis","control system synthesis","linear systems","optimisation","performance index","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance limits","convex optimization","linear control systems","closed-loop maps","numerical solution","time-invariant systems","closed-loop convex design specification","closed-loop transfer matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"Linear controller design: limits of performance via convex optimization","volume":"78","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3704500","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear controller design: limits of performance via convex optimization","sourcePdf":"00052229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116017S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"55","articleId":"52229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52238,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

The key step in this procedure is a formulation of the so-called mixed-potential electric field integral equation (MPIE) that is amenable to an existing advanced solution technique developed for objects in free space and that employs the method of moments in conjunction with a triangular-patch model of the arbitrary surface. Hence, the goal is to immediately increase analysis capabilities in electromagnetics, yet remain compatible with the large existing base of knowledge concerning the solution of surface integral equations. Three alternative forms of the MPIE in plane-stratified media are developed, and their properties are discussed. One of the developed MPIEs is used to analyze scatterers and antennas of arbitrary shape that penetrate the interface between contiguous dielectric half-spaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1880/00052240.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.52240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.52240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic scattering and radiation by surfaces of arbitrary shape in layered media.

The basic technique is to apply the equivalence principle and transform the original problem into interior and exterior problems, which are coupled on the exterior dielectric body surface through the continuities of the tangential electric field and magnetic field. The interior problem involving inhomogeneous medium is solved by the FEM, and the exterior problem is solved by the MM. The coupling of the interior and exterior problems on their common surface results in a matrix equation for the equivalent current sources for the interior and exterior problems. Combining advantages of both methods allows complicated inhomogeneous problems with arbitrary geometry to be treated in a straightforward manner. The validity and accuracy of the formulation are checked by two-dimensional numerical results, which are compared with the exact eigenfunction solution, the unimoment solution, and Richmond's pure moment solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00052246.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1880/00052246.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.52246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.52246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupling of finite element and moment methods for electromagnetic scattering from inhomogeneous objects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic coupling","Finite element methods","Moment methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic wave absorption","Nonhomogeneous media","Dielectrics","Magnetic fields","Nonuniform electric fields","Surface treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic absorption","electromagnetic scattering","inhomogeneous objects","hybrid formulation","method of moments","finite element method","equivalence principle","exterior dielectric body surface","tangential electric field","magnetic field","interior problem","exterior problem","matrix equation","equivalent current sources"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Coupling of finite element and moment methods for electromagnetic scattering from inhomogeneous objects","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3671668","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupling of finite element and moment methods for electromagnetic scattering from inhomogeneous objects","sourcePdf":"00052246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057158S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"100","articleId":"52246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52247,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The formulas can be used to predict the radiation pattern of a general class of leaky-wave antennas, consisting of a finite-size source which excites a radially propagating leaky wave on some planar surface. Leaky-wave antennas consisting of antenna elements embedded in dielectric layers (microstrip elements) fall into this category. Using the equivalence principle, formulas are derived for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) leaky waves with arbitrary propagation constants. The formulas allow for radiation from cylindrical apertures of arbitrary size, so that the effect of truncating the supporting planar surface with an absorbing material can be determined. Particular attention is devoted to the case of a leaky wave for which the real and imaginary parts of the complex propagation constant are equal, since this type of wave has been shown to be responsible for broadside radiation in certain leaky-wave antennas comprised of dielectric layers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1881/00052266.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.52266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.52266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation from cylindrical leaky waves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leaky wave antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Surface waves","Microstrip antennas","Propagation constant","Antennas and propagation","Tellurium","Apertures","Dielectric materials","Magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transverse electric waves","transverse magnetic waves","cylindrical leaky waves","far-infrared radiation pattern","planar surface","leaky-wave antennas","equivalence principle","arbitrary propagation constants","cylindrical apertures","complex propagation constant","broadside radiation","dielectric layers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Radiation from cylindrical leaky waves","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3689339","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation from cylindrical leaky waves","sourcePdf":"00052266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036643S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"102","articleId":"52266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":52267,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chung Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Chung Yeh","id":"37087337180"},{"name":"Wun-Der Wang","affiliation":["Navy Electronics and Communication School, China"],"lastName":"Wun-Der Wang","id":"37087757404"},{"name":"T.-H.S.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system are given. An explicit multirate feedback law that requires the solution of an algebraic discrete Riccati equation is presented. Such control is simple and can be easily implemented by digital computers. When applied to linear time-invariant systems, multirate optimal feedback optimal control provides a satisfactory response even if the state is sampled relatively slowly. Compared to the classical single-rate sampled-data feedback in which the state is always sampled at the same rate, the multirate system can provide a better response with a considerable reduction in the optimal cost.

The motivation behind this research is to explore more reliable methods of deriving control for multi-degree-of-freedom arm prostheses. A discrete Hopfield network is used to calculate the time series parameter for a moving average MES model. It is demonstrated that the Hopfield network is capable of generating the same time series parameters as those produced by the conventional sequential least-squares algorithm. Furthermore, it can be extended to applications utilizing larger amounts of data, and possibly to higher-order time series models, without significant degradation in computational efficiency. The second neural network implementation involves using a two-layer perceptron for classifying a single-site MES on the basis of two features, the first time series parameter and the signal power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/1883/00052324.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.52324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.52324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1883","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of neural networks to myoelectric signal analysis: a preliminary study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Signal analysis","Muscles","Prosthetics","Neural prosthesis","Multilayer perceptrons","Least squares methods","Laser sintering","Degradation","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","bioelectric potentials","muscle","neural nets","neurophysiology","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","myoelectric signal analysis","control","multi-degree-of-freedom arm prostheses","discrete Hopfield network","time series parameter","moving average MES model","computational efficiency","two-layer perceptron","first time series parameter","signal power"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Amputation","Arm","Arm","Electromyography","Humans","Male","Models, Neurological","Muscle Contraction","Nerve Net","Nervous System Physiology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"The application of neural networks to myoelectric signal analysis: a preliminary study","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3689425","pubMedId":"2328997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of neural networks to myoelectric signal analysis: a preliminary study","sourcePdf":"00052324.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043644S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"163","articleId":"52324","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52325,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

W is a matrix of synaptic weights, F is a nonlinear function, and p is a vector (constant or slowly varying over time) of inputs to the units. If the map WF(x) is a contraction, then the system has a unique equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable; consequently, the network acts as a stable encoder in that its steady-state response to an input is independent of the initial state of the network. Considered are some relatively mild restrictions on W and F(x), involving the eigenvalues of W and the derivative of F, that are sufficient to ensure that WF(x) is a contraction. It is shown that, in the linear case with spatially homogeneous synaptic weights, the eigenvalues of W are simply related to the Fourier transform of the connection pattern. This relation makes it possible, given cortical activity patterns as measured by autoradiographic labeling, to construct a pattern of synaptic weights which produces steady-state patterns showing similar frequency characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.52325","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/1883/00052325.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"242","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.52325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability in contractive nonlinear neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"Stability in contractive nonlinear neural networks","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3680863","pubMedId":"2328998","publicationDate":"March 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability in contractive nonlinear neural networks","sourcePdf":"00052325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039337S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"141","articleId":"52325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":52331,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The magnitude of the joint moment was examined as a function of the stimulation pulse frequency for the six muscles tested. Parabolic curves were found to fit this relationship best, the magnitude of the moment reaching a maximum at typically 50 Hz and often decreasing at higher frequencies.

A knowledge of the surface strength of processed pressboard in mineral oil under superimposed AC and DC stresses is therefore essential. In this study, the surface strength has been determined experimentally for cylindrical specimens and for three gaps under the influence of superimposed stress in the range of ripple factor from 0.4 to 2.2. The surface strength has also been found under application of AC, DC, lightning and switching impulse voltages. The influence of the interface on the breakdown value of the gap has been found for each of the above types of stresses. It is shown that the surface strength is greatest under lightning impulse voltage, followed by switching impulse, DC and AC voltages. Under DC voltage with ripple the surface exceeds the DC value in the ripple range considered for the 10- and 25-mm gaps. The presence of the interface lowers the breakdown voltage except when either DC or superimposed stresses are applied. For the test configuration considered, the impulse ratio increases with gap length especially under application of lightning impulse voltages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface electric strength of processed pressboard under composite AC and DC and conventional stresses","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/14.52381","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/1886/00052381.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.52381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Surface electric strength of processed pressboard under composite AC and DC and conventional stresses","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3689581","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface electric strength of processed pressboard under composite AC and DC and conventional stresses","sourcePdf":"00052381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034278S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"43","articleId":"52381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52423,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Various SIMOX substrates, such as partially depleted films annealed at low or high temperature and ultrathin films (100 nm), are analyzed and compared. Enhancement- and depletion-mode devices with different doping levels, channel lengths, and geometries are considered. The front and back channels are activated independently in order to assess the electrical quality of both interfaces. Comparison with bulk Si transistors reveals a number of interesting features of SIMOX devices, which are explained using comprehensive models. The advantages of low-temperature operation of SIMOX transistors are related to the decrease in subthreshold swing and leakage, increase in mobility, and reasonable shift of the threshold voltage. The performance of ultra-thin-film devices is excellent over the whole range or temperatures, whereas partially depleted transistors exhibit optimum performance at 77 K.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3671689","volume":"37","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance and physical mechanisms in SIMOX MOS transistors operated at very low temperature","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and physical mechanisms in SIMOX MOS transistors operated at very low temperature","sourcePdf":"00052436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043422S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"64","articleId":"52436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":52439,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

The net functions as an autoassociative memory in which binary numbers corresponding to 28, 56, 112, and 224 are stored. Learning of the weight matrix is carried out with the associative memory algorithm using the delta rule. Phosphorus-doped microcrystalline silicon with a resistivity of 100 to 300 Omega -cm was used for the fabrication of the weight (synapse) resistors. Inverters with a beta of one were used to form negative-weight synapses, and inverters with a beta of 10 were used for the thresholding elements (neurons).

Some unexpected results, such as an anomalous peak during the erasing operation and the influence of the ramp speed on the conduction properties of the thin oxide, which is shown by the Fowler-Nordheim plot of the experimental tunnel current, were also observed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.52445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/1888/00052445.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.52445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1888","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental transient analysis of the tunnel current in EEPROM cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental transient analysis of the tunnel current in EEPROM cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3671696","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental transient analysis of the tunnel current in EEPROM cells","sourcePdf":"00052445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061315S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"45","articleId":"52445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":52461,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The predicted failure rate is less than 150 FITs for an operating temperature of 125 degrees C. The mean time to failure (MTTF) is 10/sup 7/ h with an activation energy of 1.9 eV. The principle failure modes are degradation of IFA bias current and RF gain.

The presence of capacity constraints introduces theoretical and practical problems. The following problem is addressed: given that the peripheral encoders that satisfy these constraints are scalar quantizers, how should they be designed in order that the central test to be performed on their output indices is most powerful? The scheme is called cooperative design-separate encoding since the quantizers process separate observations but have a common goal; they seek to maximize a system-wide performance measure. The Bhattacharyya distance of the joint index space as such a criterion is suggested, and a design algorithm to optimize arbitrarily many quantizers cyclically is proposed. A simplified version of the algorithm, namely an independent design-separate encoding scheme, where the correlation is either absent or neglected for the sake of simplicity, is outlined.

The main result is to show that the minimum distance between received signals is the same as the pulse energy for rates of transmission about 25% beyond the Nyquist rate, which is the best possible result.

The only interference considered is multiple-access interference, and perfect side information is assumed. Bounds on the probability of error for unslotted systems are developed based on the distributions of the maximum and minimum interference levels over the duration of a given packet, and these are employed to develop corresponding bounds on the throughput. The idealized model makes possible the derivation of asymptotic results showing the convergence of these bounds for high traffic levels. The asymptotic performance of the system is seen to be the same as that of the corresponding slotted system. Results for the maximum asymptotic throughput are also obtained. These results show that the asymptotic sum capacity of the channel can be attained using Reed-Solomon coding. All these results are valid for either fixed or exponentially distributed packet lengths. The results indicate that the performance of frequency-hop networks is insensitive both to the distribution of packet lengths and to whether or not transmissions are slotted. It also demonstrates the efficacy of Reed-Solomon coding in combating multiple-access interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limiting performance of frequency-hop random access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.52479","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1889/00052479.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.52479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Limiting performance of frequency-hop random access","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3689383","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limiting performance of frequency-hop random access","sourcePdf":"00052479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029049S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","articleId":"52479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":52483,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The complex electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are calculated from the measured values of S/sub 11/ and S/sub 21/. The measurement system consists of transmit and receive horn lens antennas, a network analyzer, mode transitions, and a computer. Diffraction effects at the edges of the sample are minimized by using spot-focusing lens antennas. Errors due to multiple reflections between antennas via the surface of the sample are corrected by using a free-space TRL (thru, reflect, line) calibration technique. For thin, flexible samples, the sample had to be sandwiched between two half-wavelength (at mid-band) quartz plates to eliminate sagging. Results are reported in the frequency range of 8.6-13.4 GHz for materials such as Teflon, sodium borosilicate glass, and microwave-absorbing materials.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.52520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.52520","startPage":"387","endPage":"394","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/1890/00052520.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-space measurement of complex permittivity and complex permeability of magnetic materials at microwave frequencies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Free-space measurement of complex permittivity and complex permeability of magnetic materials at microwave frequencies","publicationDate":"April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3689458","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52520/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-space measurement of complex permittivity and complex permeability of magnetic materials at microwave frequencies","sourcePdf":"00052520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092399S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"574","articleId":"52520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":52529,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

Extenders are defined as a class of robot manipulators worn by humans to increase mechanical strength while the wearer's intellect remains the central control system for manipulating the extender. The human, in physical contact with the extender, exchanges power and information signals with the extender. The present analysis focuses on the dynamics and control of human-robot interaction in the sense of the transfer of power and information signals. General models for the human, the extender, and the interaction between the human and extender are developed. The stability of the system of human, extender, and the object being manipulated is analyzed, and the conditions for stable maneuvers are derived. An expression for the extender performance is defined to quantify the force augmentation. The trade-off between stability and performance is described.

The element values in the small-signal equivalent circuit model of the MESFETs, the characteristics of the gate and drain transmission lines, and the number of stages are generated to match a specified frequency response by this computer-aided design (CAD) process. The success of this process lies in the fact that it is fully automatic and the only input needed is the desired flat band gain and the 3 dB point. The method itself is sufficiently general that it can be applied to a variety of design problems. Excellent agreement is shown when the distributed amplifier designed is simulated using Touchstone, a popular microwave simulation program.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.52573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1892/00052573.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"349","doi":"10.1109/22.52573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided design of monolithic MESFET distributed amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided design of monolithic MESFET distributed amplifiers","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3689403","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided design of monolithic MESFET distributed amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00052573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032975S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"12","articleId":"52573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":52574,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

Each filter is designed to be insensitive to the failed measurements by decreasing the Kalman gain artificially. Since it is mainly dependent upon the dynamic model and averaged outputs, it can exactly indicate the direction of failures. Even though this concept minimizes the number of filters, it performs the role of analytic redundancy for estimation. As soon as the residual exceeds the predetermined bound, the Kalman filter indicates the possibility of failures. However, since the measurement may show false indication owing to abrupt noises, it must be confirmed several times by the multiple consecutive miscomparison counter, which is strongly dependent on measurement history. Then, if it is not in accordance with other measurements, detailed information on the status of the measurements is provided to help the operator's decision. Various simulations were performed to verify and validate the FDI logic in detecting steam generator and pressurizer instrument failures. It is shown that the FDI technique can detect not only a single failure but also simultaneous common-mode and sequential multiple failures of several direct redundancies. It can correctly estimate the physical states in real time, and the remaining time may be used for control with signal validation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.52605","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1893/00052605.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.52605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instrument failure detection and estimation methodology for the nuclear power plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Instrument failure detection and estimation methodology for the nuclear power plant","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3671716","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instrument failure detection and estimation methodology for the nuclear power plant","sourcePdf":"00052605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038223S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","articleId":"52605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52622,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Two models are discussed: (1) exponentially distributed scrubbing, where a memory word is assumed to be checked in an exponentially distributed time period, and (2) deterministic scrubbing, where a memory word is checked periodically. Reliability and mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) equations are derived and estimated. The results of the scrubbing techniques are compared with those of memory systems without redundancies and with only SEC-DED codes. A major contribution of the analysis is easy-to-use expressions for MTTF of memories. The authors derive reliability functions and mean time to failure of four different memory systems subject to transient errors at exponentially distributed arrival times.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3699745","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of scrubbing recovery-techniques for memory systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of scrubbing recovery-techniques for memory systems","sourcePdf":"00052622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026905S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"141","articleId":"52622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52645,"authors":[{"name":"N.C.

However, these modulations, mostly designed with n-use of 2D signals, are primarily aimed at coding gain only. It is pointed out that utilization of all available signal dimensions, which is limited by the time-bandwidth product, may improve the bandwidth efficiency and simultaneously bring an additional coding gain. Trellis coding with a spectrally efficient 4D signal set based on Q/sup 2/PSK is addressed. Without any expansion of the Q/sup 2/PSK signal set, a simple hand-designed 16-state trellis code provides a coding gain of 6.02 dB. With the same number of states in G. Ungergoeck's (1982) 8-PSK trellis, the gain is 4.1 dB. In low intersymbol interference situations, the bandwidth efficiency of this coded Q/sup 2/PSK is twice that of coded 8-PSK; if both operate at 2 b/s Hz and P/sub b/(E)=10/sup -5/, the coded Q/sup 2/PSK provides a saving of about 4 dB over the coded 8-PSK. Some fully connected trellises with an expanded signal due to 2-use of Q/sup 2/PSK signals are also presented. Two such codes ar rate-7/8 achieve a gain of 5.45 dB with only eight states.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel coding with quadrature-quadrature phase shift-keying (Q/sup 2/PSK) signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.52650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1895/00052650.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"417","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00052650.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.52650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Channel coding with quadrature-quadrature phase shift-keying (Q/sup 2/PSK) signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3689741","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel coding with quadrature-quadrature phase shift-keying (Q/sup 2/PSK) signals","sourcePdf":"00052650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033341S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","articleId":"52650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":52654,"authors":[{"name":"A.

They show that if two of the presently unallocated bytes in the path overhead field of STS-1 are assigned for error-correction coding (ECC), a (6208, 6195) shortened extended Hamming code can be implemented using as few as 660 gates plus a 1-kbyte RAM IC, achieving (O8.6*10/sup -3/ P/sub 2//sup 2/) BER reduction with 139 mu s of signal delay. The authors explain how the existing BIP-8 error-monitoring byte of the STS-1 format could be integrated with the proposed ECC so that a net allocation of only one new STS-1 overhead byte is required for both error monitoring and error correction. The implementation method is such that all path, line, and section overhead functions in SONET can be performed at intermediate sites without requiring ECC decoding. The authors consider application alternatives and describe the forward-error-correction (FEC) circuit design and trial results. System issues are covered, including network delay, effects of error extension on BER, addition of double-error detection, performance monitoring, and options for intelligent network control and management of FEC functions. Codes related to their path-level design that are applicable to a number of other strategies for applying FEC in SONET are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.52658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1895/00052658.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.52658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and characterization of an error-correcting code for the SONET STS-1 tributary","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52658/","displayDocTitle":"Design and characterization of an error-correcting code for the SONET STS-1 tributary","volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3689745","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and characterization of an error-correcting code for the SONET STS-1 tributary","sourcePdf":"00052658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048347S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","articleId":"52658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":52659,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It involves a quadtree mean decomposition of the motion-compensated frame-to-frame difference signal followed by a scalar quantization of the local means. As a fundamental property, the new coding algorithm treats the displacement estimation problem and the quadtree construction problem as a unit. The displacement vector and the related quadtree are jointly optimized in order to minimize the direct frame-to-frame update information rate (in bits), which turns up as a new and more adequate cost function in displacement estimation. This guarantees the highest possible data compression ratio at a given quality threshold. Excellent results have been obtained for coding of color image sequences at a rate of 64 kb/s. The quadtree concept entails a much lower computational complexity compared to the conventional motion-compensated transform coder while achieving a subjective image quality that is as good or better than that of the traditional transform-based counterpart.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree-structured scene adaptive coder","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.52659","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1895/00052659.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.52659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Tree-structured scene adaptive coder","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3700092","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-structured scene adaptive coder","sourcePdf":"00052659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03868S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"99","articleId":"52659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":52660,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Under the assumption of white Gaussian background noise, the authors compare detectors by their worst case bit error rate in a near-far environment with low background noise, where the received energies of the users are unknown to the receiver and are not necessarily similar. Conventional single-user detection in a multiuser channel is not near-far resistant, and the substantially higher performance of the optimum multiuser detector requires exponential complexity in the number of users. The authors explore suboptimal demodulation schemes which exhibit a low order of complexity while not exhibiting the impairment of the conventional single-user detector. It is shown that there exists a linear detector whose bit-error-rate is independent of the energy of the interfering users. It is also shown that the near-far resistance of optimum multiuser detection can be achieved by a linear detector. The optimum linear detector for worst-case energies is found, along with existence conditions, which are always satisfied in the models of practical interest.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.52661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1895/00052661.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.52661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1895","startPage":"496","endPage":"508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-far resistance of multiuser detectors in asynchronous channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-far resistance of multiuser detectors in asynchronous channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3689747","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-far resistance of multiuser detectors in asynchronous channels","sourcePdf":"00052661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080702S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"782","articleId":"52661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52662,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

The resulting detectors process the sufficient statistics by means of a multistage algorithm based on a scheme for annihilating successive multiple-access interference. An efficient real-time implementation of the multistage algorithm with a fixed decoding delay is obtained and shown to require a computational complexity per symbol which is linear in the number of users K. Hence, the multistage detector contrasts with the optimum demodulator, which is based on a dynamic programming algorithm, has a variable decoding delay, and has a software complexity per symbol that is exponential in K. An exact expression is obtained and used to compute the probability of error is obtained for the two-stage detector, showing that the two-stage receiver is particularly well suited for near-far situations, approaching performance of single-user communications as the interfering signals become stronger. The near-far problem is therefore alleviated. Significant performance gains over the conventional receiver are obtained even for relatively high-bandwidth-efficiency situations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1895/00052662.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.52662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.52662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage detection in asynchronous code-division multiple-access communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Demodulation","Decoding","Delay","Multiuser detection","Statistics","Multiple access interference","Computational complexity","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","demodulation","probability","real-time systems","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability","spread spectrum systems","asynchronous code-division multiple-access communications","multiuser detection strategy","coherent demodulation","multistage algorithm","real-time implementation","fixed decoding delay","computational complexity","multistage detector","two-stage receiver","near-far situations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multistage detection in asynchronous code-division multiple-access communications","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3689748","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistage detection in asynchronous code-division multiple-access communications","sourcePdf":"00052662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038269S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1015","articleId":"52662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52667,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

The authors propose a transmitter/receiver pair that compensates for crosstalk by treating an entire bundle of twisted pairs as a single multi-input/multi-output channel with a (slowly varying) matrix transfer function. The proposed transceiver uses multichannel adaptive FIR filters to cancel near- and far-end crosstalk, and to pre- and postprocess the input/output of the channel. Linear pre- and postprocessors that minimize mean squared error between the received and transmitted signal in the presence of both near- and far-end crosstalk are derived. The performance of an adaptive near-end crosstalk canceller using the stochastic gradient (least-mean-square) transversal algorithm is illustrated by numerical simulation. Plots of mean squared error versus time and eye diagrams are presented, assuming a standard transmission line model for the channel. A signal design algorithm that maps a vector input bit stream to a stream of channel symbol vectors is also presented and illustrated explicitly for s simple model of two coupled channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.52667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1895/00052667.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.52667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel signal processing for data communications in the presence of crosstalk","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52667/","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel signal processing for data communications in the presence of crosstalk","volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3700095","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel signal processing for data communications in the presence of crosstalk","sourcePdf":"00052667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03803S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","articleId":"52667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52675,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.

The converter is rated and controlled to operate in all four quadrants (discharge, charge, leading VAr, or lagging VAr) at the full 10 MVA rating. It is capable of independent rapid control of real and reactive power with a transient response of 16 ms to changes in commanded value of real or reactive power.

Computer simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.52685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.52685","startPage":"137","endPage":"142","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/1896/00052685.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1896","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00052685.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flux tracking in induction machines by means of volt-ampere quantities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Flux tracking in induction machines by means of volt-ampere quantities","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3689731","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52685/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flux tracking in induction machines by means of volt-ampere quantities","sourcePdf":"00052685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029675S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1990","isNumber":"1896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"1","articleId":"52685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":52686,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Rather than adding inductance in each inverter leg to control fault currents, the design lets the primary leakage inductance of the motor stator windings perform the fault current control function. Appropriate separation of the windings in the stator slots increases the protection afforded. A 4 kW, two-pole, squirrel-cage induction motor, together with a 5 kW MOSFET inverter drive switching at 20 kHz, illustrates that excellent motor performance is possible with the new winding configurations. The motor power rating and torque/slip curves obtained at various speed settings with the new drive are close to those of a motor using standard stator windings. The protection afforded by the windings is shown to increase with the motor power and voltage rating.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3689732","displayDocTitle":"A split-wound induction motor design to improve the reliability of PWM inverter drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A split-wound induction motor design to improve the reliability of PWM inverter drives","sourcePdf":"00052686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025727S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1990","isNumber":"1896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"31","articleId":"52686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":52687,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Examples comparing the first two theoretical moments to simulation results are presented.

The FAR algorithm is derived using a single generic updating formula for orthogonal matrices, which is introduced and derived.

This class of filters, which includes all rank order filters, stack filters, and digital morphological filters, is the set of all filters possessing the threshold decomposition architecture and a consistency property called the stacking property.

An algorithm is provided for determining a generalized stack filter which minimizes the mean absolute error (MAE) between the output of the filter and a desired input signal, given noisy observations of that signal. The algorithm is a linear program whose complexity depends on the window width of the filter and the number of threshold levels observed by each of the filters in the superposition architecture.

A novel topology for constructing stable interpolative modulators of arbitrary order is described. Analysis of this topology shows that with proper design of the modulator coefficients, stability is not a limitation to higher order modulators. Furthermore, complete control over placement of the poles and zeros of the quantization noise response allows treatment of the modulation process as a high-pass filter for quantization noise. Higher order modulators are shown not only to greatly reduce oversampling requirements for high-resolution conversion applications, but also to randomize the quantization noise, avoiding the need for dithering. An experimental fourth-order modulator breadboard demonstrates stability and feasibility, achieving a 90-dB dynamic range over the 20-kHz audio bandwidth with a sampling rate of 2.1 MHz. A generalized simulation software package has been developed to mimic time-domain behavior for oversampling modulators. Circuit design specifications for integrated circuit implementation can be deduced from analysis of simulated data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","volume":"37","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3689801","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A higher order topology for interpolative modulators for oversampling A/D converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A higher order topology for interpolative modulators for oversampling A/D converters","sourcePdf":"00052724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064442S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"242","articleId":"52724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":52726,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

In SC circuits, the shape of the output voltage waveform of an op amp is of no consequence provided that the output settles to within a specified tolerance of its steady-state value prior to the next sampling instant. This feature allows for an optimum op amp frequency shaping to obtain a minimum small-signal settling time. The theory applies to any op amp that is well approximated by a two-pole model, including the conventional two-stage and single-stage folded-cascode topologies. As the commonly used equivalent-circuit Miller-effect model for frequency compensation has generally been improperly applied to two-stage transconductance amplifiers, it does not provide sufficient accuracy to achieve the optimum phase margin condition. Therefore, the use of equivalent-circuit models has been refined to provide greater accuracy and to eliminate some previous misconceptions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.52726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.52726","startPage":"326","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1898/00052726.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Considerations for fast settling operational amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Considerations for fast settling operational amplifiers","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3689803","publicationDate":"March 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considerations for fast settling operational amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00052726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033883S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"92","articleId":"52726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":52727,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.L.

The configuration of a transmission network is that of a loop while the configuration of a distributed network is radial. It is well recognized that the number of load flow solutions for transmission networks, if they exist, are multiple. In contrast, it is shown here that a load flow solution with feasible voltage magnitude for radial distribution networks always exists and is unique.

A general approach to the synthesis of resonant DC/DC converters is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.52739","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1898/00052739.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.52739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"436","endPage":"444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class-E zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching rectifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Class-E zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching rectifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52739/","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3689816","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class-E zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching rectifiers","sourcePdf":"00052739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03127S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"67","articleId":"52739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":52741,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

A special technique for preparing cross-sectional TEM specimens that involves embedding the sample in epoxy, dimpling, and electropolishing is described. The materials systems examined were Al wire bonded to Al foil, and Al wire bonded to Al foil onto which copper or gold was evaporated. Examination of the bond interface in the TEM revealed that in some areas the surface oxides and contaminants were dispersed, allowing the bare metals to contact, whereas in nearby areas the bond interface was filled with debris. The debris could be oxides, surface contaminants, or sheared metal particles. It also appears that the debris is dispersed to low-lying regions between asperities. In studies of the Al/Au/Al and Al/Cu/Al interfaces, microchemical analysis showed no evidence for diffusion or melting along the interface. Therefore, it is concluded that ultrasonic wire bonding does not involve significant heating along the bonding interface. However, it is shown that dynamic annealing of aluminum wire can occur during bonding. The experimental results are compared with previously proposed theories on the mechanism of bonding in ultrasonic welding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/1905/00052867.pdf","doi":"10.1109/33.52867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.52867","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transmission electron microscopy study of ultrasonic wire bonding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52867/","displayDocTitle":"A transmission electron microscopy study of ultrasonic wire bonding","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3689937","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transmission electron microscopy study of ultrasonic wire bonding","sourcePdf":"00052867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07227S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"49","articleId":"52867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52944,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is a hierarchical RAM containing a 1-Mb DRAM for the main memory and an 8-kb SRAM (static RAM) for cache memory. It uses a 1.2- mu m CMOS technology. Suitable for no-wait-state memory access in low-end workstations and personal computers, the chip also serves high-end systems as a secondary cache scheme. It is shown how the cache DRAM bridges the gap in speed between high-performance microprocessor units and existing DRAMs. The cache DRAM concept is explained, and its architecture is presented. The error checking and correction scheme used to improve the cache DRAM's reliability is described.

A variable-structure control technique is utilized to achieve robust (parameter-insensitive) characteristics. The speed and acceleration signals required for the implementation of the variable-structure speed control (VSSC) are dynamically estimated with state observers. Two kinds of observers-the Luenberger full-order observer and an adaptive observer-are explored. The results obtained illustrate that Luenberger observers do not estimate the system states accurately when the system parameters vary. This inaccuracy in the state estimation results in a deterioration of the VSSC performance. Therefore, the possibility of using an adaptive state observer (ASO) is investigated. It is shown that the ASO estimates the system parameters and the system states simultaneously, thus making VSSC possible. The design methods and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the potential of the scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.52961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/1910/00052961.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.52961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of a Luenberger observer and adaptive observer-based variable structure speed control system using a self-controlled synchronous motor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=52961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/52961/","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of a Luenberger observer and adaptive observer-based variable structure speed control system using a self-controlled synchronous motor","volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3679586","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of a Luenberger observer and adaptive observer-based variable structure speed control system using a self-controlled synchronous motor","sourcePdf":"00052961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024858S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","articleId":"52961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":52962,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Zero-voltage switching (with low dv/dt) of the transistor and zero-current switching (with low di/dt) of the rectifier diode reduce switching losses in both stages of the converters, making them especially suitable for high-frequency operation. Because of the high loaded quality factor of the resonant circuit, the range of frequency required for output-voltage regulation is as narrow as 5.46% for load resistances from a full load of 100 Omega to an open circuit. The full-load overall efficiency is 80.36% at 1 MHz. The converters can also operate at a fixed frequency if synchronous rectifiers are applied. The reduction of class-E/sup 2/ converters to lower order converters is presented. Many multiresonant converter topologies are created in this way.

The method is based on a model that incorporates the physical effects of photon statistics, nonuniform photon attenuation, and a camera-dependent point-spread response function. Reconstructions from simulation experiments are presented which illustrate the ability of the ML algorithm to correct for attenuation and point-spread. Standard filtered backprojection method reconstructions, using experimental and simulated data, are included for reference. Three studies were designed to focus on the effects of noise and point-spread, on the effect of nonuniform attenuation, and on the combined effects of all three. The last study uses a chest phantom and simulates Tl-201 imaging of the myocardium.

A real-time channel is defined as a simplex connection between a source and a destination characterized by parameters representing the performance requirements of the client. A study is made of the feasibility of providing real-time services on a packet-switched store-and-forward wide-area network with general topology. A description is given of a scheme for the establishment of channels with deterministic or statistical delay bounds, and the results of the simulation experiments run to evaluate it are presented. The results are judged encouraging: the approach satisfies the guarantees even in worst case situations, uses the network's resources to a fair extent, and efficiently handles channels with a variety of offered load and burstiness characteristics. Also, the packet transmission overhead is quite low, and the channel establishment overhead is small enough to be acceptable in most practical cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.53013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.53013","endPage":"379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1913/00053013.pdf","startPage":"368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scheme for real-time channel establishment in wide-area networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53013/","displayDocTitle":"A scheme for real-time channel establishment in wide-area networks","volume":"8","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3679953","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scheme for real-time channel establishment in wide-area networks","sourcePdf":"00053013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051982S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"731","articleId":"53013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":53015,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The architecture presented attempts to integrate these communications protocols with the DCS in a smooth fashion in order to ease the writing of multimedia applications. Two issues are identified as being essential to the success of this integration: the synchronization of related real-time data streams, and the management of heterogeneous multimedia hardware. The synchronization problem is tackled by defining explicit synchronization properties at the presentation level and by providing control and synchronization operations within the DCS which operate in terms of these properties. The heterogeneity problems are addressed by separating the data transport semantics (protocols themselves) from the control semantics (protocol interfaces).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.53015","startPage":"391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1913/00053015.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.53015","endPage":"400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture for real-time multimedia communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53015/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for real-time multimedia communication systems","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3679955","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for real-time multimedia communication systems","sourcePdf":"00053015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045813S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"176","articleId":"53015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":53016,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This method obtains the optimal estimate of the power system frequency deviation from noisy voltage samples and the best estimate of the mean system frequency deviation and its rate of change while accounting for low-frequency synchronizing oscillations which occur during large disturbances. The proposed technique is a two-stage algorithm which uses an adaptive extended Kalman filter in series with an adaptive linear Kalman filter. The extended Kalman filter calculates the frequency deviation, magnitude, and phase angle of the voltage phasor, which may change during the time period covered by the estimation window. Both the measurement noise variance and the system noise covariance associated with the voltage samples are calculated online. The instantaneous frequency deviation is used as the input to a linear Kalman filter, which models the frequency deviation as a random walk plus a random ramp process. The estimated average rate of frequency decay is represented by the slope of the random ramp.

The expression is arrived at by performing an analysis of apparent resistivity in a multilayer structure as an extension of studies that have concentrated on the two-layer model. Applying a series of parameter data to this expression enabled the preparation of rho -a curves for such a multilayer structure, and these curves were compared with actual rho -a curves obtained from two case studies. The results showed good agreement, indicating that the proposed expression and parameter estimation technique could be practically applied to ground design problems. In particular, earth parameters for a multilayer structure obtained through the proposed method can be used for calculating the ground resistance required by deep-driven rods in a particular geologic formation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.53062","startPage":"604","endPage":"612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/1916/00053062.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.53062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of apparent resistivity in a multi-layer earth structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Earth","Parameter estimation","Equations","Electrodes","Performance analysis","Information analysis","Structural rods","Electric resistance","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earth electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["apparent resistivity","multi-layer earth structure","Wenner four-electrode method","multilayer structure","parameter estimation","ground resistance","deep-driven rods","geologic formation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of apparent resistivity in a multi-layer earth structure","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3691333","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of apparent resistivity in a multi-layer earth structure","sourcePdf":"00053062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034819S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"80","articleId":"53062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":53065,"authors":[{"name":"H.-D.

The effects of peak gate currents (10-100 A) on the anode current di/dt, switching delay, and energy loss in both types of devices are presented. The performance of the devices without the amplifying gate was far superior than that of the devices with the amplifying gate. A model is presented to explain this difference. Thyristors without the amplifying gate successfully switched anode currents on the order of 12.6 kA, at a di/dt of 100000 A/ mu s, from an anode voltage of 2 kV on a single-shot basis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Anodes","Pulse measurements","Electronic equipment testing","Pulse power systems","Delay effects","Voltage","Laser radar","Pulse modulation","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","semiconductor switches","thyristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-short switching measurements","turn-on process","involute structure thyristors","switching characteristics","amplifying gate","peak gate currents","anode current","switching delay","energy loss","anode voltage","10 to 100 A","12.6 kA","2 kV"]}],"doi":"10.1109/63.53149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/1917/00053149.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.53149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Role of the amplifying gate in the turn-on process of involute structure thyristors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Role of the amplifying gate in the turn-on process of involute structure thyristors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53149/","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3691391","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Role of the amplifying gate in the turn-on process of involute structure thyristors","sourcePdf":"00053149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037019S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"14","articleId":"53149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":53150,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The most suitable current phase control method for the rotor geometry was examined by computer simulation and experimentation. It was found that in the i/sub d/=0 control method, high-performance torque control can be obtained as the torque is proportional to the armature current. In the cos phi =1 control method, the torque per armature current is small and the torque characteristic is nonlinear. Therefore, high-performance torque control cannot be expected.

Depending on chip size, the more accurate models are the Poisson and the negative binomial. Several models for line yields in wafer fabrication are also covered. For predicting yields of larger-die-area very large-scale integration, the negative binomial model is the more accurate, but its use many require experimental determination of alpha, sometimes called the cluster parameter, versus chip area for the particular process and factory environment of interest. How an Insystems holographic wafer inspection machine can aid this process is described.

Based on this, the authors derive a simple analytical expression, valid for DFB as well as Fabry-Perot lasers, for the critical feedback level at which coherence collapse sets in.

It is shown that with the lumped gain, the soliton pulse can propagate over more than 9000 km when the repeater spacing is 31 km and fiber loss is 0.22 dB/km.<<ETX>>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical solitons","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Propagation losses","Optical fibers","Optical fiber losses","Optical propagation","Repeaters","Pulse amplifiers","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibres","optical losses","solitons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long distance optical soliton transmission","lumped amplifiers","preemphasis method","lumped-gain soliton transmission system","initial soliton pulse width","fiber loss","repeater spacing","9000 km","31 km","0.22 dB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.53386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/1926/00053386.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.53386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-distance optical soliton transmission with lumped amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Long-distance optical soliton transmission with lumped amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53386/","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3711477","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-distance optical soliton transmission with lumped amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00053386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034548S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"48","articleId":"53386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":53394,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Iterative algorithms allow for the incorporation of various types of prior knowledge about the class of feasible solutions, can be used to remove nonstationary blurs, and are fairly robust with respect to errors in the approximation of the blurring operator. Special attention is given to the problem of convergence of the algorithms, and classical solutions such as inverse filters, Wiener filters, and constrained least-squares filters are shown to be limiting solutions of variations of the iterations. Regularization is introduced as a means for preventing the excessive noise magnification that is typically associated with ill-conditioned inverse problems such as the deblurring problem, and it is shown that noise effects can be minimized by terminating the algorithms after a finite number of iterations.

An examination is made of the DS-CDMA and SCPC Ku-band VSAT satellite systems for low-density (64-kb/s or less) communications. A method for improving the standard link analysis of DS-CDMA satellite-switched networks by including certain losses is developed.

The authors consider the case in which the number of sensors is large, and they derive (asymptotically) optimal rules for determining the messages of the sensors when the observations are generated from a simple and symmetrical set of discrete distributions. They also consider the tradeoff between the number of sensors and the communication rate of each sensor when there is a constraint on the total communication rate from the sensors to the fusion center. The results suggest that it is preferable to have several independent sensors transmitting low-rate (coarse) information instead of a few sensors transmitting high-rate (very detailed) information. They also suggest that an M-ary hypothesis testing problem can be viewed as a collection of M(M-1)/2 binary hypothesis testing problems. From this point of view the most useful messages (decision rules) are those that provide information to the fusion center that is relevant to the largest possible numbers of these binary hypothesis testing problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/1929/00053441.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"292","doi":"10.1109/7.53441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.53441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explicit solutions for some simple decentralized detection problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Explicit solutions for some simple decentralized detection problems","publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3711200","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explicit solutions for some simple decentralized detection problems","sourcePdf":"00053441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06036S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"25","articleId":"53441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":53442,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

With the availability of fully polarimetric SAR data, it is possible to use the three complex elements (HH, HV, VV) of the polarimetric scattering matrix to reduce speckle. The optimal method for combining the elements of the scattering matrix to minimize image speckle is derived, and the solution is shown to be a polarimetric whitening filter (PWF). A simulation of spatially correlated, K-distributed, fully polarimetric clutter is then used to compare the PWF with other, suboptimal speckle-reduction methods. Target detection performance of the PWF, span, and single-channel mod HH mod /sup 2/ detectors is compared with that of the optimal polarimetric detector (OPD). A novel, constant-false-alarm-rate (CFAR) detector (the adaptive PWF) is as a simple alternative to the OPD for detecting targets in clutter. This algorithm estimates the polarization covariance of the clutter, uses the covariance to construct the minimum-speckle image, and then tests for the presence of a target. An exact theoretical analysis of the adaptive PWF is presented; the algorithm is shown to have detection performance comparable with that of the OPD.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3711201","volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal speckle reduction in polarimetric SAR imagery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal speckle reduction in polarimetric SAR imagery","sourcePdf":"00053442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085516S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"226","articleId":"53442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":53450,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The system converts raw DC voltage from photovoltaic cells or three-phase, low-frequency AC voltage from a solar dynamic generator into a regulated, 20-G kHz AC voltage for distribution among various loads. Operations of the components of the system such as driver inverter, DC receiver, bidirectional receiver, and three-phase AC receiver are discussed. EASY5 computer modeling and simulations were performed to study the local and global performance of the system. Simulation results show that the system has fast response and good transient behavior. The AC bus voltage is effectively regulated using the phase-control scheme, which is demonstrated with both line and load variations. The feasibility of paralleling the outputs of driver modules is illustrated with the driver modules synchronized and sharing a common feedback loop. A high-frequency, sinusoidal AC voltage is generated in the three-phase, AC input case, when the driver modules are phased 120 degrees away from one another and their outputs are connected in series.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","volume":"26","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3724157","publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-frequency AC power distribution in Space Station","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-frequency AC power distribution in Space Station","sourcePdf":"00053457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043754S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"25","articleId":"53457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":53462,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For the latter, no approximation is made to the distance function, so that the full range of geometric aberrations is analytically considered, enabling an effective reference filter to be designed. The two-dimensional FFTs were designed as to run on computers of very limited memory: the required FFT is computed by means of FFTs of lower order. Two FFT codes were considered: one is faster and allows full or reduced (quick look or multilook) resolution performance to be obtained easily; the second is slower but allows the use of a space-varying filter and/or investigations on limited portions (zoom) of the image. Both codes are suited to parallel processing, e.g. by a transputer net.

The basic idea of the analysis is to determine the current distribution on the dipole which interacts with the metal fence in the unit cell, so that the active impedance of the element can be computed. This was accomplished by using the moment method and imposing the boundary conditions on the tangential electric fields along the dipole and the metal fence. Since the scan performance in the H-plane is not affected by the fences, the discussion is concentrated on the E-plane behavior. It was found that for a given element spacing and dipole geometry there is an optimum fence height at which the E-plane performance can be most improved. For a typical dipole array geometry the optimum fence height is about 0.4 lambda . It was thought that when the fences are to high and the beam is scanned too far from broadside, transverse magnetic (TM) surface waves propagating in the E-plane direction near the corrugated plane would be excited. However, no such sensitive cases were encountered in the study.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.53496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1931/00053496.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.53496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1931","startPage":"683","endPage":"692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of metal fences on the scan performance of an infinite dipole array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of metal fences on the scan performance of an infinite dipole array","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3710778","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of metal fences on the scan performance of an infinite dipole array","sourcePdf":"00053496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03069S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","articleId":"53496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":53497,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The second approach establishes a duality between the problem of H/sub infinity /-filtering and the problem of unconstrained input H/sub infinity /-optimal regulation. Using this duality, previously published results for the latter regulation problem are applied which lead to an optimal filter that possess the structure of the corresponding Kalman filter. The two approaches usually lead to different results.

It is shown that for any plant with no zeros on the unit circle, the l/sup 1/-optimal design is continuous as a map from the plant to the optimal closed-loop solution if the plant has a unique optimal solution. In the case of nonuniqueness, a superoptimal criterion is proposed that will always lead to a unique solution; however, it still fails to supply continuity. A characterization of a general class of adaptive controllers in the presence of bounded disturbances is given.

First, a variety of conditions is presented. Meeting these conditions guarantees an upper bound on the size of the test set for the ILA under consideration. Second, techniques for designing optimally testable ILAs are presented. The arrays treated are, in some cases, more general than those that have been reported by other researchers: they include multidimensional and inhomogeneous arrays. Octagonally connected arrays and bilateral arrays are also discussed. The results indicate that the characteristics of the individual cell functions (e.g. whether they are bijective) are a good guide to the test complexity of the overall array. Matrix multiplication, as an example, is shown to have several different optimally testable implementations. The results are useful for combinational and pipelined arrays and for certain systolic arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.53577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1934/00053577.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"652","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00053577.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.53577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Easily testable iterative logic arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53577/","displayDocTitle":"Easily testable iterative logic arrays","volume":"39","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711137","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Easily testable iterative logic arrays","sourcePdf":"00053577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036305S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"58","articleId":"53577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":53587,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These circuits are useful building blocks for a real-time fuzzy controller and a fuzzy computer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy multiple-input maximum and minimum circuits in current mode and their analyses using bounded-difference equations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.53598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1935/00053598.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"774","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00053598.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.53598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy multiple-input maximum and minimum circuits in current mode and their analyses using bounded-difference equations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3711146","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy multiple-input maximum and minimum circuits in current mode and their analyses using bounded-difference equations","sourcePdf":"00053598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05089S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"1935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"68","articleId":"53598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":53600,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

The signal constellation consists of all lattice points within a region R, and the shape of this region determines the average signal power. Spherical signal constellations minimize average signal power, and in the limit as N to infinity , the shape gain of the N-sphere over the N-cube approaches pi e/6 approximately=1.53 dB. A nonequiprobable signaling scheme is described that approaches this full asymptotic shape gain in any fixed dimension. A signal constellation, Omega is partitioned into T subconstellations Omega /sub 0/, . . ., Omega /sub tau -1/ of equal size by scaling a basic region R. Signal points in the same subconstellation are used equiprobably, and a shaping code selects the subconstellation Omega /sub i/ with frequency f/sub i/. Shaping codes make it possible to achieve any desired fractional bit rate. The schemes presented are compared with equiprobable signaling schemes based on Voronoi regions of multidimensional lattices. For comparable shape gain and constellation expansion ratio, the peak to average power ratio of the schemes presented is superior. Furthermore, a simple table lookup is all that is required to address points in the constellations. It is also shown that it is possible to integrate coding and nonequiprobable signaling within a common multilevel framework.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.53734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.53734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1940/00053734.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonequiprobable signaling on the Gaussian channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Nonequiprobable signaling on the Gaussian channel","volume":"36","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3710884","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53734/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonequiprobable signaling on the Gaussian channel","sourcePdf":"00053734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032773S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"1940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"142","articleId":"53734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":53735,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The technique, vector coding, uses a set of transmit filters or 'vectors' to partition the channel into an independent set of parallel intersymbol interference (ISI)-free channels for any given finite (or infinite) block length. The optimal transmit vectors for such channel partitioning are shown to be the eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrix for the specified block length, and the gains of the individual channels are the eigenvalues. An optimal bit allocation and energy distribution, are derived for the set of parallel channels, under an accurate extension of the continuous approximation for power in optimal multidimensional signal sets for constellations with unequal signal spacing in different dimensions. Examples are presented that demonstrate performance advantages with respect to zero-forcing decision feedback methods that use the same coset code on the same partial response channel. Only resampling the channel at an optimal rate and assuming no errors in the feedback path will bring the performance of the decision feedback methods up to the level of the vector coded system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.53735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1940/00053735.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.53735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector coding for partial response channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53735/","displayDocTitle":"Vector coding for partial response channels","volume":"36","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3710885","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector coding for partial response channels","sourcePdf":"00053735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04701S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"1940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"146","articleId":"53735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":53736,"authors":[{"name":"M.-P.

An algorithm based on simulated annealing is developed for assigning binary codewords to the vector quantizer code-vectors. It is shown that this algorithm could result in dramatic performance improvements as compared to randomly selected codewords. A modification of the simulated annealing algorithm for binary codeword assignment is developed for the case where the bits in the codeword are subjected to unequal error probabilities (resulting from unequal levels of error protection). An algorithm for the design of an optimal vector quantizer for a noisy channel is briefly discussed, and its robustness under channel mismatch conditions is studied. Numerical results for a stationary first-order Gauss-Markov source and a binary symmetric channel are provided. It is concluded that the channel-optimized vector quantizer design algorithm, if used carefully, can result in a fairly robust system with no additional delay. The case in which the communication channel is nonstationary (as in mobile radio channels) is studied, and some preliminary ideas for quantizer design are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of vector quantization for noisy channels","doi":"10.1109/18.53739","startPage":"799","endPage":"809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.53739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1940/00053739.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"A study of vector quantization for noisy channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3710888","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of vector quantization for noisy channels","sourcePdf":"00053739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157019S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"1940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"361","articleId":"53739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":53744,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A complex baseband channel and correct past decisions are assumed. The dispersive channel may have infinite impulse response, and the noise may be colored. Consideration is given to optimal realizable (stable and finite-lag smoothing) forward and feedback filters in discrete time. They are parameterized as recursive filters. In the special case of transmission channels with finite impulse response and autoregressive noise, the minimum MSE can be attained with transversal feedback and forward filters. In general, the forward part should include a noise-whitening filter (the inverse noise model). The finite realizations of the filters are calculated using a polynomial equation approach to the linear quadratic optimization problem. The equalizer is optimized essentially by solving a system of linear equations Ax=B, where A contains transfer function coefficients from the channel and noise model. No calculation of correlations is required with this method. A simple expression for the minimal MSE is presented. The DFE is compared to MSE-optimal linear recursive equalizers. Expressions for the equalizer in the limiting case of infinite smoothing lags are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.53744","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00053744.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"848","endPage":"858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.53744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1940","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1940/00053744.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Colored noise","Finite impulse response filter","Transversal filters","IIR filters","Smoothing methods","Equations","Baseband","Dispersion","Inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","equalisers","filtering and prediction theory","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transversal filters","decision feedback equalizers","IIR channels","colored noise","mean-square error","complex baseband channel","correct past decisions","dispersive channel","infinite impulse response","finite-lag smoothing","feedback filters","discrete time","recursive filters","transmission channels","finite impulse response","autoregressive noise","minimum MSE","forward filters","polynomial equation approach","linear quadratic optimization","DFE","infinite smoothing lags"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The structure and design of realizable decision feedback equalizers for IIR channels with colored noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53744/","volume":"36","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3724058","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2005","publicationDate":"July 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The structure and design of realizable decision feedback equalizers for IIR channels with colored noise","sourcePdf":"00053744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036027S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"1940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","articleId":"53744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":53745,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

Given any (n, k) linear block code over F with minimum distance d, it is possible to derive an (n, k) code with symbols over F/sup r/, also with minimum distance d, which can correct any pattern of d-2 or fewer symbol errors for which the symbol errors as vectors are linearly independent. This is about twice the bound on the number of errors guaranteed to be correctable. Furthermore, if the error vectors are linearly dependent and d-2 or fewer in number, the existence of dependence can always be detected. A decoding techinque is described for which complexity increases no greater than as n/sup 3/, for any choice of code. For the two applications considered, situations are described where the probability of the error patterns being linearly dependent decreases exponentially with r.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.53757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"911","endPage":"917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1940/00053757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.53757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general decoding technique applicable to replicated file disagreement location and concatenated code decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Concatenated codes","Vectors","Error correction codes","Error correction","Equations","Block codes","Polynomials","Military computing","Contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding technique","replicated file disagreement location","concatenated code decoding","linear block code","minimum distance","(n, k) code","symbol errors","error vectors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"A general decoding technique applicable to replicated file disagreement location and concatenated code decoding","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3710901","publicationDate":"July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/53757/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general decoding technique applicable to replicated file disagreement location and concatenated code decoding","sourcePdf":"00053757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069505S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"1940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"50","articleId":"53757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":53760,"authors":[{"name":"Mao-Chao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mao-Chao Lin","id":"37366138800"},{"name":"Chi-Chang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Chang Lin","id":"38165598900"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"lastName":"Shu Lin","id":"37276533700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"53760","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Computer errors","Linear code","Vectors","Upper bound","Gas insulated transmission lines","Councils","Decoding","Hamming weight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","telecommunications computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer search","unequal error protection","binary cyclic codes","odd length","upper bounds"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=53760","abstract":"Exhaustive computation by a computer was used to find the unequal error protection capabilities of all binary cyclic codes of odd length up to 65 that have minimum distances of at least 3.

To this end, the fundamental role played by adjacent and cochannel interference must be considered. The computer program implemented allows general analysis of continuous phase modulation (CPM) systems with limiter-discriminator detection and symbol-by-symbol regeneration, the combined effects of intersymbol interference, noise, and adjacent channel or cochannel interference have been tested to give the design criteria of the transmission system. To emphasize the role played by interference, an ideal multipath-free channel has been considered: with reference to a binary case, Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) systems have been investigated and compared with full-response CPM systems to obtain a suitable tradeoff between spectral efficiency (connected to channel spacing at radio frequency) and signal-to-noise ratio with fixed bit-error probability. The numerical results presented emphasize the performance obtainable with full- and partial-response techniques for varying system parameters such as phase deviation index, receiver filter bandwidth, and spectral efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","publicationDate":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3711503","volume":"39","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the spectral efficiency of CPM systems over real channel in the presence of adjacent channel and cochannel interference: a comparison between partial and full response systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the spectral efficiency of CPM systems over real channel in the presence of adjacent channel and cochannel interference: a comparison between partial and full response systems","sourcePdf":"00054225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05023S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","articleId":"54225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54226,"authors":[{"name":"J.-F.

In additive white Gaussian noise channels, two-bit DFE achieves the best BER performance, whereas MLSE is the best for cochannel interference-limited channels. BKER performance was also examined. The three-level eye decision is a bit-by-bit decision, and thus has superior performance because there is no error propagation. In fading environments, however, this superiority tends to diminish because bursty errors due to deep fades predominate rather than error propagation effects.

The MEG characteristics of a mobile antenna are determined by the mutual relation between the antenna patterns and the statistical distribution of incident waves in an environment. To analyze this relation theoretically, a general expression for the MEG using a statistical model of incident waves is derived, and a novel statistical model, whose distribution is uniform in azimuth and Gaussian in elevation, is proposed. The validity of the statistical model is confirmed through 900-MHz-band measurements carried out in a Tokyo urban area, and the empirical parameters for the statistical distribution are described. The MEG characteristics of a half-wavelength dipole antenna are investigated using the proposed method, and it is shown that the theoretical curves calculated using the empirical parameters are in excellent agreement with experimental results. This analysis is extremely applicable for evaluating the MEG characteristics of arbitrary mobile antennas in various mobile communication environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711506","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Analysis for mean effective gain of mobile antennas in land mobile radio environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis for mean effective gain of mobile antennas in land mobile radio environments","sourcePdf":"00054228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048961S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"417","articleId":"54228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":54229,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The measurements have focused on acquiring worst-case profiles for typical operating locations. The data reveal that at over 98% of the measured locations, root mean square (RMS) delay spreads are less than 12 mu s. Urban areas typically have RMS delay spreads on the order of 2-3 mu s and continuous multipath power out to excess delays of 5 mu s. In hilly residential areas and in open areas within a city, RMS delay spreads are slightly larger, typically having values of 5-7 mu s. In very rare instances, reflections from city skylines and mountains can cause RMS delay spreads in excess of 20 mu s. The worst-case profiles show resolvable diffuse multipath components at excess delays of 100 mu s and amplitudes 18 dB below that of the first arriving signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00054229.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/1947/00054229.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.54229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.54229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"900-MHz multipath propagation measurements for US digital cellular radiotelephone","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power measurement","Cities and towns","Root mean square","Telephony","UHF measurements","Multipath channels","Propagation delay","Land mobile radio","Urban areas","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","digital radio systems","fading","radiotelephony","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF","USA","urban areas","radiowave propagation","fading","multipath propagation measurements","digital cellular radiotelephone","power delay profile measurements","mobile radio channels","RMS delay spreads","hilly residential areas","open areas","city skylines","mountains","resolvable diffuse multipath components","900 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"900-MHz multipath propagation measurements for US digital cellular radiotelephone","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711507","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"900-MHz multipath propagation measurements for US digital cellular radiotelephone","sourcePdf":"00054229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039057S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"119","articleId":"54229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":54232,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-L.

A converter circuit for a four-phase reluctance motor that uses only four switches is described. Unlike previous circuits with one switch per phase, the switches are created at the motor voltage. Each switch is connected to two of the four phase windings. The switching signals must be carefully derived so that independent control of the phase currents is maintained despite the common connections. Analysis is given to predict the ideal switching algorithm for the converter circuit. This produces the optimum torque at all speeds and currents. Experimental results are given for the performance of the proposed converter circuit as compared with that of other circuits with one switch per phase. It can be seen that for a given supply voltage and peak phase current, the novel converter circuit produces superior torque output from the motor. The low number of switches in the coinverter together with the performance of the four-phase reluctance motor will result in an ideal low-cost variable-speed drive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1990","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 1990","accessionNumber":"3724359","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A unipolar converter for a switched reluctance motor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unipolar converter for a switched reluctance motor","sourcePdf":"00054246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036027S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1990","isNumber":"1948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"25","articleId":"54246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":54247,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The orientation is generally achieved via instantaneous control of stator current relative to either the measured flux or the indirectly estimated flux terms. In either case, the instantaneous control of current is critical. A novel approach for current regulation is presented, based on the use of a nonlinear discrete-time delta modulator which offers the potential for reduced parameter sensitivity and more accurate command tracking than either classical or state-space linear system controllers. A power electronic topology, the resonant DC link is ideally suited to implement this controller. Experimental data on a field-oriented induction machine controller using a resonant DC link inverter topology demonstrate the command tracking performance of this induction-machine current regulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.54256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/1948/00054256.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"301","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00054256.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.54256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic analysis and experimental evaluation of delta modulators for field-oriented AC machine current regulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54256/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic analysis and experimental evaluation of delta modulators for field-oriented AC machine current regulators","volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 1990","accessionNumber":"3724362","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic analysis and experimental evaluation of delta modulators for field-oriented AC machine current regulators","sourcePdf":"00054256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066853S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1990","isNumber":"1948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"43","articleId":"54256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":54257,"authors":[{"name":"P.N.

Several programmed PWM switching patterns to eliminate harmonics in the output spectra of single-phase and three-phase inverters are possible. Each of these leads to a specific advantage in single- and three-phase inverters, depending on the application. First, the superiority of programmed PWM techniques over the conventional carrier-modulated PWMs is established. Next, a critical evaluation of the programmed PWM schemes on the basis of applications for single- and three-phase inverters is used to provide a framework and guidelines for the selection of the appropriate technique for each application area. Evaluation criteria include harmonic loss factor and total harmonic distortion factors defined at the input and output of the inverter terminals. Finally, a simple low-cost solution for obtaining the required PWM switching points is proposed. Selected results are verified experimentally.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.54257","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00054257.png","startPage":"302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/1948/00054257.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.54257","endPage":"316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmed PWM techniques to eliminate harmonics: a critical evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Programmed PWM techniques to eliminate harmonics: a critical evaluation","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3711652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmed PWM techniques to eliminate harmonics: a critical evaluation","sourcePdf":"00054257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05157S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1990","isNumber":"1948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"429","articleId":"54257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":54292,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These views are represented by three graphical languages, the most intricate of which is the language of statecharts, used to depict reactive behavior over time. In addition to the use of statecharts, the main novelty of STATEMATE is in the fact that it understands the entire descriptions perfectly, to the point of being able to analyze them for crucial dynamic properties, to carry out rigorous executions and simulations of the described system, and to create running code automatically.

Working independently, each of 24 programmers first prepared a set of self checks using just the requirements specification of an aerospace application, and then each added self checks to an existing implementation of that specification. The modified programs were executed to measure the error-detection performance of the checks and to compare this with error detection using simple voting among multiple versions. The analysis of the checks revealed that there are great differences in the ability of individual programmers to design effective checks. It was found that some checks that might have been effective failed to detect an error because they were badly placed, and there were numerous instances of checks signaling nonexistent errors. In general, specification-based checks alone were not as effective as specification-based checks combined with code-based checks. Self checks made it possible to identify faults that had not been detected previously by voting 28 versions of the program over a million randomly generated inputs. This appeared to result from the fact that the self checks could examine the internal state of the executing program, whereas voting examines only final results of computations. If internal states had to be identical in N-version voting systems, then there would be no reason to write multiple versions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.54295","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00054295.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/1950/00054295.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.54295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of self checks and voting in software error detection: an empirical study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54295/","displayDocTitle":"The use of self checks and voting in software error detection: an empirical study","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3700196","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of self checks and voting in software error detection: an empirical study","sourcePdf":"00054295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050446S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"79","articleId":"54295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54299,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This transform is equivalent to the maximum noise fraction transform and is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in each successive transform component, just as the principal component transform maximizes the data variance in successive components. Application of this transform requires knowledge or an estimate of the noise covariance matrix of the data. The effectiveness of this transform for noise removal is demonstrated in both the spatial and spectral domains.

Calibration for relative amplitude, relative phase, absolute amplitude, and system crosstalk is addressed. The crosstalk calibration method is based on the theoretical result that for natural targets with azimuthal symmetry the copolarized and crosspolarized components of the scattering matrix are uncorrelated, and the method does not require any external calibration targets to be deployed before imaging. Because compressed data are used, one is forced to model the transmitting and receiving systems as reciprocal. Even though the inferred transmit and receive matrices are not each simply related to the physical transmitter and receiver, the true Stokes matrix for each pixel in an image can be accurately determined by this approach. The method is illustrated by estimating the crosstalk parameters of the NASA/JPL aircraft for different types of terrain and for two frequencies. For the C-band system, the crosstalk is less than -20 dB for all ranges in the images. The crosstalk of the L-band system is a function of range, however, and may be as poor as -10 dB in the near range, leading to a noticeable distortion of the polarization signatures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.54360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1954","startPage":"337","endPage":"348","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/1954/00054360.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calibration of polarimetric radar images using only image parameters and trihedral corner reflector responses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Calibration of polarimetric radar images using only image parameters and trihedral corner reflector responses","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711886","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calibration of polarimetric radar images using only image parameters and trihedral corner reflector responses","sourcePdf":"00054360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040216S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"287","articleId":"54360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":54363,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

Results from airborne SAR overflights of corner reflectors and active radar calibrators are used to demonstrate the validity and consistency of the method and to show that the method is robust under defocus caused by an incorrect FM rate or inadequate motion compensation of data collected during turbulence. It is also shown that the fading errors associated with the integral method are comparable to or slightly worse than those associated with the peak estimation method. However, this small disadvantage is outweighed by the fact that the integral method is independent of actual resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3711889","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic aperture radar calibration using reference reflectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic aperture radar calibration using reference reflectors","sourcePdf":"00054363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029817S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"124","articleId":"54363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":54364,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

The correction does not significantly increase the computation time or complexity of the Born approximation. Thus, it has application to the related inverse problem where the speed of computation of the forward problem is important.

The broadcast capability is defined as the maximum number of simultaneous distinct messages that can be transmitted to distant receivers from a single transmitter at a given bit-error rate. The quantity provides a useful measure of the capacity of hub-to-mobile or satellite-to-earth-station links of communication networks. When bursty data or voice traffic is dominant in such networks, the above forms of spread-spectrum CDMA provide a viable alternative to FDMA or TDMA. Ways of multiplexing the direct-sequence and hybrid signals are presented that use, respectively, distinct carriers, distinct pairs of orthogonal carriers, and only two orthogonal carriers for broadcasting the different messages. Systems with chip-synchronous signals and systems with random delays between the signals are considered.

As a result, for a given total interference power, the performance is worse for the case of one strong interferer when compared to the case of many weak interferers where the Gaussian assumption on the multiple-access interference holds. The author assumes a random-spreading code model and shows that if there is an offset on the carrier and spreading code frequencies of the interfering signals relative to the signal of interest, the above difference in performance between the cases of a set of balanced and a set of unbalanced interferers is drastically reduced. The result is that subject to such frequency offsets one may make the Gaussian assumption on the interference power regardless of whether it is composed of one strong interferer or many weak interferers of the same total power. In a network it may be desirable to actually force the offsets by putting a slight offset on the clock oscillators of the various transmitters. It is shown that to achieve a small variation of the noise variance, the spreading code and carrier offset frequencies should be greater than the symbol rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1961/00054455.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.54455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.54455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1961","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of clock and carrier frequency offsets on the performance of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Frequency","Interference","Spread spectrum communication","Gaussian noise","Radio transmitters","Oscillators","Working environment noise","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier communication","code division multiple access","digital radio systems","probability","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct sequence SSMA systems","balanced interferers","clock oscillator offsets","CDMA","BPSK","BPSK system","ground radio networking environment","carrier frequency offsets","spread-spectrum multiple-access","probability","symbol error","spreading code chip phases","total interference power","Gaussian assumption","random-spreading code model","unbalanced interferers","noise variance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"The effect of clock and carrier frequency offsets on the performance of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access system","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3709464","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of clock and carrier frequency offsets on the performance of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access system","sourcePdf":"00054455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097335S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"13","articleId":"54455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54459,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

Rate n/n+1, trellis codes using 2/sup n+1/-point MPSK signal constellations are investigated when Gold sequences are used for PN spreading. Performance in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is investigated, with 5-20 users transmitting simultaneously. Using the criteria of equal complexity and throughput, the performance of the trellis codes in a SSMA (spread spectrum multiple access) environment is compared to that of medium-rate to low-rate convolutional codes through the use of a generalized transfer function bound. The average degradation due to the interuser interference is determined by the method of moments. The validity of approximating the interuser interference as a Gaussian random variable is also investigated. The numerical results illustrate that for a given complexity, chip rate and throughput, low-rate convolutional codes provide the best performance in an SSMA system. As lower-rate convolutional codes are used, there is an increase in the effective interuser interference due to the greater cross-correlation effects from using shorter PN sequences, or alternatively from the effects of partial cross-correlation. However, this increased degradation is more than overcome by the increased distance properties of the low-rate codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.54459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.54459","endPage":"640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1961/00054459.pdf","startPage":"628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of trellis coded versus convolutionally coded spread-spectrum multiple-access systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54459/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of trellis coded versus convolutionally coded spread-spectrum multiple-access systems","volume":"8","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3709468","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of trellis coded versus convolutionally coded spread-spectrum multiple-access systems","sourcePdf":"00054459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052107S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"62","articleId":"54459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54460,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Essentially, two transmitters were built: one had voice capability, whereas the other transmitted only binary data. Gold codes were used for the spreading sequence. The PN synchronization used a serial search technique for acquisition, and a tau-dither loop for tracking. A squaring loop and a differential encoding scheme (for carrier phase ambiguity) was used in the demodulation process, which was followed by conversion to a voice output when desired. The system was found to perform quite well under both single and multiple-access conditions. As a demonstration of the feasibility of implementing the system on chips, a few small blocks were put on ICs using CMOS technology. These performed as expected, and clearly demonstrated both the feasibility and attractiveness of a VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Spread spectrum communication","Hardware","System testing","Transmitters","Gold","Tracking loops","Encoding","Demodulation","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","code division multiple access","digital radio systems","radio receivers","radio transmitters","spread spectrum communication","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSMA","IC realizations","direct-sequence","spread-spectrum multiple-access","transmitters","voice capability","binary data","Gold codes","spreading sequence","PN synchronization","serial search technique","acquisition","tau-dither loop","tracking","squaring loop","differential encoding scheme","demodulation process","CMOS technology","VLSI implementation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.54462","startPage":"663","endPage":"674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1961/00054462.pdf","doi":"10.1109/49.54462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS SSMA with some IC realizations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"DS SSMA with some IC realizations","accessionNumber":"3709471","publicationDate":"May 1990","volume":"8","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS SSMA with some IC realizations","sourcePdf":"00054462.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025602S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","articleId":"54462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":54463,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The general structure of these detectors consists of a bank of matched filters, a linear transformation that operates on the matched-filter outputs, and a set of threshold devices. The linear transformations are chosen to minimize either a mean-squared-error or a weighted-squared-error performance criterion. Each detector can be implemented using a tapped delay line. The number of computations performed per detected bit is linear in K in each case, and the resulting detectors are thus much simpler than the optimum detector. Under typical operating conditions, these detectors will perform much better than the conventional receiver and often nearly as well as the optimum detector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.54464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1961/00054464.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.54464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1961","startPage":"683","endPage":"690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A family of suboptimum detectors for coherent multiuser communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A family of suboptimum detectors for coherent multiuser communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54464/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3709473","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of suboptimum detectors for coherent multiuser communications","sourcePdf":"00054464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047582S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"575","articleId":"54464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":54465,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In order to implement a local area network (LAN) by using a power line installed in a building wall as a transmission channel, the authors have investigated utilization of DS-SSMA which has advantages such as robustness against narrow-band interference and noise and realization of asynchronous code division multiple access. In a power line, however, restriction of transmission bandwidth for communications makes it difficult to suppress cochannel interference and the channel is also time-varying due to fluctuation of loads. Since the proposed canceller adaptively eliminates cochannel interference as well as intersymbol interference, it can facilitate synchronization and increase the number of the simultaneously accessing users on a power line with restricted processing gain. The error probability in the output of the canceller is theoretically calculated for the steady-state case by using a Markov model. Computer simulations illustrate stable convergence properties of the canceller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.54465","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"691","endPage":"699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1961/00054465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.54465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive canceller of cochannel interference for spread-spectrum multiple-access communication networks in a power line","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Interchannel interference","Spread spectrum communication","Local area networks","Noise robustness","Narrowband","Noise cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","code division multiple access","digital communication systems","error statistics","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","local area networks","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct sequence SSMA system","BER","building wall embedded line","bit error rate","asynchronous CDMA","adaptive canceller","cochannel interference","spread-spectrum multiple-access","communication networks","power line","channel distortion","cross-correlation","pseudonoise sequences","DS-SSMA","local area network","LAN","code division multiple access","intersymbol interference","synchronization","error probability","steady-state case","Markov model","stable convergence properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive canceller of cochannel interference for spread-spectrum multiple-access communication networks in a power line","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3709474","publicationDate":"May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54465/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive canceller of cochannel interference for spread-spectrum multiple-access communication networks in a power line","sourcePdf":"00054465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039418S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"102","articleId":"54465","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":54470,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

The calculations show that the increase in the lateral pressure at the cladding-coating interface adequately reflects the experimentally observed increase in the added transmission losses at low temperatures. The measurements were carried out on loose fibers in a test chamber, where mechanical effects other than the thermally induced shrinkage of the coating were excluded. It is suggested that the thermally induced lateral pressure be used as a tentative criterion of the low temperature threshold of the expected added optical losses in single-coated fibers. The increase in this pressure reflects the increase in the axial thermal loading as well. Single-coated optical fibers can be successfully used in transmission media operated at moderately low temperatures (for instance, in undersea systems) which do not cause large thermally induced forces; otherwise, a dual-coated fiber design should be considered. The final selection of the most feasible coating design must be based on all the material, optical, chemical, technological, mechanical, environmental, and cost considerations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.54502","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00054502.png","startPage":"863","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1963/00054502.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.54502","endPage":"868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanical approach to the evaluation of the low temperature threshold of added transmission losses in single-coated optical fibers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Mechanical approach to the evaluation of the low temperature threshold of added transmission losses in single-coated optical fibers","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3709992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical approach to the evaluation of the low temperature threshold of added transmission losses in single-coated optical fibers","sourcePdf":"00054502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106619S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"1963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"63","articleId":"54502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":54509,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A unified view is offered in which both linguistic decoding and acoustic matching are integrated into a single, optimal network search framework. Advances in recognition architectures are discussed. The fundamentals of Viterbi beam search, the dominant search algorithm used today in speed recognition, are presented. Approaches to estimating the probabilities associated with an HMM model are examined. The HMM-supervised training paradigm is examined.

The number of additional fill-ins in the partitioned inverses of L and U can be made zero. The number of partitions is related to the path length of sparse vector methods. Allowing some fill-in in the partitioned inverses of L and U results in fewer partitions. Ordering algorithms most suitable for sparsity preservation in the inverses of L and U require addition fill-in in L and U themselves. Tests on practical power system matrices with from 118 to 1993 nodes indicate that the proposed approach is competitive in serial environments, and appears more suitable for parallel environments. Because sparse vectors are not required, the approach works not only for short-circuit calculations but also for power flow and stability computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/1965/00054552.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.54552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.54552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partitioned sparse A/sup -1/ methods (power systems)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Sparse matrices","Equations","Topology","Parallel processing","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","matrix algebra","power systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse vector matrices partitioning","power system","short-circuit calculations","power flow","stability computations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1990","displayDocTitle":"Partitioned sparse A/sup -1/ methods (power systems)","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3713530","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioned sparse A/sup -1/ methods (power systems)","sourcePdf":"00054552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03323S","chronDate":"May  1990","isNumber":"1965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"55","articleId":"54552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":54553,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

Partitioning reduces the buildup of nonzero elements in the inverse factors, and parallel computation reduces the number of serial steps in the multiplications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.54554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/1965/00054554.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.54554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse matrix inverse factors (power systems)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54554/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse matrix inverse factors (power systems)","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3713532","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse matrix inverse factors (power systems)","sourcePdf":"00054554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027907S","chronDate":"May  1990","isNumber":"1965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"65","articleId":"54554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":54639,"authors":[{"name":"Rangqing Xu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Rangqing Xu","id":"37087496248"},{"name":"Zhidao Cao","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhidao Cao","id":"37087495465"},{"name":"Yangtan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yangtan Liu","id":"37087496000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"54639","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Image reconstruction","Frequency","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Sampling methods","Inverse synthetic aperture radar","Signal generators","Wideband","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","Doppler effect","estimation theory","interpolation","radar theory","random noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISAR","noise effect","motion compensation","inverse synthetic aperture radar","interpolation","cross correlation","estimation","cross-range image","Doppler ambiguities","range profiles","motion compensation","simulation","reconstructed image"]}],"abstract":"A method of motion compensation for inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) is proposed.

Teleautomation goes beyond autonomous control in that it blends in human intelligence and action as appropriate. It goes beyond teleoperation in that it incorporates as much autonomy as is possible or reasonable. A novel approach for solving one of the fundamental problems facing teleautonomous systems is discussed in detail: the need to overcome time delays due to telemetry and signal propagation. Concepts called time and position clutches are introduced; these allow the time and position frames, respectively, between the local user control and the remote device being controlled to be desynchronized. The design and implementation of these mechanisms lead to substantial telemanipulation performance improvements, including the novel result of improvements even in the absence of time delays. The controls also yield a simple protocol for handoffs of the control of manipulation tasks between local operators and remote systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.54731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.54731","endPage":"158","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00054731.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/1975/00054731.pdf","startPage":"146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teleautonomous systems: projecting and coordinating intelligent action at a distance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54731/","displayDocTitle":"Teleautonomous systems: projecting and coordinating intelligent action at a distance","volume":"6","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3703584","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teleautonomous systems: projecting and coordinating intelligent action at a distance","sourcePdf":"00054731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088041S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"131","articleId":"54731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":54733,"authors":[{"name":"F.-T.

In this method, the general solution of the linear equality constraints is obtained by transforming the underspecified matrix into row-reduced echelon form; then, the linear equality constraints of the force distribution problem are eliminated. In addition, the duality theory of linear programming is applied. The resulting method is applicable to a wide range of systems, constraints, and objective functions and yet is computationally efficient. The significance of this method is demonstrated by solving the force distribution problem of a grasping system under development at Ohio State called DIGITS. With two fingers grasping an object and hard point contact with friction considered, the CPU time on a VAX-11/785 computer is only 1.47 ms. If four fingers are considered and a linear programming package in the IMSL library is utilized, the CPU time is then less than 45 ms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.54733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/1975/00054733.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"187","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00054733.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.54733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient algorithm for optimal force distribution-the compact-dual LP method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54733/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient algorithm for optimal force distribution-the compact-dual LP method","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3703586","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient algorithm for optimal force distribution-the compact-dual LP method","sourcePdf":"00054733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031309S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"163","articleId":"54733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":54734,"authors":[{"name":"L.S.

Such a representation forms the basis for efficient planning algorithms that make possible an increase in assembly system flexibility by allowing an intelligent robot to pick a course of action according to instantaneous conditions. The AND/OR graph is equivalent to a state transition graph but requires fewer nodes and simplifies the search for feasible plans. Three applications are discussed: the preselection of the best assembly plan, the recovery from execution errors, and the opportunistic scheduling of tasks. A hypothetical error situation in the assembly of the four-part assembly is discussed to show how a bottom-up search of the AND/OR graph leads to an efficient recovery. The scheduling efficiency using this representation is compared with fixed sequence and precedence graph representations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3703587","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"AND/OR graph representation of assembly plans","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AND/OR graph representation of assembly plans","sourcePdf":"00054734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040314S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"434","articleId":"54734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":54805,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

The performance of simultaneous convolution operators when there are sources of additive noise prior to the inverse is addressed. The main point is that for noise typical of electrooptical sensors, invertible multiple operators with their inverses will always outperform any set of single or multiple operators with the inverse omitted.

Such systems find applications in radar, sonar, and ultrasound imaging, as well as in applications such as seismology and radio astronomy. For linear imaging techniques related to beamforming and based on the Fourier transform relationship between the source distribution and the aperture plane measurements, the point spread function of the system completely characterizes its performance. This function is determined by the geometry of the physical aperture or array as well as the weighting that can be applied to measurements. It is shown that the introduction of the concept of coarray, both for receive apertures in incoherent imaging and for transmit/receive systems in reflection-mode coherent imaging, provides a convenient and elegant framework within which many apparently isolated techniques for point-spread function or aperture synthesis can be understood. In addition to this unifying role, coarray concept gives new insight into the aperture synthesis process, which allows interesting new imaging techniques to be developed, especially in coherent imaging.","doi":"10.1109/5.54811","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/1977/00054811.pdf","startPage":"735","endPage":"752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.54811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The unifying role of the coarray in aperture synthesis for coherent and incoherent imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","displayDocTitle":"The unifying role of the coarray in aperture synthesis for coherent and incoherent imaging","volume":"78","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3716172","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The unifying role of the coarray in aperture synthesis for coherent and incoherent imaging","sourcePdf":"00054811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047189S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"304","articleId":"54811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":54812,"authors":[{"name":"B.G.

The approach has the capability to extract communication signals from cochannel interference environments using only known spectral correlation properties of those signals, i.e. without using knowledge of the content or direction of arrival of the transmitted signal, or the array manifold or background noise covariance of the receiver, to train the antenna array. The class of spectral self-coherence restoral (SCORE) objective functions is introduced, and algorithms for adapting antenna arrays to optimize these objective functions are developed. Using the theory of spectral correlation, it is shown by analysis and simulation that these algorithms maximize the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at the output of the narrowband antenna array when a single communication signal with spectral self-coherence at a known value of frequency separation, along with an arbitrary number of interferers without spectral self-coherence at that frequency separation, are impinging on the array.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3716173","volume":"78","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectral self-coherence restoral: a new approach to blind adaptive signal extraction using antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral self-coherence restoral: a new approach to blind adaptive signal extraction using antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00054812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077017S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"149","articleId":"54812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":54818,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Design methods based on limitations due to the combined spatial and temporal characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) are developed. The concepts of resolution imbalance, recognizability, and spatial-temporal multiplexing are explained. The design and analysis of two-channel NTSC-compatible HDTV systems having an aspect ratio of 16:9 with double the vertical and horizontal resolution of the present NTSC system is described. It is shown that such a system requires more than two channels for transmission. Signal processing techniques are suggested to improve the quality of the images without using any extra channels. Time multiplexing of different frequency bands are used to exploit the psychovisual redundancies of the HVS to reduce the number of pels to be transmitted. Finally, comparing the spatial resolutions of the reconstructed images by a two-channel HDTV system with that of the HVS, it is found that the spatial resolution are not yet as good as that of the HVS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.54823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/1978/00054823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.54823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1978","startPage":"175","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of two-channel high definition television systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of two-channel high definition television systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3710797","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of two-channel high definition television systems","sourcePdf":"00054823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049182S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"1978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","articleId":"54823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":54835,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This online test consists of detecting illegal paths in the control flow graph. These illegal paths may be due either to permanent faults or to transient errors. The state code flow is compacted through polynomial division. An implicit justifying signature method is applied at the state code level and ensures identical signatures before each join mode of the control flow graph. The signatures are then independent of the path followed previously in the graph, and the comparison to reference data is greatly facilitated. This property is obtained by a state assignment, nearly without area overhead.

Encoding schemes are given for some of the example codes which fall under the general set of real-number codes. With the help of experiments, a rule is derived for the selection of a particular code for a given application.

Experimental data are given to show that the test generation complexity may grow exponentially with the length of the cycles in the circuit. This complexity grows only linearly with the sequential depth. Graph-theoretic algorithms are presented to select a minimal set of flip-flops for eliminating cycles and reducing the sequential depth. Tests for the resulting circuit are generated by a sequential logic test generator. An independent control of the scan clock allows insertion of scan sequences within the vector sequence produced by the test generator.

FIAT is capable of emulating a variety of distributed system architectures, and it provides the capabilities to monitor system behavior and inject faults for the purpose of experimental characterization and validation of a system's dependability. The experiments consists of exhaustively injecting three separate fault types into various locations, encompassing both the code and data portions of memory images, of two distinct applications executed with several different data values and sizes. Fault types are variations of memory bit faults. The results show that there are a limited number of system-level fault manifestations. These manifestations follow a normal distribution for each fault type. Error detection latencies are found to be normally distributed.

A framework, based on algebraic codes, is developed for the analysis and synthesis of MISR-based test response compressors for BIST. This framework is used to develop closed-form expressions for the aliasing probability of MISR for arbitrary test length. An error model, based on q-ary symmetric channel, is proposed using more realistic assumptions. Results are presented that provide the weight distributions for q-ary codes (q=2/sup m/, where the circuit under test has m outputs). These results are used to compute the aliasing probability for the MISR compression technique for arbitrary test lengths. This result is extended to compression using two different MISRs. It is shown that significant improvements can be obtained by using two signature analyzers instead of one. The weight distribution of a class of codes of arbitrary length is also given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54855/","volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3699820","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Aliasing probability for multiple input signature analyzer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aliasing probability for multiple input signature analyzer","sourcePdf":"00054855.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03422S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"1979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"65","articleId":"54855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":54856,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

The limiting factor is taken to be the accuracy with which the receiver can measure the channel output. More precisely, the following problem is considered. Given a channel with known impulse response h(t), a transmitter with an output amplitude constraint, and a receiver that can distinguish between two signals only if they are separated in amplitude at some time t/sub 0/ by at least some small positive constant d, what is the maximum number of messages, N/sub max/, that can be transmitted in a given time interval (0,T)? Lower bounds on N/sub max/ can be easily computed by constructing a particular set of inputs to the channel. The main result is an upper bound on N/sub max/ for arbitrary h(t). The upper bound depends on the spread of h(t), which is the maximum range of values the channel output may take at some time t/sub 0/>0 given that the output takes on a particular value alpha at time t=0. Numerical results are shown for different impulse responses, including two simulated telephone subscriber loop impulse responses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.54875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1981/00054875.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"484","doi":"10.1109/18.54875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounds on maximum throughput for digital communications with finite-precision and amplitude constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on maximum throughput for digital communications with finite-precision and amplitude constraints","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3710863","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on maximum throughput for digital communications with finite-precision and amplitude constraints","sourcePdf":"00054875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029831S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","articleId":"54875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54876,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The attack makes use of an algorithm based on continued fractions that finds the numerator and denominator of a fraction in polynomial time when a close enough estimate of the fraction is known. The public exponent e and the modulus pq can be used to create an estimate of a fraction that involves the secret exponent d. The algorithm based on continued fractions uses this estimate to discover sufficiently short secret exponents. For a typical case where e>pq, GCD(p-1, q-1) is small, and p and q have approximately the same number of bits, this attack will discover secret exponents with up to approximately one-quarter as may bits as the modulus. Ways to combat this attack, ways to improve it, and two open problems are described. This attack poses no threat to the normal case of RSA where the secret exponent is approximately the same size as the modulus. This is because the attack uses information provided by the public exponent and, in the normal case, the public exponent can be chosen almost independently of the modulus.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.54902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1981/00054902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.54902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1981","startPage":"553","endPage":"558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryptanalysis of short RSA secret exponents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cryptanalysis of short RSA secret exponents","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3724047","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryptanalysis of short RSA secret exponents","sourcePdf":"00054902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053955S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"332","articleId":"54902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":54903,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

A sufficient and necessary condition is given for the asymptotic efficiency of the candidate simulation distributions. This is done in the multidimensional setting that is required by many practical simulation problems. The result obtained is applied primarily in two areas. First, the generalization of previous work dealing with functionals of Markov chains is discussed. A second area of application is the simulation of nonlinear systems with Gaussian inputs. As an example of a system with Gaussian inputs, the simulation of a digital communication channel with nonlinear ISI (intersymbol interference) characteristic of satellite data links is considered. In the case of linear ISI, the asymptotically efficient exponentially twisted distribution turns out to agree with a method previously proposed by D. Lu and K. Yao (1988). The large-deviations point of view provides some useful insight on how to extent the Lu and Yao method to nonlinear channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.54903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1981/00054903.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.54903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On large deviations theory and asymptotically efficient Monte Carlo estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"On large deviations theory and asymptotically efficient Monte Carlo estimation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3724048","volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On large deviations theory and asymptotically efficient Monte Carlo estimation","sourcePdf":"00054903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044559S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"177","articleId":"54903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54908,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For band-limited channels of bandwidth B, however, the constant-envelope constraints does reduce the capacity, even if the signals themselves are allowed arbitrarily rapid alternations (transitions). Here, using a recently introduced technique, it is shown that the capacity is further drastically reduced if, in addition to the channel limitation, the constant-envelope signal is itself restricted to a small fractional out-of-band power epsilon . Ideal lowpass and bandpass channel filters are considered, and upper bounds on the capacity are derived. The out-of-band power restrictions can be met, for example, by restricting the average rate of transitions rho of the binary input signal. It is shown that in this case, epsilon <or=0.573 rho /B, which is a result used to upper-bound the capacity for binary signaling under an average-transition-rate constraint.<<ETX>>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3724053","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity penalty due to input-bandwidth restrictions with an application to rate-limited binary signaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity penalty due to input-bandwidth restrictions with an application to rate-limited binary signaling","sourcePdf":"00054908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024913S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","articleId":"54908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":54913,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

In this approach, the nonlinear behavior of large-signal modulated laser diodes and solid-state oscillators is exploited to extend the bandwidth of the synchronizing link to the millimeter-wave frequency range. Experimental results of the phase and frequency coherency of two 21.5 GHz FET oscillators are reported. Optimum performance is achieved at a subharmonic factor of 1/4, with a locking range of 84 MHz and a phase noise degradation of only 14 dB. The phase coherency measurement of two injection-locked oscillators points to a phase shift, which is introduced as a result of the frequency detuning between the slave and master oscillator signals. A scheme to correct for this phase error is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1982/00054913.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"476","doi":"10.1109/22.54913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.54913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical synchronization of millimeter-wave oscillators for distributed architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Optical synchronization of millimeter-wave oscillators for distributed architecture","publicationDate":"May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3710908","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical synchronization of millimeter-wave oscillators for distributed architecture","sourcePdf":"00054913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051429S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"98","articleId":"54913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":54917,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

The design is addressed in terms of reactively matched optical transmitter and receiver modules. Analog and digital characterization of a 50-m fiber-optic link realized using these modules indicates the applicability of this architecture as the only viable alternative for distribution of data signals inside a satellite at present. It is demonstrated that the design of a reactive matching modules enhances the link performance.

A multiple-beam adaptive base-station antenna is proposed as a major system component in an attempt to solve this problem. The approach is demonstrated by employing an antenna array capable of resolving the angular distribution of the mobile users as seen at the base-station site, and then using this information to direct beams toward either lone mobiles, or groupings of mobiles, for both transmit and receive modes of operation. The energy associated with each mobile is thus confined within the addressed volume, greatly reducing the amount of cochannel interference experienced from and by neighboring cochannel cells. To ascertain the benefits of such an antenna, the conventional and proposed antenna systems are modeled in a typical mobile radio environment. For a given performance criterion, the theoretical results indicate that a significant increase in the spectral efficiency, or capacity, of the network is obtainable with the proposed antenna.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54956/","volume":"39","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3689648","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The performance enhancement of multibeam adaptive base-station antennas for cellular land mobile radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance enhancement of multibeam adaptive base-station antennas for cellular land mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"00054956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055068S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"304","articleId":"54956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":54957,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Two methods for calculating metric values for each bit in a received block are considered: the values are calculated from the received signal envelope sample and from the demodulator output. Bit error rate (BER) performances of hard decision and trellis decoding are compared using Hamming (7, 4) and Golay (24, 12) codes in computer simulations and laboratory experiments. A simplified trellis decoding algorithm, in which the hard decision output of a bit with an envelope sample greater than the threshold value is accepted as correct, is presented. Laboratory experimental results for trellis decoding in combination with Gaussian minimum-shift-keying (GMSK) modulation and frequency detection are shown. The effect of n-bit A/D-conversion in signal envelope sampling is investigated experimentally.

The packets of voice and data are integrated through a movable boundary method. The uplink channel access uses a framed-polling protocol whereas the downlink uses a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) scheme. This system dynamically switches between two transmission rates and uses multiple antennas to maximize the throughput in the fading multipath indoor environment. Throughput and delay characteristics of the system are analyzed using four different techniques. The results are compared with those of Monte Carlo computer simulations. A simple relationship between the number of voice terminals and the throughput of the data traffic are derived for an upper bound of 10-ms delay for the data packets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/1983/00054958.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.54958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.54958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated voice/data system for mobile indoor radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data systems","Indoor radio communication","Throughput","Fading","Delay","Radio network","Speech analysis","Access protocols","Downlink","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication systems","digital radio systems","fading","mobile radio systems","packet switching","protocols","time division multiple access","voice communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice packets","wireless communication","multipath fading","integrated voice/data system","mobile indoor radio networks","movable boundary method","uplink channel access","framed-polling protocol","downlink","time-division multiple-access","TDMA","throughput","delay characteristics","data packets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"An integrated voice/data system for mobile indoor radio networks","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3689650","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated voice/data system for mobile indoor radio networks","sourcePdf":"00054958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055192S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","articleId":"54958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":54966,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.-I.

QPSK is concentrated upon to perform simulations for a frequency-selective fading channel. Spectral efficiency improvement due to better frequency reuse for the more sensitive coherent detection is evaluated with a combination of analysis and simulation. It is found that coherent detection with perfect carrier recovery is superior to differential detection by at least 2.4 dB, which converts to about a 30% improvement in spectral efficiency in a two-dimensional, frequency reuse system with a fourth-power propagation exponent. This advantage is preserved even if diversity selection is used to mitigate fading.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1984/00054966.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.54966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.54966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of coherent and differential detection of BPSK and QPSK in a quasistatic fading channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature phase shift keying","Time division multiple access","Filtering","Phase detection","Sensitivity analysis","Frequency-selective fading channels","Analytical models","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","fading","mobile radio systems","phase shift keying","signal detection","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D frequency reuse system","signal detection","mobile rad quasistatic fading channel","coherent detection","differential detection","quadrature phase-shift keying","QPSK","binary phase-shift keying","BPSK","receiver-sensitivity analysis","frequency-selective fading channel","carrier recovery","spectral efficiency","fourth-power propagation exponent","diversity selection","30 percent","2.4 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of coherent and differential detection of BPSK and QPSK in a quasistatic fading channel","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711662","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of coherent and differential detection of BPSK and QPSK in a quasistatic fading channel","sourcePdf":"00054966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036436S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","articleId":"54966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54968,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.

While the sequence of hits is not Markovian, there is an underlying Markovian structure that allows the probability distribution of the number of hits to be calculated in a recursive fashion. Knowing the probability distribution of the number of hits makes it possible to calculate the probability of error for a system employing error correcting codes for several different types of receivers, including receivers with both errors and erasures. The numerical results show that both the approximation obtained by assuming the actual sequence of hits is Markovian and the approximation obtained by assuming the hits are independent are very good. When the number of frequency slots is not too small (less than five), calculations show that assuming the independence of hits gives an error probability accurate to within 1% of the actual error probability.

Low burst rate (LBR) traffic stations will access the ACTS multibeam communications package (MCP) through two hopping beams that can be directed at certain cities and areas in the continental United States. An onboard baseband processor (BBP) demodulates uplink traffic received via two up-link (30 GHz) hopping beams, switches the traffic between uplink and downlink beams at baseband, and then remodulates the traffic for retransmission at 20 GHz via two downlink hopping beams. This study concentrates on the demand assigned operation of the ACTS LBR system where the onboard switch is remote from both the traffic stations and the centralized master control station (MCS). Network control uses inbound and outbound orderwire channels and a BBP control channel thereby allowing the MCS to coordinate assignment of individual 64-kb/s channels in the spacecraft. Models are developed to simulate the dynamics of the demand assignment process in order to verify call blocking behavior, to predict control channel loads, and to evaluate alternative algorithms for burst time plan rearrangement that becomes necessary to minimize blocking under conditions of high-traffic intensity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand assignment in the ACTS LBR system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.54982","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1984/00054982.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.54982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=54982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Demand assignment in the ACTS LBR system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711678","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand assignment in the ACTS LBR system","sourcePdf":"00054982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138848S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"54982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":54983,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The resulting filter transfer functions are particularly suitable for realization as leap-frog lossless discrete integrator (LDI) switched-capacitor structures and also in wave digital form. Due to the specific form of the transfer function, the filters generally have no lumped-element counterparts. The technique leads to an optimum compromise between amplitude selectively and passband phase linearity under the restriction of a prescribed form of the transfer function, and allows the use of finite j omega -axis zeros of transmission for achieving high amplitude selectivity. The transfer functions presented are also capable of realization as distributed microwave filters, but these require the use of coupled-wire networks in the form of distributed Brune sections, if j omega -axis zeros of transmission are introduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/54998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711756","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of switched-capacitor and wave digital filters with linear phase and high amplitude selectivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of switched-capacitor and wave digital filters with linear phase and high amplitude selectivity","sourcePdf":"00054998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052355S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"10","articleId":"54998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":55000,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Unfortunately, the number of computations for this general case is quite high. To reduce the number of computations, two new state-space adaptive filters are introduced. One application where these new structures are shown to be useful is in oversampled filtering where an estimate of the final pole locations is known and the adaptive filter is required only to fine-tune the transfer function. It is shown that for this type of application, the new adaptive structures can have much improved adaptation rates and roundoff noise performance as compared to the corresponding direct-form realizations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.55026","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1986/00055026.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.55026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"673","endPage":"684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive recursive state-space filters using a gradient-based algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive recursive state-space filters using a gradient-based algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55026/","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3735253","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive recursive state-space filters using a gradient-based algorithm","sourcePdf":"00055026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03786S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"1986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"38","articleId":"55026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":55029,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The circuit consists of a diode, a capacitor shunting the diode, and a second-order low-pass output filter. The shunt capacitor shapes the voltage across the diode so that the diode turns on and off at low dv/dt. Therefore, switching losses and switching noise are reduced significantly. An advantage of the rectifier is that the diode junction capacitance is absorbed into the shunt capacitor. The basic equations governing rectifier operation are derived. The following performance parameters are determined: current and voltage waveforms, device stresses, component values, and power-output capability.

The analog circuits can operate in real time, orders of magnitude faster than the digital model, but it is shown that a direct analog implementation may not be as accurate as the original digital network. An analysis is also presented that shows that the inaccuracies arise not only, as expected, directly from the limited numerical precision of the analog circuit but also indirectly from parameter sensitivity, which is shown to be a problem for this type of neural network.

The requirement for high voltage gains and fast settling times in the context of the inherent technological disadvantages of GaAs (MESFET) devices leads to the development of a whole range of novel circuit techniques. For optimum performance, single-stage designs with single-ended input are considered initially. A description is given of a differential-to-single-ended converter stage that can be combined with these high gain stages to yield differential input amplifiers. A new procedure for characterizing amplifiers in terms of settling time is presented. It reveals the ultimate speed limitation for a given amplifier design and allows the MESFET gatewidths to be scaled in order to obtain optimum settling behavior for any given capacitive load. Ideas are pursued for a new generation of amplifiers with very fast settling times approaching 200 ps, intended for future switched-capacitor systems with 1-GHz switching frequencies. Considerable emphasis is placed throughout on the minimization of chip area and power consumption. The application of one of the amplifier designs in an integrated switched capacitor filter chip is presented, along with encouraging preliminary measurement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3711784","volume":"37","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of GaAs operational amplifiers for analog sampled data applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of GaAs operational amplifiers for analog sampled data applications","sourcePdf":"00055067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033554S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"1987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"18","articleId":"55067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":55074,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

A set of rotation-invariant features are introduced. They are the magnitudes of a set of orthogonal complex moments of the image known as Zernike moments. Scale and translation invariance are obtained by first normalizing the image with respect to these parameters using its regular geometrical moments. A systematic reconstruction-based method for deciding the highest-order Zernike moments required in a classification problem is developed. The quality of the reconstructed image is examined through its comparison to the original one. The orthogonality property of the Zernike moments, which simplifies the process of image reconstruction, make the suggest feature selection approach practical. Features of each order can also be weighted according to their contribution to the reconstruction process. The superiority of Zernike moment features over regular moments and moment invariants was experimentally verified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.55109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1989/00055109.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.55109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invariant image recognition by Zernike moments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Invariant image recognition by Zernike moments","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3711840","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invariant image recognition by Zernike moments","sourcePdf":"00055109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044691S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1285","articleId":"55109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55118,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

Results are obtained for the case where the system is linear and noise-free, for the case where noise is added to the system, and for the case where a nonlinear system is controlled. Comparisons are made with respect to closed-loop system stability, speed of adaptation, noise rejection, the number of required calculations, system tracking performance, and the degree of theoretical development.

The integration is patterned after models of human motor skill acquisition. The initial control task chosen to demonstrate the integration technique involves teaching a two-link manipulator how to make a specific type of swing. A three-level task hierarchy is defined consisting of low-level reflexes, reflex modulators, and an execution monitor. The rule-based execution monitor first determines how to make a successful swing using rules alone. It then teaches cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural networks how to accomplish the task by having them observe rule-based task execution. Following initial training, the execution monitor continuously evaluates neural network performance and re-engages swing-maneuver rules whenever changes in the manipulator or its operating environment necessitate retraining of the networks. Simulation results show the interaction between rule-based and network-based system components during various phases of training and supervision.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","publicationDate":"April 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3697372","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrating neural networks and knowledge-based systems for intelligent robotic control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating neural networks and knowledge-based systems for intelligent robotic control","sourcePdf":"00055128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050541S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"90","articleId":"55128","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55130,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

In particular, it is shown how the concepts of self-adaptive control theory can be modified to allow their use in a continuous updating of the spark-angle map as a function of load and speed. Used in this manner, the self-tuner can account for in-service changes in engine characteristics, changes due to variations of ambient and operational conditions. In addition, self-adaptation allows the spark-controller algorithm to tune itself, so that the factory-generated spark map is precisely matched to the exact nature of each individual engine. The basic theory of self-tuning optimizers (also known as extremum controllers) is outlined, and their performance features are discussed with particular reference to their implementation in adaptive spark-timing systems. It is shown that the self-tuning extremum controller can be made robust even when the signal-to-noise ratio is less than one.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/37/1990/00055130.pdf","doi":"10.1109/37.55130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.55130","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-tuning optimization of spark ignition automotive engines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55130/","displayDocTitle":"Self-tuning optimization of spark ignition automotive engines","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3697374","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-tuning optimization of spark ignition automotive engines","sourcePdf":"00055130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064993S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"31","articleId":"55130","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55132,"authors":[{"name":"H.-S.

Since the vehicle model is nonlinear, time varying, and implicit, it is replaced by a set of linear time-invariant models that are valid over certain operation regions. The two inputs to the vehicle are throttle and steering. The two measured output variables are the vehicle's longitudinal speed and heading rate. The quantitative feedback theory (QFT) is used to obtain a robust control system. The control loop for vehicle speed is designed to track the speed command and reject the disturbance caused by steering. The control loop for the vehicle heading rate is designed to track only the rate command, since the disturbance caused by throttle is negligible. The control system is tested by simulation and shows satisfactory results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.55134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/37/1990/00055134.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.55134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of turning control for a tracked vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1990","displayDocTitle":"Design of turning control for a tracked vehicle","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1990","accessionNumber":"3697378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of turning control for a tracked vehicle","sourcePdf":"00055134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046084S","chronDate":"April  1990","isNumber":"1990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"16","articleId":"55134","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55162,"authors":[{"name":"E.Y.Y.

A design procedure is outlined for the sliding-mode speed controller. The methods of decoupling and torque linearization for the SCWRIM are derived using the field-orientation as well as the torque angle control concepts. Sliding-mode control with cascaded integral operation is used to reduce torque chattering and steady-state error. Accelerator sliding lines are introduced to enable better utilization of the torque capability of the drive system. The parameter-insensitive response provided by this method of control is demonstrated. The effects on the dynamic and static performance with varying drive inertia and load disturbance are studied and compared with the conventional approach using PI control. The influences of sampling effects on sliding-mode control performance are also illustrated and discussed. Microcontroller-based implementation of the speed drive system is employed.

The algorithm works on a set of configurations constituting a constant-size population. The transformations are performed through crossover operators that generate a new configuration assimilating the characteristics of a pair of configurations existing in the current population. Mutation and inversion operators are also used to increase the diversity of the population, and to avoid premature convergence at local optima. Due to the simultaneous optimization of a large population of configurations, there is a logical concurrency in the search of the solution space which makes the genetic algorithm an extremely efficient optimizer. Three efficient crossover techniques are compared, and the algorithm parameters are optimized for the cell-placement problem by using a meta-genetic process. The resulting algorithm was tested against TimberWolf 3.3 on five industrial circuits consisting of 100-800 cells. The results indicate that a placement comparable in quality can be obtained in about the same execution time as TimberWolf, but the genetic algorithm needs to explore 20-50 times fewer configurations than does TimberWolf.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.55180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1993","startPage":"500","endPage":"511","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1993/00055180.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.55180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic approach to standard cell placement using meta-genetic parameter optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","Circuit testing","Computational modeling","Simulated annealing","Biological cells","Character generation","Concurrent computing","Very large scale integration","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutation operators","CAD","computer aided design","layout design","standard cell placement","meta-genetic parameter optimization","genetic algorithm","chromosonal representation","physical layout","constant-size population","crossover operators","inversion operators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"A genetic approach to standard cell placement using meta-genetic parameter optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3721472","publicationDate":"May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic approach to standard cell placement using meta-genetic parameter optimization","sourcePdf":"00055180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038141S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"1993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"108","articleId":"55180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":55188,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The technique is particularly appropriate for circuits designed by silicon compilers. Circuit modules and signals are described at a high descriptive level. Test data for modules are described by predefined stimulus/response packages that are processed symbolically using techniques derived from artificial intelligence. The packages contain sequences of stimulus and response vectors which are propagated as units. Since many test vectors are processed simultaneously, a substantial increase in test generation speed can be achieved. A prototype test generator which uses the technique to generate tests for acyclic circuits has been implemented.

The present theory provides a formalism for the analysis of series-parallel graphs and identifies the mathematical structures that underlie the layout problem. It also leads to two efficient algorithms for designing minimum area functional cell layouts. The first algorithm, TrailTrace, accepts an ordering of M that is fixed, typically for performance reasons, and produces the minimum area layout for that ordering. Its time complexity is linear in the number of transistors in the cell. The second algorithm, R-TrailTrace, reorders M and produces the best layout area that can be achieved for any reordering that preserves the cell's functionality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layout optimization of static CMOS functional cells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.55210","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1995/00055210.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.55210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Layout optimization of static CMOS functional cells","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3721478","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout optimization of static CMOS functional cells","sourcePdf":"00055210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076216S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"1995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"55","articleId":"55210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55213,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The construction is accomplished by formally demonstrating the isomorphism which binds this kind of CA to the LFSRs. Consequently, these CAs can be analyzed as linear machines. Linear algebraic techniques are then applied appropriately for the transformations, and a useful search algorithm is developed which, given an irreducible characteristic polynomial, finds a corresponding linear hybrid automaton.

The behavior of a linear hybrid CA and that of its corresponding LFSR are similar-that is, they have the same cycle structure and only relabel the states.

Two different gate currents of opposite polarity were observed. These gate currents are shown to be correlated with device degradation behavior, which is distinctly different in each case. The gate bias thus divides into two stress regions, corresponding to small and large mod V/sub G/ mod . In the former, the parameter shift is initially pronounced but saturates in time. In the latter, the device degradation is initially small but cumulative in time. Therefore, both stress regions are equally important in affecting the device lifetime.

The error analysis via computer simulation includes an evaluation of errors associated with the correlation method. For a uniform flow velocity profile, beamwidth modulation represents the greatest error source. However, for a nonuniform flow velocity profile, the jitter caused by a small flow velocity gradient can exceed the other error sources.

An ultrasonic data acquisition system determined the time shift between a pair of range gated echoes by searching for the time shift with the maximum correlation between the RF sampled waveforms. Experiments with a 5-MHz transducer indicate that the standard deviation of the estimate of steady fluid velocity through 6-mm-diameter tubes is less than 10% of the mean. Experimentally, Sephadex (G-50; 20-80 mu m dia.) particles in water and fresh porcine blood have been used as ultrasound scattering fluids. Two-dimensional (2-D) flow velocity can be estimated by slowly sweeping the ultrasonic beam across the blood vessel phantom. Volumetric flow through the vessel is estimated by integrating the 2-D flow velocity field and then is compared to hydrodynamic flow measurements to assess the overall experimental accuracy of the time-domain method. Flow rates from 50-500 ml/min have been estimated with an accuracy better than 10% under the idealized characteristics used in this study, which include straight circular thin-walled tubes, laminar axially-symmetric steady flow, and no intervening tissues.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.55307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/2000/00055307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.55307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2000","startPage":"176","endPage":"189","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00055307.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volumetric blood flow via time-domain correlation: experimental verification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Volumetric blood flow via time-domain correlation: experimental verification","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3713772","pubMedId":"18285030","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volumetric blood flow via time-domain correlation: experimental verification","sourcePdf":"00055307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032205S","chronDate":"May  1990","isNumber":"2000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"93","articleId":"55307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":55314,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Natural frequencies with related eigenmodes of those devices as well as their responses to various time-dependent mechanical or electrical excitations are computed. The theoretically calculated mode shapes of piezoelectric transducers and their electrical impedances agree quantitatively with interferometric and electric measurements.

However the design of a drive system often necessitates analysis of its dynamic behaviour, to establish that its performance, in terms of its torque-speed characteristic, torque and speed ripple, current spikes etc. will be acceptable. The simulation model described has the flexibility for modelling quite diverse supply conditions, including PWM or current mode, and back-EMF waveforms, as well as alternative control strategies. When coupled with the finite-element analysis of a motor therefore, from which parameters such as the EMF constant and waveform, winding inductances and a cogging torque function can be generated, the model allows the precise steady-state and transient performance to be predicted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00055370.png","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 Fourth International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives Conf.

The NDFWM conversion efficiency from the probe input to the FWM signal output is a maximum of 8.3 dB around zero detuning and has positive gain in the range of +or-6 GHz.

Atmospheric turbulence was simulated by selectively aberrated quartz plates designed to produce a turbulence-like phasefront distortion on a transmitted beacon. A 69-channel wavefront sensor measured the beacon's phasefront and commanded a deformable mirror to impose the conjugate phasefront on the Stokes seed to a high-gain, large-Fresnel-number Raman amplifier. After amplification, the output Stokes beam was made to retrace the path of the beacon back through the simulated turbulence.

Silicon substrates 15 mu m thick*30 mu m wide can easily penetrate guinea pig and rat pia arachnoid layers with minimum dimpling and no breakage, while substrates 30 mu m thick*80 mu m wide can penetrate guinea pig and rat dura mater repeatedly without breakage. Quantitative comparison on the relative toughness of neurophysiological tissues in rat and guinea pig have also been experimentally obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.55638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.55638","endPage":"481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2010/00055638.pdf","startPage":"474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strength characterization of silicon microprobes in neurophysiological tissues","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55638/","displayDocTitle":"Strength characterization of silicon microprobes in neurophysiological tissues","volume":"37","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"3724092","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"2345003","publicationDate":"May 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strength characterization of silicon microprobes in neurophysiological tissues","sourcePdf":"00055638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047759S","chronDate":"May  1990","isNumber":"2010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"125","articleId":"55638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55666,"authors":[{"name":"Y.Z.

This interference reference signal and its quadrature, obtained by software, are linearly combined to be subtracted from any one of the channels to reduce the interference to below the quantization level of the 12 b A/D converter. Coefficients of the linear combination are estimated using linear regression, which is applied to the relatively isoelectric regions of the data, excluding the QRS complexes. Since the interference reference signal is available in real time, simultaneously with the ECG signals, another software approach is adopted in which an adaptive interference reduction algorithm is used to cope with varying interference. A recursive-least-squares algorithm with forgetting factor is used to update the coefficients. This updating mechanism is gated by the output of a software QRS detector. Results regarding the performance of both the offline and the adaptive algorithms are given, and the effects of nonisoelectric portions of the ECG lead signals on the estimation of the coefficients are quantified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1990","volume":"37","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3746454","pubMedId":"2354844","publicationDate":"June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new technique for line interference monitoring and reduction in biopotential amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new technique for line interference monitoring and reduction in biopotential amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00055666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050214S","chronDate":"June  1990","isNumber":"2011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"22","articleId":"55666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":55674,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

Two basic electrode configurations ('snug' cuff monopolar and tripolar longitudinally aligned dots) have been considered. In addition, the feasibility of steering excitation into superficial nerve trunk regions using subthreshold levels of current flow from an electrode dot located on the opposite side of the nerve has been tested. The modeling objectives were to solve for the electric field that would be generated within a representative nerve trunk by each electrode configuration and to use a simple nerve cable model to predict the effectiveness of each configuration in producing localized excitation. In three acute experiments on cat sciatic nerve the objective was to characterize the effectiveness of each electrode configuration in selectively activating only the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Modeling and experimentation both suggest that longitudinally aligned tripolar dot electrodes on the surface of a nerve trunk, and bounded by a layer of insulation (such as a nerve cuff), will restrict excitation to superficial nerve trunk regions more successfully than will monopolar dot electrodes. Excitation steering will improve the spatial selectivity of monopolar and tripolar electrode configurations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2012/00055681.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"715","doi":"10.1109/10.55681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.55681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nerve cuff technique for selective excitation of peripheral nerve trunk regions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1990","displayDocTitle":"A nerve cuff technique for selective excitation of peripheral nerve trunk regions","publicationDate":"July 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3734925","pubMedId":"2394459","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nerve cuff technique for selective excitation of peripheral nerve trunk regions","sourcePdf":"00055681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035721S","chronDate":"July  1990","isNumber":"2012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"144","articleId":"55681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":55682,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

Measurements of PD are made for the CM-II electrode system. Effects of the pressure and gas inside the void on the PD are examined. Taking into account the experimental results, a model for the PD mechanism is proposed. This model assumes that the statistical time lag of discharge depends on the overvoltage and that the residual voltage depends on the PD magnitude. A Monte Carlo simulation of the PD distribution is made on the basis of this model. The computed results agree well with the experimental data and the appearance of swarming pulsive micro discharges. The physics of the model are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/2014/00055716.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/14.55716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.55716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements of partial discharges by computer and analysis of partial discharge distribution by the Monte Carlo method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Partial discharge measurement","Distributed computing","Pulse measurements","Electrodes","Plastic insulation","Degradation","Statistical analysis","Voltage control","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","Monte Carlo methods","organic insulating materials","overvoltage","partial discharges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharges","partial discharge distribution","Monte Carlo method","CIGRE Method II","closed-void model system","computer-aided PD measuring system","pressure","statistical time lag","overvoltage","residual voltage","swarming pulsive micro discharges"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Measurements of partial discharges by computer and analysis of partial discharge distribution by the Monte Carlo method","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3735001","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements of partial discharges by computer and analysis of partial discharge distribution by the Monte Carlo method","sourcePdf":"00055716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031109S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"88","articleId":"55716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55721,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Using a device with L/sub eff/=0.15 mu m and T/sub ox/=7.5 nm, substrate current is measured at a drain bias as low as 0.7 V; gate current is measured at a drain bias as low as 1.75 V. Using the charge-pumping technique, hot-electron degradation is also observed at drain biases as low as 1.8 V. These voltages are believed to be the lowest reported values for which hot-electron currents and degradation have been directly observed. These low-voltage hot-electron phenomena exhibit similar behavior to hot-electron effects present at higher biases and longer channel lengths. No critical voltage for hot-electron effects (such as the Si-SiO/sub 2/ barrier height) is apparent. Established hot-electron degradation concepts and models are shown to be applicable in the low-voltage deep submicrometer regime. Using these established models, the maximum allowable power supply voltage to insure a 10-year device lifetime is determined as a function of channel length (down to 0.15 mu m) and oxide thicknesses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-voltage hot-electron currents and degradation in deep-submicrometer MOSFETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.55752","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2015/00055752.pdf","startPage":"1651","endPage":"1657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.55752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Low-voltage hot-electron currents and degradation in deep-submicrometer MOSFETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3734839","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-voltage hot-electron currents and degradation in deep-submicrometer MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00055752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035256S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"82","articleId":"55752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55757,"authors":[{"name":"D.D.-L.

The contact resistance increases when the current flows out of the emitter and decreases when the current is reversed. The drift in emitter resistance can be thermally accelerated and is consistent with the electromigration phenomenon. The emitter-base junction shows negligible degradation when stressed in normal-mode operation, i.e. the current flows out of the emitter. However, the junction degrades when stressed with open collector or when stressed in inverse mode. The annealing experiments show that the junction degradation results from the interface-state generation. However, the drift in contact resistance cannot be recovered by annealing.

The main conclusions of the paper are: (1) stable resonant tunneling diode operation is difficult to obtain, and (2) the circuit and device conditions required for stable operation greatly reduce the amount of power that can be produced by these devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.55778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2016/00055778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.55778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2016","startPage":"864","endPage":"872","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00055778.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and stability limitations of resonant tunneling diodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power and stability limitations of resonant tunneling diodes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3734862","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and stability limitations of resonant tunneling diodes","sourcePdf":"00055778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046292S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"83","articleId":"55778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":55780,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Equations of the mode voltages and currents of a power amplifier with some failed unit amplifiers are provided. The equations are obtained by taking into account the spurious-mode excitation to the cavity from the unit amplifiers, and are developed by using an analogous expansion by the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT). Equivalent circuits of the power amplifier for the various mode excitations are discussed, and load admittances for the spurious-mode excitations are applied to the equations for calculating the gain of the amplifier. The load admittance is analytically obtained using variational methods for a combiner with coaxial input/output ports. Numerical results for the power amplifier gain when there is a failed unit amplifier are shown. The effects of gain of the capability of suppressing spurious-mode waves using slits in the combiner are clarified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Equations","Power combiners","Voltage","Degradation","Power generation","Microwave FETs","Satellite broadcasting","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cavity resonators","microwave amplifiers","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave power amplifier","combiner/divider","circular cavities","discrete Fourier transformation","mode voltages","failed unit amplifiers","spurious-mode excitation","mode excitations","load admittances","gain","variational methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.55786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2016/00055786.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.55786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a microwave power amplifier using a combiner/divider with circular cavities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a microwave power amplifier using a combiner/divider with circular cavities","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55786/","volume":"38","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3734870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a microwave power amplifier using a combiner/divider with circular cavities","sourcePdf":"00055786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082861S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"8","articleId":"55786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":55863,"authors":[{"name":"W.

To address the first problem, a technique that involves a quadratic estimation of the peak of the profile distribution was developed. This method was compared with the standard technique of Gaussian fitting and was found to be as accurate for constant background distributions. For axial resolution, a second method involving a single scan and imaging of line sources oriented 45 degrees to the axis of the scanner was proposed. Axial FWHM estimations were achieved by deconvolving the values obtained with line spread functions from sources placed parallel to the axis of the scanner. This technique was validated by comparing the results with those obtained by others using a multiple-scan technique on a similar machine.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Radioactive decay","Positron emission tomography","Image reconstruction","Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Testing","Quality control","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","position measurement","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic nuclear medicine","measurement","resolution","sampling","positron emission tomograph","PET","full-width half-maximum","FWHM","full-width tenth-maximum","FWTM","multiple reconstructed data sets","profile distribution","Gaussian fitting","line spread functions","multiple-scan technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/23.55863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/2018/00055863.pdf","startPage":"1506","endPage":"1513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.55863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to the measurement of resolution and sampling on a positron emission tomograph","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to the measurement of resolution and sampling on a positron emission tomograph","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55863/","volume":"37","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3734903","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to the measurement of resolution and sampling on a positron emission tomograph","sourcePdf":"00055863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035803S","chronDate":"Aug.  1990","isNumber":"2018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"4","articleId":"55863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":55865,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

It is found that when AC space charge is included in the analysis of weakly relativistic multicavity gyroklystron amplifiers, the optimized nonlinear efficiency becomes a function of beam current. For a cold beam (no velocity spread), the efficiency is maximum at zero current and decreases monotonically as the current increases. The zero current limit of the optimized efficiency when AC space-charge effects are included is not the same as the optimized efficiency with no space charge; it is significantly higher. This behavior is regularized when velocity spread is taken into account; in that case, the nonlinear efficiency increases with beam current until it reaches a maximum, then falls off slowly. The increase in efficiency is attributed to enhanced bunching associated with the saturation of the space-charge instability in the drift region; the reduction in efficiency at high current occurs because space charge induces an additional velocity spread in the beam.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3735190","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"AC space-charge effects in gyroklystron amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC space-charge effects in gyroklystron amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00055896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035089S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"12","articleId":"55896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":55921,"authors":[{"name":"W.

These amplifiers are driven by an annular intense relativistic electron beam (500-kV, 10-kA range), which is modulated by an external RF source (1.3-GHz, 100-kW range). Experiments, theory, simulation, and simple models are presented to illustrate the unusual properties of such devices which result from the intense space charge of the beam. Chief among them are electrostatic insulation against vacuum breakdown at high power levels, efficient current modulation, short bunching length, and amplitude and phase stability of the output signal. Many of these unexpected features were revealed in two separate experiments: one with a lower current beam (5 kA, 2-cm beam radius), and the other one with a higher current beam (16 kA, 6.6-cm beam radius). Three gigawatts of RF power at 1.3 GHz were generated with the large diameter beam at an efficiency of 35% with 37-dB gain. These experiments are reviewed, along with a combination of particle simulation results and analytic models which facilitate the interpretation. Special attention is paid to the unfamiliar features of these amplifiers, and the critical problems which must be solved before such amplifiers can fulfil their potential in a wide range of applications are addressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Klystrons","Intensity modulation","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Vacuum breakdown","Laboratories","Electron beams","Optical modulation","Space charge","Electrostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["klystrons","relativistic electron beam tubes","space charge"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulated intense relativistic electron beams","Naval Research Laboratory","external RF source","simulation","space charge","electrostatic insulation","vacuum breakdown","current modulation","phase stability","500 kV","100 kW","10 kA","5 kA","1.3 GHz","2 cm","16 kA","37 dB","35 percent","6.6 cm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/27.55927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/2020/00055927.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.55927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relativistic Klystron amplifiers driven by modulated intense relativistic electron beams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=55927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relativistic Klystron amplifiers driven by modulated intense relativistic electron beams","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/55927/","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3735219","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relativistic Klystron amplifiers driven by modulated intense relativistic electron beams","sourcePdf":"00055927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04851S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"57","articleId":"55927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":55928,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

The procedure offers the advantage of not requiring a special test signal or special test conditions. The approach takes advantage of the stator voltage equations which allow robust parameter-insensitive estimation of the electromagnetic torque while operating at nominal speeds for which the stator IR voltage drop is negligible ( approximately=5 Hz and above). This torque computation is independent of the rotor flux field-oriented control. In essence, the approach uses a stator flux controller to detect improper tuning of the feedforward rotor flux controller. The theoretical and practical implementations of such a continuous self-tuning system are presented.

The MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT) is a high-speed power semiconductor with the potential for high voltage and current ratings. Distinctive features of the device are discussed relative to inverter topology, gate drive requirements, and fault protection. Since MCT devices of sufficient rating were not available, insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor (GBT) devices were used in the experimental model. MCT and IGBT devices have comparable switching times. The design of a 7.5 kW and 20 kHz inverter is discussed, including a modified pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching algorithm conducive to microprocessor implementation. The algorithm requires reduced computational and storage requirements over previous PWM methods. Implementation of the algorithm is accomplished by a digital signal processor using the efficient C language.

The circuit D-Q transformation is proposed for the analyses of the AC converters such as inverters, rectifiers, and cycloconverters which include the time-varying transformers.

The estimation technique is based on maximum-likelihood estimation. The measurement model is nonlinear and includes false alarms. The algorithm is first developed for a single target and then extended to multiple targets. For multiple targets, unresolved measurements are also considered to provide a realistic analysis of targets crossing in the measurement space. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived for the target parameter estimation in the presence of false measurement. A detection mechanism that can validate the existence of a target corresponding to the estimated track is formulated. For a single target, it is shown that only the global maximum leads to the acceptance of the target hypothesis. The test for multiple targets is obtained by formulating a multiple-hypotheses problem. The theoretical performance predictions are validated via Monte Carlo simulations. The effect on the performance of the density of false measurements is illustrated in examples. The highest false-measurement density for which this technique works corresponds to SNR=2 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2023/00056019.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.56019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.56019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and estimation for multiple targets with two omnidirectional sensors in the presence of false measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Parameter estimation","Testing","Target tracking","Density measurement","Noise measurement","Background noise","Sonar equipment","Maximum likelihood detection","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter","Monte Carlo methods","parameter estimation","signal detection","sonar","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear measurement model","sonar technique","false alarms","multiple targets","two omnidirectional sensors","false measurements","track-before-detect methodology","target detection","passive sensors","maximum-likelihood estimation","unresolved measurements","Cramer-Rao lower bound","target parameter estimation","Monte Carlo simulations","SNR","2 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Detection and estimation for multiple targets with two omnidirectional sensors in the presence of false measurements","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","accessionNumber":"3735306","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and estimation for multiple targets with two omnidirectional sensors in the presence of false measurements","sourcePdf":"00056019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028182S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"2023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"36","articleId":"56019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":56020,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It therefore provides a means of examining the relative tradeoff between levels of pipelining, chip area, power consumption, and throughput rate within a given VLSI design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.56023","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2023/00056023.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.56023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"787","endPage":"793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The use of data dependence graphs in the design of bit-level systolic arrays","volume":"38","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3735310","publicationDate":"May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of data dependence graphs in the design of bit-level systolic arrays","sourcePdf":"00056023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04364S","chronDate":"May 1990","isNumber":"2023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"30","articleId":"56023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":56027,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is shown that, under certain low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, the HOS-based method performs much better than the conventional energy one.

An efficient algorithm based on the Ellacott-Williams method is proposed to solve the problem. The algorithm separately designs the numerator and denominator, and uses a linear programming method to solve the linear complex approximation problem. For each iteration, it requires only half the computations of the Ellacott-Williams algorithm. The locally best approximation is usually found in five iterations and has an exactly equiripple error. Two ways to establish good initial points are presented. IIR filters are designed which have nearly linear phase in the passbands. Degenerate design can be detected and is shown by an example.

Using the aliasing relationship between the undersamples frames and the reference image, an algorithm based on weighted recursive least-squares theory is developed in the wavenumber domain. This algorithm is efficient because interpolation and noise removal are performed recursively, and is highly suitable for implementation via the massively parallel computational architectures currently available.

The utilized network is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier with one hidden layer. Back-propagation learning is used for its training. Two types of features are used: moment invariants derived from geometrical moments of the image, and features based on Zernlike moments, which are the mapping of the image onto a set of complex orthogonal polynomials. The performance of the MLP is compared to the Bayes, nearest-neighbor, and minimum-mean-distance statistical classifiers. Through extensive experimentation with noiseless as well as noisy binary images of all English characters (26 classes), the following conclusions are reached: (1) the MLP outperforms the other three classifiers, especially when noise is present; (2) the nearest-neighbor classifier performs about the same as the NN for the noiseless case; (3) the NN can do well even with a very small number of training samples; (4) the NN has a good degree of fault tolerance; and (5) the Zernlike-moment-based features possess strong class separability power and are more powerful than moment invariants.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3735296","volume":"38","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Classification of invariant image representations using a neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of invariant image representations using a neural network","sourcePdf":"00056063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038833S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"106","articleId":"56063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":56070,"authors":[{"name":"F.A.

Based on frequency-domain modal analysis, a set of formulas is derived to describe the voltage and current transfer functions of coupled interconnects with arbitrary linear termination impedances and used to obtain analytical expressions for the time-domain waveforms for lossless multiconductors interconnection lines. The weak-coupling assumption is found to be only marginally valid. In a typical interconnection configuration, the secondary coupling of the disturbed line on the original signal line substantial and must be taken into account for accurate prediction of the waveforms. Simulation results are given to illustrate the influence of the layout parameters of the interconnects and the rise or fall times of the source signal. It is shown that ground conductors need to be placed on both sides of each of the signal lines to reduce crosstalk effectively. However, the presence of the ground conductors increases the layout complexity and results in more severe waveform distortion for the signal on the active line.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.56075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.56075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/2025/00056075.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk analysis of interconnection lines and packages in high-speed integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk analysis of interconnection lines and packages in high-speed integrated circuits","volume":"37","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3735273","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk analysis of interconnection lines and packages in high-speed integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00056075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048817S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"68","articleId":"56075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":56079,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The integrated circuit was built using a charge-coupled-device-(CCD)-based architecture. A study of the current efforts to develop NN hardware reveals that the conventional electronic approach suffers from two major problems: (1) a tradeoff between the complexity of the synapse and the number of synapses per chip; and (b) the I/O (input/output) problem, namely, the slow communication between the chip and the surrounding environment. This approach circumvents the problems by using CCD arrays and/or a spatial light modulator as a short-term memory for the device. The preliminary results presented serve to validate the assumptions on which the CCD approach is based and to reassess the potential of this approach. The CCD architecture is based on two main assumptions: (a) the revolving charge packets in the CCD rings can complete several full cycles without substantial decay, (thus the required refresh of the matrix from an external memory will not significantly degrade the overall operation speed) and (b) the multiplication process, namely, the nondestructive sensing of the W/sub ij/ packets revolving in the CCD rings and their accumulation (provided the respective V/sub j/ is on) can be accomplished accurately and quickly. It is now clear that both these assumptions are valid.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge coupled devices","Neural networks","Circuit testing","Integrated circuit modeling","Fabrication","Integrated circuit testing","Analog integrated circuits","Network-on-a-chip","Integrated circuit interconnections","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computer circuits","charge-coupled device circuits","linear integrated circuits","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD neural processor","neural network","programmable analog synapses","spatial light modulator","short-term memory","revolving charge packets","refresh","multiplication process","nondestructive sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56087","doi":"10.1109/31.56087","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/2025/00056087.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00056087.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.56087","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The CCD neural processor: a neural network integrated circuit with 65536 programmable analog synapses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The CCD neural processor: a neural network integrated circuit with 65536 programmable analog synapses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","volume":"37","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3735283","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The CCD neural processor: a neural network integrated circuit with 65536 programmable analog synapses","sourcePdf":"00056087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038679S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"23","articleId":"56087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56157,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

Typical thin-film interconnections (copper lines 8 mu m wide and 4 mu m thick) were analyzed, and a large CMOS driver was used in the simulation. It was found that a pitch of 32 mu m for the microstrip configuration and 20 mu m for the stripline configuration is required to obtain a low-crosstalk environment for an input frequency up to 1 GHz. It is shown that long lines (length between 8 cm and 18 cm) do not need any termination, but short lines (shorter than 8 cm, but longer than the length at which a line is considered to be a lumped circuit) must be terminated with customized termination resistors to obtain optimal package performance. The loading effects n the termination behavior of short and long thin-film microstrips are also discussed. It is shown that high power generation in thin-film lines at a high frequency (1 GHz) would require an advanced cooling technique for the thin-film multichip package.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.56160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/2030/00056160.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"302","doi":"10.1109/33.56160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and design of lossy transmission lines in a thin-film multichip package","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and design of lossy transmission lines in a thin-film multichip package","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3735375","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and design of lossy transmission lines in a thin-film multichip package","sourcePdf":"00056160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035163S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"18","articleId":"56160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":56163,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Interrupted printing tests provided guiding information on the flow pattern in the paste during the deposition process. The paste flow region ahead of the squeegee was divided into three regions: the pressurization region (region I), the downward screen cross-flow region (region II), and the paste accumulation region (region III). During printing, the squeegee tip becomes deformed and its angle of attack decreases. Region I extends from the leading edge of the deformed squeegee tip to the beginning of the deformation region. As a result of pressure buildup in region I ahead of the squeegee, there is a flow of paste under the squeegee. The paste deposition process depends mainly on the flow process in region I. Analysis of experiments indicates that the squeegees used deform so that their fronts can be approximated by a wedge. The angles of hard squeegees decrease by approximately 20 degrees from the undeformed angle of 45 degrees . The corresponding angle decrease for soft squeegees is on the order of 30-40 degrees . The vertical forces acting on the squeegees were estimated to be between 60 and 47 lbf. The average speed of the paste under the squeegee, caused by the developed hydrodynamic pressure, was found to be between 0.1 and 0.2 of the squeegee speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/2030/00056169.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/33.56169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.56169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of the off-contact screen printing process.

The image is described in terms of nested light and dark regions. This algorithm, successfully implemented in one, two, and three dimensions, can theoretically work with any number of dimensions. The interactive postprocessing developed technique selects regions from the descriptive tree for display in several ways: pointing to a branch of the image description tree, specifying by sliders the range of scale and/or intensity of all regions which should be displayed, and pointing (on the original image) to any pixel in the desired region.

Since the possible strings may be acoustically similar, a language model is required; given a word string, the model returns its linguistic probability. Several Markov language models are discussed. A novel kind of language model which reflects short-term patterns of word use by means of a cache component (analogous to cache memory in hardware terminology) is presented. The model also contains a 3g-gram component of the traditional type.

However, the output of the MF and the LMS processes is dependent on the scene energy and marginally dependent on the filter signal shape. An approach referred to as the modified matched filter (MMF) is presented. The MMF is a product of the LMS filter and a nonlinear operator known as the inverse Euclidean distance. The nonlinear operator modifies the LMS filter to improve its sensitivity to signal shape. A comparison indicates the relative merit of including shape detection in the LMS clutter-suppression process. Infrared cloud scenes from the background measurements and analysis program (BMAP) were used to demonstrate the relative clutter-suppression performance for both the LMS and the MMF processes. A performance metric is developed to measure cloud clutter suppression quantitatively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56196/","volume":"12","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3724668","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Modified matched filter for cloud clutter suppression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified matched filter for cloud clutter suppression","sourcePdf":"00056196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04007S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"19","articleId":"56196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":56204,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The model is a joint probability distribution for the array of pixel gray levels and an array of labels. In boundary finding, the labels are binary, zero, or one, representing the absence or presence of boundary elements. In partitioning, the label values are generic: two labels are the same when the corresponding scene locations are considered to belong to the same region. The distribution incorporates a measure of disparity between certain spatial features of block pairs of pixel gray levels, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric measures of difference between the distributions of these features. The number of model parameters is minimized by forbidding label configurations, which are assigned probability zero. The maximum a posteriori estimator of boundary placements and partitionings is examined. The forbidden states introduce constraints into the calculation of these configurations.

The environment considered is a two-dimensional floor plan that is extended into the third dimension, in which the scanning is performed in the horizontal plane.

By considering the physics of sound propagation, the sonar scanning density required to detect these objects is determined. An experimental verification is included. The limitations of detecting objects with sonar in a more general environment are discussed.

Because of the special characteristics of the Chinese language, syllables are chosen as the basic units for dictation. The machine is designed based on a hierarchical language recognition approach in which acoustic signals are first recognized as a sequence of syllables, possible word hypotheses are then formed from the syllables, and the complete sentences are finally obtained. This approach is implemented by two subsystems. The first recognizes the syllables using speech signal processing techniques, the second subsystem then identifies the exact characters from the syllable and corrects the errors in syllable recognition. The detailed syllable recognition algorithms, word formation rules, parser, grammar, and the syntactic checking algorithms are described. With newspaper text in the form of isolated syllables as input, the preliminary test results indicate that such a dictation machine is not only practically attractive, but technically feasible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.56213","startPage":"695","endPage":"704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.56213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2032","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/2032/00056213.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mandarin dictation machine based upon a hierarchical recognition approach and Chinese natural language analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56213/","displayDocTitle":"A Mandarin dictation machine based upon a hierarchical recognition approach and Chinese natural language analysis","volume":"12","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3724671","publicationDate":"July 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mandarin dictation machine based upon a hierarchical recognition approach and Chinese natural language analysis","sourcePdf":"00056213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077056S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"7","articleId":"56213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":56215,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Developing measures to prevent communication interruptions caused by natural disasters, especially earthquakes, is a major priority of telecommunication service companies. Recent disaster damage in Japan is outlined, and preventive measures being taken by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) are described. NTT's design guidelines are based on three fundamental principles: improving network reliability, whereby facilities are physically reinforced and strengthened; preventing isolation, ensuring that communication with disaster-stricken districts is constant; and rapidly restoring services.

The nodal capabilities of connection (call) control and remote process invocation and management and other functions of the user parts of SS7 are examined. The very stringent performance requirements of signaling systems, which reflect the critical nature of signaling functions and their real-time exigencies, are stressed.

The second device, an innovative coprocessor that lets the processor execute single- or double-precision floating-point instructions concurrently with IU operations is described. Dedicated floating-point hardware in the FPU increases the performance of the system. Running at clock periods as small as 20 ns, the chip should deliver 5.5 million double-precision floating-point operations per second under the Linpack benchmark (50-MHz clock rate). The FPU provides single- and double-precision arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, compare, and convert. To minimize its math unit's latency, the FPU uses a highly parallel architecture requiring separate math units to optimize additions and multiplications. Traps stop the execution of a program to jump to software routine for handling data-dependent errors or to execute instructions not implemented in the hardware.

When more correlations exist between pixels, these techniques can be made more efficient. However, additional noise disrupts the correlation between adjacent pixels and leads to a less compressed result. Hence, prior to a systematic compression in a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), two main issues must be addressed: the true information range which exists in a specific type of radiological image, and the costs and benefits of compression for the PACS. It is shown that with laser film digitized magnetic resonance images, 10-12 b are produced, although the lower 2-4 b show the characteristics of random noise. The addition of the noise bits is shown to adversely affect the amount of compression given by various reversible compression techniques. The sensitivity of different techniques to different levels of noise is examined in order to suggest strategies for dealing with noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.56332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/2039/00056332.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.56332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise impact on error-free image compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1990","displayDocTitle":"Noise impact on error-free image compression","volume":"9","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3722381","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","pubMedId":"18222765","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise impact on error-free image compression","sourcePdf":"00056332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073538S","chronDate":"June  1990","isNumber":"2039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"25","articleId":"56332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":56334,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

The underlying principle is that the phenomena of attenuation, Compton scatter, and finite resolution can be separated and treated independently. Only finite resolution and its effects, along with a proposed method for correcting these effects, are addressed. A cardiac phantom with varying wall thickness (9-23 mm) was developed to characterize the dependence effects on /sup 201/Tl myocardial SPECT images. Correction factors in the form of recovery coefficients have been developed with the use of a convolution simulation, and are shown to improve substantially the agreement of counts extracted from SPECT images of the phantom with the actual /sup 201/Tl concentration. The degree of improvement, however, is markedly affected by external attenuation. Clinical application of this method will require corrections for attenuation and scatter or the development of regional recovery coefficients which include these effects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1990","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3722374","pubMedId":"18222758","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Effects of myocardial wall thickness on SPECT quantification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of myocardial wall thickness on SPECT quantification","sourcePdf":"00056338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056501S","chronDate":"June  1990","isNumber":"2039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"115","articleId":"56338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":56342,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By spreading a known bandwidth efficient modulation scheme, the power spectral density is controlled so that the transmitted spectrum will have a wide, flat mainlobe and rapid sidelobe rolloff. Coincidentally, the power efficient modulation allows transmission at lower signal-to-noise ratios when the receiver knows a priori the spreading sequence and modulation index sequence. Optimal receiver structures are derived and numerically evaluated in an additive white Gaussian noise environment. It is shown that performance is dependent on the spreading sequence, the modulation indexes, and the possible phase states and can exceed direct sequence binary phase-shift keying by 1-2 dB at bit error rates of 10/sup -5/. Composite likelihood ratio analysis reveals a reduction of 50-70% in detectability of completely known SSMH signals vis-a-vis direct-sequence binary phase shift keying (DS/BPSK) at error rates of 10/sup -4/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.56380","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"728","endPage":"742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2042/00056380.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.56380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread-spectrum multi-h modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Binary phase shift keying","Digital modulation","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Additive white noise","Phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Signal analysis","Phase detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shift keying","radio receivers","random noise","signal detection","spectral analysis","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal receiver structure","spread-spectrum multi-h modulation","direct random spreading sequence","additive white Gaussian noise","modulation indexes","phase states","direct sequence binary phase-shift keying","bit error rates","DS/BPSK"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Spread-spectrum multi-h modulation","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3733514","publicationDate":"June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56380/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread-spectrum multi-h modulation","sourcePdf":"00056380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092618S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","articleId":"56380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":56382,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

In the analysis, they model the network self-interference as a random variable which is equal to the sum of the interference power of all other terminals plus background noise. The model is applicable to other spread-spectrum schemes where the interference of one user appears as a noise source with constant power spectral density to the other users. The network terminals are modeled as a random Poisson field of interference power emitters. The statistics of the interference power at a receiving terminal are obtained and shown to be the stable distributions of a parameter that is dependent on the propagation power loss law. The optimum transmission range in such a network is of the form CK/sup alpha / where C is a constant, K is a function of the processing gain, the background noise power spectral density, and the degree of error-correction coding used, and alpha is related to the power loss law.

The pseudonoise (PN) codes in the transmitters of the base station are mutually synchronized. For this purpose, sets of Gold code sequences having low cross correlation have been found by an exhaustive computer search. Together with wideband measurements of the indoor radio channel at 900 MHz, a five-path RAKE receiver was designed to combat fading effects and to process the time diversity by using multipath signal reception. Each receiver path is demodulated independently. Several methods of diversity combining of these paths have been investigated. Acquisition and tracking of the spreading code in the receiver are controlled by a digital signal processor (DSP). Experimental results of the CDMA system are presented, showing the behavior in a multipath environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2042/00056384.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.56384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.56384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microcellular direct-sequence spread-spectrum radio system using N-path RAKE receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Multiaccess communication","Diversity reception","Local area networks","Fading","RAKE receivers","Indoor communication","Differential phase shift keying","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","diversity reception","local area networks","phase shift keying","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF","direct-sequence spread-spectrum radio system","N-path RAKE receiver","microcellular local area network","LAN","code-division multiple access","CDMA","differential phase-shift keying","DPSK","indoor radio channel","multipath signal reception","diversity combining","digital signal processor","900 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Microcellular direct-sequence spread-spectrum radio system using N-path RAKE receiver","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3733518","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microcellular direct-sequence spread-spectrum radio system using N-path RAKE receiver","sourcePdf":"00056384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03354S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"57","articleId":"56384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56386,"authors":[{"name":"S.-M.

Coherent and noncoherent interception receiver structures based on Neyman-Pearson detection theory are determined. Under the assumption that there is a single hop per detection period, the optimum receiver structure is shown to consist of a bank of matched filters called the average likelihood (AL) receiver. A suboptimum structure called the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver is also analyzed. It is shown that AL and ML receivers have essentially the same performance. Simple formulas that relate the probability of detection, P/sub D/, to the probability of false alarm, P/sub F/, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for large N are derived. Receiver structures are also derived and analyzed for the case where the signal hops a number of times in one detection interval. This may correspond to the detection of a multihop signal in one symbol interval or to detection based on integration over a number of symbol intervals. The relationships of P/sub D/ to P/sub F/, for both coherent and noncoherent multiple-hop receivers, are examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3733525","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Interception of frequency-hopped spread-spectrum signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interception of frequency-hopped spread-spectrum signals","sourcePdf":"00056391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033718S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"50","articleId":"56391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56392,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

Assuming this combination of PBTJ and FBNJ jamming, they consider three cases of receiver processing-the hard decision (HD) metric without JSI, the HD metric with perfect JSI, and the maximum-likelihood (ML) metric using Viterbi's ratio threshold (VRT) to generate a 1-b symbol decision quality indicator. System performance is evaluated in terms of the Chernoff bound on the probability of symbol error. From extensive numerical analysis the authors conclude that, for the case of the HD metric without JSI, PBTJ-only jamming is the worst form of jamming, as expected, since the receiver does not use JSI at all; for the other cases, a combination of PBTJ and FBNJ is the worst, with the worst ratio of PBTJ power to FBNJ power a function of the values of M and E/sub s//N/sub J/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Electronic countermeasures","Frequency shift keying","Signal to noise ratio","High definition video","Maximum likelihood decoding","System performance","Numerical analysis","Electronic warfare","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic countermeasures","frequency agility","frequency shift keying","jamming","probability","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard decision metric receiver","spread spectrum","maximum likelihood metric receiver","coded frequency-hopped/M-ary FSK","ECCM radios","partial-band tone jamming","full-band noise jamming","jamming state information","Viterbi's ratio threshold","Chernoff bound","probability","symbol error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56392","doi":"10.1109/49.56392","startPage":"871","endPage":"883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2042/00056392.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.56392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56392/","displayDocTitle":"Combined tone and noise jamming against coded FH/MFSK ECCM radios","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3733526","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined tone and noise jamming against coded FH/MFSK ECCM radios","sourcePdf":"00056392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029276S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"2","articleId":"56392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56394,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Two types of multipath intensity profiles are analyzed. Large values of the multipath spread (larger than a symbol duration) are considered, and a useful approximation to the symbol error probability, based on random spreading sequences, is derived. The effect of pulsed jamming on the performance is analyzed. Both the uncoded and the coded case are considered.

The optical throughput was measured as the fiber was being pulled to produce the required radial profile. The tapered single-mode fiber was bent in a simple fixture, and the optical throughput was measured as a function of the bending angle. It is seen that the bending resulted in very strong oscillations of the optical power as the bend angle was varied. At the point when the light in the core was minimal, the cladding region was bright, indicating that the light has moved to the cladding.

These effects impose stringent limitations on the maximum data rates that can be carried in such systems. The limitations arise as soliton amplitude or frequency fluctuations are translated into pulse position jitter after propagation along a fiber. Estimates of the maximum data rates in single-channel and multichannel soliton systems are obtained and are compared with data rates in linear direct detection systems. A single-channel soliton system can, in principle, carry data at a rate of between two and ten times faster than a simple, direct-detection, linear system.

Present algorithms either do not let you draw tree nodes of varying shapes and sizes or they draw such trees in a way that does not produce trees as compact as they could be, which is especially important when diagramming a large system. Also, they cannot reuse layout information when the trees changes, so after every change the layout must be recomputed and the tree redrawn. The main difference between these traditional approaches and the author's approach is that his algorithm is more geometric. Unlike other algorithms, it uses an explicit representation of node and subtree contours, and it stores every contour as a polygon. It has three advantages over traditional algorithms. It allows one to draw trees with nodes of any polygonal shape compactly. The data structure supports insert and delete operations on subtrees. It is simple to implement, yet flexible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/52.56447","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Software","startPage":"21","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"IEEE Software","pdfPath":"/iel1/52/2044/00056447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/52.56447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drawing dynamic trees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tree graphs","Binary trees","Tree data structures","Shape","Graphical user interfaces","Computer science","Data structures","Mirrors","User interfaces","Head"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","trees (mathematics)","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric algorithm","node contours","dynamic trees","tree-drawing algorithm","graphical user interfaces","explicit representation","subtree contours","polygonal shape","data structure","insert","delete","subtrees"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1990","displayDocTitle":"Drawing dynamic trees","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3723524","publicationDate":"July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56447/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drawing dynamic trees","sourcePdf":"00056447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023997S","chronDate":"July  1990","isNumber":"2044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"47","articleId":"56447","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56474,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

Measurement of the spectral performance of two types of analog dividers is reported: a parametric divider using varactor diodes and a regenerative-type divider incorporating a double-balanced mixer in the oscillator feedback circuit. Both dividers were configured for divide-by-two operation at VHF. Evaluation indicates the regenerative divider is capable of providing much lower phase noise than conventional digital logic level devices. The regenerative divider can be successfully operated over bandwidths in excess of an octave, and the design lends itself to small (i.e. TO-8) modular package implementation. Operating frequencies are bounded only by the range of the mixer and RF amplifier utilized and, as such, should extend from HF through microwave.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.56490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/2047/00056490.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"301","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00056490.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.56490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56490/","displayDocTitle":"Phase noise performance of analog frequency dividers","volume":"37","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3737230","pubMedId":"18285044","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase noise performance of analog frequency dividers","sourcePdf":"00056490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031928S","chronDate":"July  1990","isNumber":"2047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"19","articleId":"56490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":56492,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

The disks are of the type used as active elements in compressional wave ultrasonic transducers, and are electrically polarized in thickness with full electrodes on the disk's major faces. To optimize disk geometry for ultrasonic transducer application, the dependence of the vibrational modes on the disk diameter-to-thickness ratio for ratios from 0.2 (a tall cylinder) to 10.0 (a thin disk) has been studied. Series and parallel resonance frequencies for each of the modes are determined through an eigenfrequency analysis, and effective electromechanical coupling coefficients are calculated. The modal displacement fields in the disk are calculated to determine the physical nature of each mode. An analysis of the complete spectrum of piezoelectrically active modes as a function of diameter-thickness ratio is presented for the ceramic PZT-5H, including and identification of radial, edge, length expander, thickness shear, and thickness extensional vibrations.

The basic configurations of the voltage-mode resonant switches are presented. The circuit's operating principles are described using a voltage-mode quasi-resonant boost converter. DC analysis of the converter is carried out. A new family of voltage-mode quasi-resonant converters are derived, and several members of this family are presented. The duality relationship between the zero-current switching technique and the zero-voltage switching technique is derived. These two techniques are compared using an example showing the duality between a current-mode quasi-resonant Buck converter and a voltage-mode quasi-resonant boost converter. The similarities and differences of the voltage-mode quasi-resonant converters and the Class-E converters are discussed. A 5 MHz 50 V to 5 V flyback converter employing the zero-voltage switching technique has been implemented.

These two studies were performed using the DCG/EPRI EMTP Version 1.0. The third application is to the 2000 MW high voltage direct current (HVDC) link between France and Great Britain. As part of a simulation exercise to check the protection settings and calculate the transient disturbances due to the switching-in of equipment or fault clearing near the station, the converter transformers were modeled using the EMTP saturated transformer model. Comparisons between the simulations and actual field tests are shown for the line energization and transformer switching transients studies.

The notion of a base parameter is useful for an efficient and accurate identification of the manipulator dynamic model. A set of inertial parameters described in linear combinations of link parameters directly and completely in closed form is given and proved to constitute a base parameter set. It can be derived from this that the minimum number of inertial parameters whose values can determine the dynamic model is 7N-4 beta /sub 1/ (7N-4 beta /sub 2/-2 if the first joint axis parallel to the gravity vector), where N is the number of links in the manipulator, and beta /sub 1/ is the number of links connected by joints whose axes are always parallel to the first joint axis. After defining the base parameter, it is also shown that any base parameter set can be obtained from one base parameter set by a nonsingular linear transformation. The method adopted has the potential advantage of determining the relations between base parameters and manipulator motions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","accessionNumber":"3727505","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Base parameters of manipulator dynamic models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base parameters of manipulator dynamic models","sourcePdf":"00056663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061797S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"164","articleId":"56663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56664,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The involvement of the forces is the motivation for a consideration of compliance. The compliant coordination control scheme of two moving robots is presented. One robot is equipped with a force/torque sensing wrist, which provides force feedback signals and permits the fine coordinated motion control of complex assembly tasks. A control strategy is derived so that the measured force/torque can be used to modify the trajectory of one of the robots. This control scheme can be realized in real time by using the proposed computational structure. The system stability is related to the force-displacement conversion gain in the forward path. An experiment that screws a moving nut onto a moving bolt has been carried out as an illustration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","publicationDate":"June 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3727506","volume":"6","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compliant coordination control of two moving industrial robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compliant coordination control of two moving industrial robots","sourcePdf":"00056664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064009S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"77","articleId":"56664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56849,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

Certain basic aspects of the architecture of VSAT data networks are discussed. Although spread spectrum and ALOHA have different origins and are sometimes represented as competing technologies, they can in fact be characterized as different ways of viewing the same low-dimensional signals in a high-dimensional signal space. After a brief introduction to the architecture of VSAT networks, it is shown how a simple linear transformation of conventional ALOHA packets called spread ALOHA leads to signals identical in all respects to the most common form of spread-spectrum signals. Two practical consequences of this theoretical result are discussed. First, for the case of small earth stations it is not possible to find an Access technique with a higher throughput than spread ALOHA. Second, the use of different spreading sequences for different users in a packet network using spread spectrum is not necessary for user separation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1990","volume":"78","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3761822","displayDocTitle":"VSAT data networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VSAT data networks","sourcePdf":"00056937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042499S","chronDate":"July  1990","isNumber":"2061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"29","articleId":"56937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":56938,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The planar array consists of many vertical resonant linear array elements; i.e. single ridge waveguides with broadwall shunt slots, closely spaced to avoid array grating lobes when the array is scanned in azimuth. Traditional linear broadwall slot arrays require alternating slot displacement from the waveguide centerline, which generates undesirable secondary beams in skewed directions during electronic scan. To eliminate the secondary beams, a design has been devised in which all slots are exactly collinear and lie on the waveguide centerline. The methods considered to achieve the required waveguide asymmetry, the design procedure used in the successful approach, and the experimental results obtained with a demonstration model are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2062/00056951.pdf","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.56951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.56951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric ridge waveguide radiating element for a scanned planar array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planar waveguides","Planar arrays","Arrayed waveguide gratings","Azimuth","Waveguide theory","Waveguide components","Life members","Resonance","Brain modeling","Polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microwave antenna arrays","scanning antennas","waveguide antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collinear slots","waveguide antenna","low sidelobe","radiation pattern","scanned planar array","linear array radiating element","planar slot array","vertical resonant linear array elements","ridge waveguides","broadwall shunt slots","alternating slot displacement","electronic scan","waveguide centerline","waveguide asymmetry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric ridge waveguide radiating element for a scanned planar array","volume":"38","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758063","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric ridge waveguide radiating element for a scanned planar array","sourcePdf":"00056951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037503S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","articleId":"56951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":56954,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

For these functions, convergence is predictable and rapid because the majority of the strips are located away from the edges of the scatterer. This choice also facilitates the use of the physical optics approximation as a good initial guess. Once the solutions for all the unit basis functions over the body are known, they can be combined to synthesize the solution for any excitation using the weighting coefficients associated with the expansion of the incident field. Numerical examples are given, and they demonstrate the substantial savings achieved by adopting this approach for the analysis of multiple excitations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","volume":"38","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3758072","displayDocTitle":"A concise conjugate gradient computation of plate problems with many excitations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A concise conjugate gradient computation of plate problems with many excitations","sourcePdf":"00056960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092752S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","articleId":"56960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":56971,"authors":[{"name":"R.Q.

The main emphasis of the theory is placed on the transition region around the boundary of the geometrical optics (GO) field. The theory describes the field near the GO boundary in terms of a standard function and a wavelength-dependent parameter Delta rho , where Delta rho represents the lateral extent of the transition region. The field around the GO boundary can thereby be constructed solely from knowledge of the single parameter Delta rho . Formulas are presented for tracing Delta rho along the GO boundary from a diffraction point at a certain edge via other possible reflectors.

The large parameter in this asymptotic development is proportional to the lateral separation between the source and field points along the air-dielectric interface. This asymptotic solution remains surprisingly accurate even for very small (a few tenths of a free-space wavelength) lateral separation of the source and field points. Thus, using the present asymptotic approximation of the Green's function can lead to a very efficient moment method (MM) solution for the currents on an array of microstrip antenna patches and feed lines. Numerical results based on the efficient MM analysis using the present closed-form asymptotic approximation to the microstrip surface Green's function are given for the mutual coupling between a pair of printed dipoles on a single-layer grounded dielectric slab. The accuracy of the latter calculation is confirmed by comparison with numerical results based on a MM analysis which employs an exact integral representation for the microstrip Green's function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2063/00056988.pdf","startPage":"1374","endPage":"1383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.56988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.56988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asymptotic closed-form microstrip surface Green's function for the efficient moment method analysis of mutual coupling in microstrip antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Green's function methods","Moment methods","Microstrip antenna arrays","Microstrip antennas","Mutual coupling","Slabs","Laboratories","Current","Dielectric substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","Green's function methods","microstrip antennas","microwave antenna arrays","numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patch antenna array","numerical results","Green's function","efficient moment method analysis","mutual coupling","microstrip antennas","closed-form asymptotic representation","single-layer microstrip dyadic surface","air-dielectric interface","lateral separation","feed lines","printed dipoles","single-layer grounded dielectric slab"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/56988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"An asymptotic closed-form microstrip surface Green's function for the efficient moment method analysis of mutual coupling in microstrip antennas","volume":"38","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758095","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asymptotic closed-form microstrip surface Green's function for the efficient moment method analysis of mutual coupling in microstrip antennas","sourcePdf":"00056988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030839S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"68","articleId":"56988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57001,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance achievable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.57004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2063/00057004.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.57004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1496","endPage":"1498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear antenna array pattern synthesis with prescribed broad nulls","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Linear antenna array pattern synthesis with prescribed broad nulls","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57004/","volume":"38","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758111","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear antenna array pattern synthesis with prescribed broad nulls","sourcePdf":"00057004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039609S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"84","articleId":"57004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":57016,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The relationship between appropriately defined controllability, stabilizability properties, and the solution of the infinite time jump linear quadratic (JLQ) optimal control problems is also examined. Although the solution of the continuous-time Markov JLQ problem with finite or infinite time horizons is known, only sufficient conditions for the existence of finite cost, constant, stabilizing controls for the infinite time problem appear in the literature. In this paper necessary and sufficient conditions are established. These conditions are based on new definitions of controllability, observability, stabilizability, and detectability that are appropriate for continuous-time Markovian jump linear systems. These definitions play the same role for the JLQ problem as the deterministic properties do for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.57016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2064/00057016.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.57016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2064","startPage":"777","endPage":"788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controllability, stabilizability, and continuous-time Markovian jump linear quadratic control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Controllability, stabilizability, and continuous-time Markovian jump linear quadratic control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3746395","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controllability, stabilizability, and continuous-time Markovian jump linear quadratic control","sourcePdf":"00057016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045263S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"757","articleId":"57016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":57020,"authors":[{"name":"D.Q.

A hardware model is presented of a floating-point numeric coprocessor consisting of a fast adder and a fast multiplier, and the minimum hardware required for evaluation of the elementary functions is added to it. Next, rational approximations for evaluating the elementary functions and testing the accuracy of the results are derived. The calculation time of these approximations in the proposed numeric processor is then estimated.

Redundant logarithmic arithmetic, like conventional logarithmic arithmetic, relies on table lookups to make the arithmetic unit simpler than an equivalent floating point unit. The cost of 32 bit subtraction in a redundant logarithmic number system is lower than previously published logarithmic subtraction methods. The total memory requirement for a 29-bit redundant logarithmic unit is 16 K words compared to 22 K words by the best previously published conventional sign logarithm unit, assuming similar addition techniques are employed. A redundant logarithmic number system can be implemented with online arithmetic, which would be impractical for a conventional sign logarithm number system. The disadvantages of redundant arithmetic are typical of redundant number systems. First, the redundancy doubles the storage requirements for data values. Second, the representation can become ill-conditioned, especially as a result of iterated multiplications. Third, division and square root operations are more difficult to implement in redundant logarithmic arithmetic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.57046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2065/00057046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.57046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2065","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundant logarithmic arithmetic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Redundant logarithmic arithmetic","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3746474","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundant logarithmic arithmetic","sourcePdf":"00057046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059237S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"44","articleId":"57046","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":57055,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The authors propose the detection and location of faulty processors concurrently with the actual execution of parallel applications on the hypercube using a novel scheme of algorithm-based error detection. System-level error detection mechanisms have been implemented for three parallel applications on a 16-processor Intel iPSC hypercube multiprocessor: matrix multiplication, Gaussian elimination, and fast Fourier transform. Schemes for other applications are under development. Extensive studies have been done of error coverage of the system-level error detection schemes in the presence of finite-precision arithmetic, which affects the system-level encodings. Two reconfiguration schemes are proposed that allow the authors to isolate and replace faulty processors with spare processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.57055","startPage":"1132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2066/00057055.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.57055","endPage":"1145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm-based fault tolerance on a hypercube multiprocessor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm-based fault tolerance on a hypercube multiprocessor","volume":"39","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3746476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm-based fault tolerance on a hypercube multiprocessor","sourcePdf":"00057055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05354S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"95","articleId":"57055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57057,"authors":[{"name":"J.-Y.

Each task is logically decomposed into a mandatory part followed by an optional part. In a feasible schedule, the mandatory part of every task is completed before the deadline of the task.

The crane offers a uniform environment for a complete control engineering design starting from modeling and ending with tuning of different controllers. The potential possibilities of the crane environment for practical education of control engineering are described. The modeling issues are considered, and different identification methods are compared. Different control algorithms are applied to the load transfer in the pilot crane. The experiments show that the controllers must adapt automatically to the rope length. The velocity-controlled crane, which is a standard in industry, is the focus of the discussion. An illustrative open-loop minimum-time control is derived for the load transfer. A simple root-locus method is used to tune a cascade type of PID controller, which works satisfactorily with fixed rope length. Different pole-placement methods suffered from sensitivity and robustness problems. Good results are achieved after ill-conditioning is understood and avoided. As an example, an adaptive pole-placement control law which was tested successfully is provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/13.57076","startPage":"298","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/13.57076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2067","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel1/13/2067/00057076.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control study with a pilot crane","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57076/","displayDocTitle":"Control study with a pilot crane","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3746468","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control study with a pilot crane","sourcePdf":"00057076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040769S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"34","articleId":"57076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":57096,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The most important factor is the recovery rather than the reignition condition. A formula expressing the resistance of the pollution layer on the insulator is derived. From this, the flashover voltage of a polluted insulator of complex shape can be calculated. A computer program has been developed to calculate the flashover under both DC and AC. Some arc phenomena, such as arc bridging between the sheds or ribs of insulators, the drift of the arc from the insulator surface, and the number of arcs in series before flashover, are taken into account. Much experimentation has been done to determine the flashover voltages of polluted insulators with complex shapes under both DC and AC.

Materials that are highly dispersive, such as snow, ice, plasma, and radar-absorbing material, can be considered efficiently by using this formulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/15.57116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.57116","endPage":"227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/2069/00057116.pdf","startPage":"222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain formulation for dispersive materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57116/","displayDocTitle":"A frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain formulation for dispersive materials","volume":"32","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3758290","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain formulation for dispersive materials","sourcePdf":"00057116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043365S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"485","articleId":"57116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":57128,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Experimental results confirmed that 1.1E/sub c/L/sub eff/ predicts a good guideline for power-supply voltage for CMOS devices over a wide range of gate oxide thickness (7-45 nm) and design rule (0.3-2.0 mu m). On the basis of theoretical models and experimental results, trends for power-supply voltage with MOS device scaling are demonstrated. It is shown that 1.1E/sub c/L/sub eff/ can be regarded as the lower power-supply voltage limit in order to maintain the improvement in delay time for below 0.6- mu m channel length at reduced power supply.

The dead space is the minimum distance that a newly generated carrier must travel in order to acquire sufficient energy to cause an impact ionization. Analytical expressions are derived for the mean gain, the excess noise factor, and the mean and standard deviation of the impulse response function, for the dead-space-modified avalanche photodiode (DAPD), under conditions of single carrier multiplication. The results differ considerably from the well-known formulas derived by R.J. McIntyre and S.D. Personick in the absence of dead space. Relatively simple asymptotic expressions for the mean gain and excess noise factor are obtained for devices with long multiplication regions. In terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an optical receiver in the presence of circuit noise, it is established that there is a salutory effect of using a properly designed DAPD in place of a conventional APD. The relative merits of using DAPD versus a multilayer (superlattice) avalanche photodiode (SAPD) are examined in the context of receiver SNR; the best choice turns out to depend on which device parameters are used for the comparison.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.57159","startPage":"1976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2071/00057159.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.57159","endPage":"1984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of dead space on the excess noise factor and time response of avalanche photodiodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Effect of dead space on the excess noise factor and time response of avalanche photodiodes","volume":"37","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3758145","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of dead space on the excess noise factor and time response of avalanche photodiodes","sourcePdf":"00057159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086399S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"83","articleId":"57159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57162,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.S.

The model also shows that it is possible to fabricate submicrometer transistors on very thin SOI even if the channel doping is nearly intrinsic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional analytic modeling of very thin SOI MOSFETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.57162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2071/00057162.pdf","startPage":"1999","endPage":"2006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.57162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional analytic modeling of very thin SOI MOSFETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758148","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional analytic modeling of very thin SOI MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00057162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041119S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"54","articleId":"57162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":57168,"authors":[{"name":"K.

By using orthogonal Volterra series, the authors derive a canonical representation for discrete nonlinear systems, based on a linear convolutional code and a memoryless mapper. This representation shows that finite-memory, discrete nonlinear systems can be analyzed in much the same way as TCM (trellis-coded modulation) schemes. In particular, TCM over nonlinear channels can be analyzed. A technique is derived that expresses an upper bound to error probability based on the computation of the transfer of a state diagram with N branches, and whose branch labels are matrices rather than scalars. Some examples of its application are given. In particular, error bounds are derived for nonlinear TCM schemes and for TCM schemes operating on nonlinear channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Nonlinear systems","Transfer functions","Nonlinear distortion","Upper bound","Data communication","Telephony","Delay","Radio link","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication systems","encoding","error statistics","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital transmission","nonlinear channels","TCM","lower bounds","error probability","finite memory","orthogonal Volterra series","discrete nonlinear systems","linear convolutional code","memoryless mapper","trellis-coded modulation","upper bound"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.57209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2073/00057209.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.57209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error probability for digital transmission over nonlinear channels with application to TCM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error probability for digital transmission over nonlinear channels with application to TCM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57209/","volume":"36","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3758203","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error probability for digital transmission over nonlinear channels with application to TCM","sourcePdf":"00057209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041516S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"36","articleId":"57209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":57210,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The method features sensitivity and accuracy greater than, or at least as high as, that of other methods, and is applied to the determination of the flux-linkage-versus-current diagrams of a variable-reluctance (VR) motor. Two different methods are proposed to determine flux variations in the motor magnetic circuit, and the results of the experimental work carried out on a typical 4-kW switched reluctance (SR) motor, show that the methods are in good agreement. The methods allow quicker and more accurate determination of the flux-linkage characteristics than other proposed methods, and allow the measurement of flux-linkage values for any value of the excitation current and of the rotor position. For this reason, the methods are useful for the determination of flux-linkage characteristics to be used in the analytical prediction of VR motor performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3768613","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A digital method for the determination of the magnetic characteristic of variable reluctance motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital method for the determination of the magnetic characteristic of variable reluctance motors","sourcePdf":"00057241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072343S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"38","articleId":"57241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":57256,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

It is shown that computing the degree of belief in a hypothesis in the D-S theory can be formulated as an optimization problem. The extended belief function is thus obtained by generalizing the objective function and the constraints of the optimization problem. To combine bodies of evidence that may contain vague information, Dempster's rule (1967) is extended by (1) combining generalized compatibility relations based on the possibility theory, and (2) normalizing combination results to account for partially conflicting evidence. The generalization not only extends the application of the D-S theory but also illustrates a way that probability theory and fuzzy set theory can be integrated in a sound manner in order to deal with different kinds of uncertain information in intelligent systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.57269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.57269","endPage":"570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/2075/00057269.pdf","startPage":"559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalizing the Dempster-Schafer theory to fuzzy sets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57269/","displayDocTitle":"Generalizing the Dempster-Schafer theory to fuzzy sets","volume":"20","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3746662","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalizing the Dempster-Schafer theory to fuzzy sets","sourcePdf":"00057269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030713S","chronDate":"May-June  1990","isNumber":"2075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"194","articleId":"57269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":57271,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.G.

Experiments for computing the inverse dynamics of a six-jointed PUMA-like manipulator based on the Newton-Euler dynamic equations were implemented on an NCUBE/ten hypercube computer to verify the proposed mapping algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.57271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/2075/00057271.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.57271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2075","startPage":"582","endPage":"595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient mapping algorithms for scheduling robot inverse dynamics computation on a multiprocessor system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient mapping algorithms for scheduling robot inverse dynamics computation on a multiprocessor system","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57271/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1990","accessionNumber":"3746664","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient mapping algorithms for scheduling robot inverse dynamics computation on a multiprocessor system","sourcePdf":"00057271.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053945S","chronDate":"May-June  1990","isNumber":"2075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"14","articleId":"57271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":57273,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The scheme has been used successfully in designing a self-tuning controller for force regulation in a computer numerically controlled (CNC) milling machine. In this scheme, frames are used for knowledge representation and rules of logic for reasoning. This synergistic combination of frames and rules provides the environment for intelligent control. As a consequence of representing knowledge in frames, the large amount of logic that goes along with most conventionally designed adaptive controllers to ensure safe operation is considerably reduced. Procedural attachments to the slots in the frame replace the extra logic elements in the knowledge-based controller. The self-tuning controller for the CNC milling machine is implemented on a 32-b microprocessor-based computer running at 20 MHz. The knowledge representation and the reasoning process are implemented in Prolog, whereas the numerical algorithms are written in C. Simulations and experimental results are provided that demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1990","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1990","accessionNumber":"3746666","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-based adaptive computer control in manufacturing systems: a case study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-based adaptive computer control in manufacturing systems: a case study","sourcePdf":"00057273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179608S","chronDate":"May-June  1990","isNumber":"2075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"20","articleId":"57273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57276,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

First, an efficient solution and the corresponding local tradeoff information are provided by the analyst. Then, the decision maker determines the preference direction and step size. Again the analyst looks for a new efficient solution according to the preference information; the new solution should dominate the previous one. In ISTM, the efficient solution and the local tradeoff information, the current values of objective functions, and the tradeoff rates between them are obtained by solving an auxiliary problem. The auxiliary problem is defined, and relationships between the optimal solutions of the auxiliary problem and the efficient solutions of the original problem are explored. The relationships between the Kuhn-Tucker multipliers (or simplex multipliers) of the auxiliary problems and the tradeoff rates are analyzed. The particular steps of the ISTM algorithm are given.

The scheme is achieved by concatenating a Reed-Solomon outer code and a bandwidth efficient block inner code for M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Error performance of the scheme is analyzed for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. It is shown that extremely high reliability can be attained by using a simple M-ary PSK modulation inner-code and a relatively powerful Reed-Solomon outer code. Furthermore, if an inner code of high effective rate is used, the bandwidth expansion required by the scheme due to coding will be greatly reduced. The scheme is particularly effective for high-speed satellite communications for large file transfer where high reliability is required. A simple method is also presented for constructing block codes for M-ary PSK modulation. Soome short M-ary PSK codes with good minimum squared Euclidean distance are constructed. These codes have trellis structure and hence can be decoded with a soft-decision Viterbi decoding algorithm.

Dynamic trellis search operations are paralleled and well formulated into a set of simple matrix operations referred to as the Viterbi transform (VT). Based on the VT, the excessive memory accesses and complicated data transfer scheme demanded by the trellis search are eliminated. Efficient VLSI array implementations of the VT have been developed.

It consists of a whitened matched filter followed by a sequential algorithm. A key component of a sequential estimator is a suitable metric that accounts for the unequal search depth.

Computer simulations for three different channels show that the sequential sequence estimator has considerably less computational complexity than a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator using the Viterbi algorithm (MLSE-VA), while still maintaining the optimum estimation performance of the MLSE-VA, a performance not achievable with any reduced-state Viterbi algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intersymbol interference","Viterbi algorithm","Computational complexity","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Equalizers","Feedback","Delay estimation","Matched filters","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","filtering and prediction theory","intersymbol interference","matched filters","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite intersymbol interference","sequential sequence estimator","infinite intersymbol interference","whitened matched filter","sequential algorithm","metric","ISI channel","computational complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.57472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2081/00057472.pdf","startPage":"795","endPage":"804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.57472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential sequence estimation for channels with intersymbol interference of finite or infinite length","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequential sequence estimation for channels with intersymbol interference of finite or infinite length","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57472/","volume":"38","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3758503","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential sequence estimation for channels with intersymbol interference of finite or infinite length","sourcePdf":"00057472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040488S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"33","articleId":"57472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":57476,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.M.

Without proper countermeasures, this distortion can degrade system performance appreciably due to two basic mechanisms. The first, which can result in a system power penalty of as much as 10 dB, occurs in a standard decision circuit that automatically sets the threshold voltage to the average signal level, rather than in the middle of the eye opening. The second mechanism, which occurs even with the threshold set properly, is due to the nonlinear enhancement of the simple linear intersymbol interference (ISI) within the receiver filter. For example, computations of system performance at 8 Gb/s using an RC filter that gives a quite acceptable 10% of eye closure under linear conditions show that when the amplifier is driven to its saturation output power level, this mechanism causes a system power penalty of about 1 dB, which increases to about 4.5 dB when the power is doubled. Interestingly, with the proper threshold setting, an ideal integrate-and-dump receiver, which introduces no ISI, is shown to suffer no power penalty due to amplifier nonlinearity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.57476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.57476","startPage":"839","endPage":"846","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2081/00057476.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of semiconductor-optical-amplifier nonlinearity on the performance of high-speed intensity-modulation lightwave systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Effects of semiconductor-optical-amplifier nonlinearity on the performance of high-speed intensity-modulation lightwave systems","publicationDate":"June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3758507","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57476/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of semiconductor-optical-amplifier nonlinearity on the performance of high-speed intensity-modulation lightwave systems","sourcePdf":"00057476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046684S","chronDate":"Jun 1990","isNumber":"2081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","articleId":"57476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":57477,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The derived expressions can be evaluated at any location in the serving cell. Error-probability can be calculated by averaging over all possible locations within the serving cell. By evaluating these bounds, numerical results for the following cases are presented: without diversity reception, microdiversity combining, macrodiversity selection, and simultaneous use of macrodiversity selection and microdiversity combining. For symmetrical arrangement of macrodiversity ports against the lognormal shadowing, error probability at the equidistant point gives upper bounds on the error probabilities for most of the area in the serving cell.

The adaptive transform coding of W.H. Chen and C.H. Smith (1977) is utilized to classify an image into four equally populated subblocks based on their AC energies. The modulation transfer function (MTF) of the HVS model is obtained experimentally, based on processing a number of test images. A simplified technique for incorporating the MTF into the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain is utilized. In the hierarchical image buildup, the image is first reconstructed from the DC coefficients of all subblocks. Further transmission hierarchy of transform coefficients and consequent image buildup are dependent on their HVS weighted variances. The HVS weighted reconstructed images are compared to the ones without any weighting at several stages. The HVS weighted progressive image transmission results in perceptually higher quality images compared to the unweighted scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Image communication","Transform coding","Image reconstruction","Discrete cosine transforms","Picture archiving and communication systems","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image coding","Visual system","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","picture processing","visual communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT domain","image coding","progressive image transmission","transform coding","human visual system","modulation transfer function","discrete cosine transform","hierarchical image buildup","weighted variances"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.57501","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2082/00057501.pdf","doi":"10.1109/26.57501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human visual weighted progressive image transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Human visual weighted progressive image transmission","accessionNumber":"3758527","publicationDate":"July 1990","volume":"38","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human visual weighted progressive image transmission","sourcePdf":"00057501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031188S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"95","articleId":"57501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":57504,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The case of a Gaussian interferer with known autoregressive parameters is considered. Using simulations, it is shown that an approximate conditional mean (ACM) filter of the Masreliez type performs significantly better than the optimum linear (Kalman-Bucy) filter. For the case of interferers with unknown parameters, the nature of the nonlinearity in the ACM filter is used to obtain an adaptive filtering algorithm that is identical to the linear transversal filter except that the previous prediction errors are transformed nonlinearly before being incorporated into the linear prediction. Two versions of this filter are considered: one in which the filter coefficients are updated using the Widrow LMS algorithm, and another in which the coefficients are updated using an approximate gradient algorithm. Simulations indicate that the nonlinear filter with LMS updates performs substantially better than the linear filter for both narrowband Gaussian and single-tone interferers, whereas the gradient algorithm gives slightly better performance for Gaussian interferers but is rather ineffective in suppressing a sinusoidal interferer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.57504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2082/00057504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.57504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2082","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear techniques for interference suppression in spread-spectrum systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear techniques for interference suppression in spread-spectrum systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3758530","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear techniques for interference suppression in spread-spectrum systems","sourcePdf":"00057504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029262S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"147","articleId":"57504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57505,"authors":[{"name":"E.

For systems with binary FSK modulation this method provides an accurate approximation and a tight upper bound to the bit error probability; for systems with M-ary FSK modulation, it provides tight upper bounds to the symbol error probability. The method enables the computationally efficient averaging of the error probability with respect to the delays, phase angles, and data streams of the different users. It relies on the integration of the product of the characteristic function of the envelope of the branch of the BFSK demodulator, which carries the desired signal, and of the derivative of the characteristic function of the envelope of the other branch. For sufficient frequency separation between the BFSK tones, the method can achieve any desirable accuracy. Moreover, the computational effort required for its evaluation grows linearly with the number of interfering users. In the M-ary case, tight upper bounds based on the union bound and the results of the binary case are derived. The method allows the effect of unequal power levels on other-user interference in FH/SSMA systems to be quantified accurately for the first time. The results indicate that the FH/SSMA systems suffer from the near-far problem, although less seriously than direct-sequence SSMA systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-access capability of frequency-hopped spread-spectrum revisited: an analysis of the effect of unequal power levels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.57505","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2082/00057505.pdf","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.57505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-access capability of frequency-hopped spread-spectrum revisited: an analysis of the effect of unequal power levels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3758531","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-access capability of frequency-hopped spread-spectrum revisited: an analysis of the effect of unequal power levels","sourcePdf":"00057505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051266S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"64","articleId":"57505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":57509,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.

The electromagnetic properties that are essential to an understanding of these plasmas, which can be modeled as cold collisional plasmas, is discussed. Gas and plasma characteristics, such as momentum-transfer collision rate, plasma lifetime, recombination kinetics, and the effect of noble gases, are presented. Typical collision rates and plasma lifetimes at atmospheric pressure are quantified. Applications for a plasma with a gradient are discussed. They include a high-altitude plasma that can reflect or absorb from HF to VHF and a broadband atmospheric pressure absorber. The generation and use of plasma, including electron impact ionization with a high-energy electron-beam source and UV photoionization of an alkali vapor or an organic vapor such as tetrakis (dimethylamino)ethylene (TMAE), is described.

The ML method (MLM) results from the application of the ML principle to the statistics of the observed raw data. The standard multiple signal classification (MUSIC) procedure, called MUSIC-1, is obtained as a brute-force approximation of the MLM. An improved MUSIC procedure, named MUSIC-2, is obtained by applying the ML principle to the statistics of certain linear combinations of the sample noise space eigenvectors. A procedure which compromises between the good performance of the MLM and the computational simplicity of MUSIC is a method of direction estimation (MODE-1) which is derived as a large sample realization of the MLM. A fifth method, called MODE-2, is obtained by using the ML principle on the statistics of certain linear combinations of the sample eigenvectors. MODE-2 is computationally less demanding than the MLM (it is of the same complexity as MODE-1) and statistically more efficient. A numerical comparison of these five DOA estimation methods is presented. It confirms the analytic results on their theoretical performance levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","volume":"38","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"3758611","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood methods for direction-of-arrival estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood methods for direction-of-arrival estimation","sourcePdf":"00057542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041796S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"593","articleId":"57542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":57547,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.W.

All major cell resources can operate concurrently. The many practical details of implementing systolic array algorithms on an array of SAC/MAC cells are fully presented. A library of macros for commonly used program segments is described. Key issues are discussed such as programming the MAC, scaling operands, loading RAM, synchronizing cells, delaying data, unloading results, combining the macros into a program, and pipelining a program. Two systolic algorithms are developed: matrix multiplication on a linear array, and matrix multiplication on a two-dimensional array. With a two-dimensional array, a series of pipelined matrix-matrix multiplications uses the MAC every cycle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2084/00057547.pdf","startPage":"1198","endPage":"1210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.57547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.57547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and programming of a flexible, cost-effective systolic array cell for digital signal processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Systolic arrays","Signal processing","Costs","Arithmetic","Digital signal processing chips","Pipeline processing","Routing","Digital signal processing","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","computerised signal processing","digital signal processing chips","macros","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programming","systolic array cell","digital signal processing","NCR45CM16","CMOS multiplier/accumulator","systolic array controller","macros","scaling operands","loading RAM","synchronizing cells","delaying data","unloading results","pipelining","matrix multiplication","linear array","two-dimensional array","matrix-matrix multiplications","16 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Design and programming of a flexible, cost-effective systolic array cell for digital signal processing","volume":"38","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1990","accessionNumber":"3758616","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and programming of a flexible, cost-effective systolic array cell for digital signal processing","sourcePdf":"00057547.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057142S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"9","articleId":"57547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57550,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The detector can be viewed as a likelihood radio test between sampled higher-order statistics, and its performance is evaluated using binary hypothesis testing.

A novel stabilization technique is proposed to overcome the problem caused by the accumulation of roundoff errors, and, in addition, degree-one prediction is incorporated into the algorithm to improve the effectiveness of the estimation process. Various estimators are described, the results of a series of computer-simulation tests are presented, and the accuracies of the channel estimates given by the different systems are compared. The new FTF algorithm gives a substantially better performance than the conventional algorithm from which it is derived, and it involves only a small increase in complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2085/00057570.pdf","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.57570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.57570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2085","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HF channel estimation using a fast transversal filter algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hafnium","Channel estimation","Transversal filters","Resonance light scattering","Roundoff errors","Data communication","Least squares approximation","Signal processing algorithms","System testing","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","Kalman filters","least squares approximations","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HF channel estimation","RLS algorithm","fast transversal filter algorithm","sampled impulse response","recursive least squares","Kalman filter","digital data transmission","roundoff errors","degree-one prediction","computer-simulation tests"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"HF channel estimation using a fast transversal filter algorithm","volume":"38","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758632","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HF channel estimation using a fast transversal filter algorithm","sourcePdf":"00057570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064088S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"8","articleId":"57570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":57573,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

It is based on the union of number theoretic transforms, modular arithmetic, and distributed arithmetic. In order to achieve megahertz-class transform rates with a limited amount of hardware, several new technologies are integrated. To accelerate complex arithmetic speed, a new body of knowledge called the quadratic residue number system (QRNS) is employed. To overcome the overflow management problem introduced by the QRNS, a finite impulse response form of the DFT, known as the prime factor transform (PFT), is used. In order to implement the PFT and the required QRNS overflow scaling units, a fast and compact distributed arithmetic filter (DAF) and number system converter is designed. The integrated system is developed and analyzed in the context of existing semiconductor technology. The resulting machine is shown to potentially possess megahertz-class performance, over a 16- to 24-bit data dynamic range, in a limited amount of hardware.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.57573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2085/00057573.pdf","startPage":"1386","endPage":"1394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.57573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An RNS discrete Fourier transform implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57573/","displayDocTitle":"An RNS discrete Fourier transform implementation","volume":"38","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758635","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An RNS discrete Fourier transform implementation","sourcePdf":"00057573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039849S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"11","articleId":"57573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57575,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By sampling the channel output faster than the training symbol rate and applying SVD to the data matrix formed from the observed data, the method is shown to exhibit improved-error performance over existing nonparametric LS methods and the parametric EF iterative algorithm. The RRLS algorithm's performance has been shown to be somewhat sensitive to model order selection and observation noise statistics. The normalized mean squared error (MSE) performance of the RRLS algorithm is shown to be essentially independent of oversampling factors that are not much greater than the span of the truncated channel.

The two methods developed assume knowledge of upper bounds on the ARMA orders. The first method performs a linear dependence search among the columns of a higher-order statistics matrix by means of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure. In the second method, the order of the AR part is found as the rank of the matrix formed by the higher-order statistics sequence. For numerically robust rank determination the singular value decomposition approach is adopted. The argument principle and samples of the polyspectral phase are used to obtain the relative degree of the ARMA model, from which the order of the MA part can be determined. Statistical analysis is included for determining the correct MA order with high probability, when estimates of third-order cumulants are only available. Simulations are used to verify the performance of the methods and compare autocorrelation with cumulant-based order determination approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2085/00057576.pdf","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.57576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.57576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2085","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cumulant-based order determination of non-Gaussian ARMA models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Higher order statistics","Phase estimation","Gaussian noise","Matrix decomposition","Signal processing","Phase noise","Gaussian processes","Upper bound","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","matrix algebra","spectral analysis","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonGaussian ARMA models","statistical analysis","simulations","nonminimum phase autoregressive moving average","higher-order cumulant statistics","upper bounds","linear dependence search","statistics matrix","Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization","rank determination","singular value decomposition","polyspectral phase","probability","autocorrelation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"Cumulant-based order determination of non-Gaussian ARMA models","volume":"38","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758638","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cumulant-based order determination of non-Gaussian ARMA models","sourcePdf":"00057576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079751S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"148","articleId":"57576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":57577,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.

Based on this architecture, a set of synchronization equations for configuring the entire oversampled system for arbitrary speed-accuracy specifications is presented. The generality and simplicity of the architecture allow the reduction of this procedure to running high-level, user-friendly software and programming PROMs (programmable read-only memories). The architecture was implemented in a 2.0- mu m N-well CMOS technology. Fabricated samples demonstrated the ability to handle many applications, including 16 b of SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) for the digital audio (20-kHz baseband) and 18 b of SNR for voiceband (4-kHz baseband). It is concluded that this DSP architecture is the most general and efficient computation engine for FIR/IIR (finite impulse response/infinite impulse response) filtering of 1-b signals. It is capable of over 30 MIPs. The architecture's simplicity and flexibility facilitate its interfacing with a high-level, user-friendly software package.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.57598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.57598","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2086/00057598.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A programmable demodulator for oversampled analog-to-digital modulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"A programmable demodulator for oversampled analog-to-digital modulators","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"37","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3758596","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57598/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A programmable demodulator for oversampled analog-to-digital modulators","sourcePdf":"00057598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038133S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"7","articleId":"57598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":57619,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Test data are developed for the program using actual values of input variables. When the program is executed, the program execution flow is monitored. If during program execution an undesirable execution flow is observed then function-minimization search algorithms are used to automatically locate the values of input variables for which the selected path is traversed. In addition, dynamic data-flow analysis is used to determine those input variables responsible for the undesirable program behavior, significantly increasing the speed of the search process. The approach to generating test data is then extended to programs with dynamic data structures and a search method based on dynamic data-flow analysis and backtracking is presented. In the approach described, values of array indexes and pointers are known at each step of program execution; this information is used to overcome difficulties of array and pointer handling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.57624","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00057624.png","startPage":"870","endPage":"879","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/2087/00057624.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.57624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated software test data generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic testing","Software testing","Data analysis","Input variables","Minimization methods","Costs","Monitoring","Automatic control","Data structures","Search methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic programming","data structures","minimisation","program testing","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated software test data generation","function-minimization methods","dynamic data-flow analysis","input variables","program execution flow","function-minimization search algorithms","input variables","program behavior","dynamic data structures","backtracking","array indexes","pointers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"Automated software test data generation","volume":"16","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3746825","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated software test data generation","sourcePdf":"00057624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03955S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"533","articleId":"57624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":57666,"authors":[{"name":"G.-S.J.

The approach is based on representing the constant acceleration translational motion and constant precession rotational motion in the form of a bilinear state-space model using standard rectilinear states for translation and quaternions for rotation. Closed-form solutions of the state transition equations are obtained to propagate the quaternions. The measurements are noisy perturbations of 3-D feature points represented in an inertial coordinate system. It is assumed that the 3-D feature points are extracted from the stereo images and matched over the frames. Owing to the nonlinearity in the state model, nonlinear filters are designed for the estimation of motion parameters. Simulation results are included. The Cramer-Rao performance bounds for motion parameter estimates are computed. A constructive proof for the uniqueness of motion parameters is given. It is shown that with uniform sampling in time, three noncollinear feature points in five consecutive binocular image pairs contain all the spatial and temporal information. Both nondegenerate and degenerate motions are analyzed. A deterministic algorithm to recover motion parameters from a stereo image sequence is summarized from the constructive proof.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D motion estimation using a sequence of noisy stereo images: models, estimation, and uniqueness results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.57666","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2090/00057666.pdf","startPage":"735","endPage":"759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.57666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"3-D motion estimation using a sequence of noisy stereo images: models, estimation, and uniqueness results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3746880","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D motion estimation using a sequence of noisy stereo images: models, estimation, and uniqueness results","sourcePdf":"00057666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099548S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"74","articleId":"57666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":57669,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

A k-TSSL is essentially defined by a finite set of substrings of length k that are permitted to appear in the strings of the language. Given a positive sample R of strings of an unknown language, a deterministic finite-state automation that recognizes the smallest k-TSSL containing R is obtained. The inferred automation is shown to have a number of transitions bounded by O(m) where m is the number of substrings defining this k-TSSL, and the inference algorithm works in O(kn log m) where n is the sum of the lengths of all the strings in R. The proposed methods are illustrated through syntactic pattern recognition experiments in which a number of strings generated by ten given (source) non-k-TSSL grammars are used to infer ten k-TSSL stochastic automata, which are further used to classify new strings generated by the same source grammars. The results of these experiments are consistent with the theory and show the ability of (stochastic) k-TSSLs to approach other classes of regular languages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.57687","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"920","endPage":"925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2091/00057687.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.57687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inference of k-testable languages in the strict sense and application to syntactic pattern recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Natural languages","Learning automata","Gold","Stochastic processes","Frequency","Terminology","Speech recognition","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","finite automata","formal languages","grammars","inference mechanisms","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k-testable languages","syntactic pattern recognition","inductive inference","strings","deterministic finite-state automation","inference algorithm","grammars"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Inference of k-testable languages in the strict sense and application to syntactic pattern recognition","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3746891","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57687/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inference of k-testable languages in the strict sense and application to syntactic pattern recognition","sourcePdf":"00057687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04353S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"120","articleId":"57687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":57695,"authors":[{"name":"E.C.

The two generic types of MB systems, broadcast and channel-probing systems, are explained. In systems using the broadcast protocol, the transmitter knows nothing about the occurrence of bursts or trails and transmits continuously for a sufficient duration to permit all recipients to receive the message/data with the desired probability. For practical purposes, the optimum burst or block duration for such systems is around 100-200 ms, based on the characteristics of the predominant trails. Channel-probing MB systems are more common and are commercially available in several versions. Here the transmitter repeatedly sends a short (typically 5-20 ms) probe signal until it receives a similarly short message response, indicating the availability of a suitable trail. A third, intermediate type of protocol with hybrid features does not probe the channel with a short signal, but starts repeatedly transmitting the first packet, in effect using it as a probe signal. Fundamental design issues and/or parameters of specific relevance to MB communication systems are discussed. Some historical and more recent MB systems are examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Radio communication","Context","Earth","Ionization","Scattering","Random media","Radio spectrum management","RF signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meteor burst communications","protocols","reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast systems","review","optimum burst duration","meteor burst communications","channel-probing systems","block duration","predominant trails","message response","protocol","probe signal"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.57696","startPage":"40","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/2092/00057696.pdf","doi":"10.1109/35.57696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meteor burst communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Meteor burst communications","accessionNumber":"3758667","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","volume":"28","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meteor burst communications","sourcePdf":"00057696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038057S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"21","articleId":"57696","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":57767,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

The technique assumes that the current distribution is confined to a single plane. The data it requires are measurements of the magnetic flux on a plane. These can be provided by an integrated planar array of superconducting quantum interference device magnetometers. The approach is based on the magnetic lead field which is derived in a simple way based on energy concepts. Using the lead field and conservation of charge conditions provides two linear, spatially invariant imaging equations relating the current density and flux measurements. These equations are solved using Fourier techniques. The validity of the resulting reconstruction technique is shown both analytically and with a computer model. The effects of not satisfying the planar assumption are described for the case where the currents are parallel but not in the same plane.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3756686","pubMedId":"18222776","displayDocTitle":"Biomagnetic Fourier imaging (current density reconstruction)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biomagnetic Fourier imaging (current density reconstruction)","sourcePdf":"00057767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025834S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"11","articleId":"57767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":57768,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Given three-dimensional image data as a stack of slices, it can extract brain parenchyma, cerebro-spinal fluid, and high-intensity abnormalities. The multiple feature environment of MR imaging is used to comput several low-level features to enhance the separability of voxels of different structures. The population distribution of each feature is considered and a confidence function is computed whose amplitude indicates the likelihood of a voxel, with a given feature value, being a member of a class of voxels. Confidence levels are divided into a set of ranges to define notions such as highly confident, moderately confident, and least confident. The rule-based system consists of a set of sequential stages in which partially segmented binary scenes of one stage guide the next stage. Some important low-level definitions and rules for a clinical imaging protocol are presented. The system is applied to several MR images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.57771","startPage":"327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/2096/00057771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.57771","endPage":"337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-level segmentation of 3-D magnetic resonance brain images-a rule-based system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Low-level segmentation of 3-D magnetic resonance brain images-a rule-based system","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3766963","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","pubMedId":"18222780","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-level segmentation of 3-D magnetic resonance brain images-a rule-based system","sourcePdf":"00057771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053257S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"110","articleId":"57771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57798,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

Control information is sent over a dedicated signaling channel and data are sent over channels owned by the transmitters. Time is divided into slots on each channel and slots on the control channel are further split into mini-slots. Fixed time-division multiaccess (TDM) is used within each slot on the control channel. Transmitters indicate their intention to transmit a packet by transmitting the destination address during their appropriate mini-slot in the control channel and then transmit their packet in the next slot on their data channel. Receivers listen to the control channel and tune to the appropriate channel to receive packets addressed to them. A common but distributed arbitration algorithm is used to resolve conflicts when packets from many transmitters contend for the same receiver. Each receiver executes the same deterministic algorithm to choose one of the contending packets. Each transmitter uses the same algorithm to determine the success or failure of its packet.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3756817","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A media-access protocol for packet-switched wavelength division multiaccess metropolitan area networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A media-access protocol for packet-switched wavelength division multiaccess metropolitan area networks","sourcePdf":"00057808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03454S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"196","articleId":"57808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":57810,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The applicability of the dispersion-shifted (DS) and nondispersion-shifted (NDS) fibers is discussed, taking account of channel frequency separation, total channel numbers, input signal power, transmission length, and receiver sensitivity degradation. Experimental results on Brillouin gain spectra and the wave generation efficiency in four-wave mixing processes are also presented to discuss the applicability of the two types of single-node fiber. It was found that NDS fibers operated at a wavelength of 1550 nm can be widely deployed in multichannel systems both for the long-haul and information distribution transmissions, if the signal waveform distortion due to fiber chromatic dispersion is precluded. The delay equalizer will be useful for a high-speed system employing bit rates over 10 Gb/s and repeaterless spans over 300 km. For such an application, DS fiber is preferable. Concerning information distribution network applications, the NDS fiber should be more attractive as a transmission medium for FDM system applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission limitations due to fiber nonlinearities in optical FDM systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.57810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2098/00057810.pdf","startPage":"1068","endPage":"1077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.57810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=57810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57810/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"Transmission limitations due to fiber nonlinearities in optical FDM systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3756819","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission limitations due to fiber nonlinearities in optical FDM systems","sourcePdf":"00057810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069512S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"49","articleId":"57810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":57813,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

WDM switching systems are proposed as an application of this AO switch, and optical insertion loss, crosstalk, and optical frequency shift are discussed. Wavelength-selective characteristics in the AO module are established. The crosstalk from other wavelengths is found to be reduced by decreasing slightly the switching transfer efficiency.

Both laser configurations are capable of being continuously tuned over several nanometers. The practically useful tuning range strongly depends on structure geometry parameters and is limited by either the required amplification or the tuning densities. It is shown that, with comparable parameters, the useful continuous tuning range of the TTG-DFB laser is 30% larger than that of the 3S-DBR laser.

Both tunable transmitters and tunable filters are considered. The dependence of the refractive index on the carrier density in semiconductors is exploited to obtain fast wavelength tuning. Experimentally, switching times of <15 ns have been demonstrated in a three-section distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser transmitter with a maximum continuous tuning range of 2.2 nm. These conditions correspond to a system with 50 wavelength-addressable channels. A new scheme for simultaneous wavelength-switching and data modulation, which alleviates wavelength drifts due to thermal effects, is presented. Distributed feedback (DFB) laser structures biased below the lasing threshold operate as resonant tunable amplifiers. A uniform DFB laser amplifier has been demonstrated with a 1 ns wavelength-switching time. Experiments with tunable transmitters and tunable filters that simulate their operation in packet switching systems including both wavelength-switching and data modulation, are also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3756835","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast wavelength-switching of laser transmitters and amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast wavelength-switching of laser transmitters and amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00057826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051663S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"59","articleId":"57826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":57833,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Charge pumping (CP) is a technique for studying traps at the Si-SiO/sub 2/ interface in MOS transistors. In the CP technique, a pulse is applied to the gate of the MOSFET which alternately fills the traps with electrons and holes, thereby causing a recombination current I/sub cp/ to flow in the substrate. With this technique, interface trap capture cross sections for both electrons and holes may be determined as a function of trap energy in a single device. It is demonstrated that a modified three-level charge pumping method may be used to determine not only interface trap densities but also to capture cross sections as a function of trap energy.

The sinusoidal waveform case is surveyed, viewing the active current as a component of identical waveform with the voltage. This approach, when extended to nonsinusoidal waveforms, supports Fryze's model for apparent power, S/sup 2/=p/sup 2/+Q/sup 2//sub F/. It is proved that the total reactive power Q/sub F/ is composed from four distinctive types of elementary reactive powers. Each of the basic reactive powers is identified as the amplitude of an oscillation of instantaneous power. The separation of Q/sub F/ in Q/sub 1/, the reactive power at the system frequency, and in Q/sub H/, the reactive power at harmonic frequencies, is recommended as an effective mean for monitoring filter efficacy and power-factor compensation. Two major recommendations are supported by the results of this study: abolish the power model using distortion power, and measure the active power of the system frequency separately from the active power of the harmonics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.57980","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/2105/00057980.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.57980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Powers in nonsinusoidal situations-a review of definitions and physical meaning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Frequency","Power harmonic filters","Power system harmonics","Voltage","Monitoring","Active filters","Power system modeling","Harmonic distortion","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","harmonics","power factor","power systems","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","nonsinusoidal situations","reactive power","waveform","active current","Fryze's model","apparent power","oscillation","instantaneous power","harmonic frequencies","filter efficacy","power-factor compensation","distortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/57980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Powers in nonsinusoidal situations-a review of definitions and physical meaning","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3770615","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Powers in nonsinusoidal situations-a review of definitions and physical meaning","sourcePdf":"00057980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058222S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"211","articleId":"57980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":57981,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This solution algorithm allows the designer to obtain a desirable, global noninferior point in a reasonable computation time. Also, given a desired number of switch-on/switch-off operations involved in the network configuration, the solution algorithm can identify the most effective operations. In order to reduce the computation time required, the idea of approximate calculations is explored and incorporated into the solution algorithm, where two efficient load-flow methods are employed; one for high temperature and the other for low temperature. The solution algorithm has been implemented in a software package and tested on a 69-bus system with very promising results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.58002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/2105/00058002.pdf","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.58002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal network reconfigurations in distribution systems.

The goals of the Blanca network research program are to develop technologies supporting gigabit/second networks, to develop programming tools supporting advanced network-based applications, and to explore the relationships between network technology paradigms and application requirements. The intent of the Casa testbed is to demonstrate that distributed supercomputing using wide-area high-speed networks can provide new levels of computational resources for leading-edge scientific problems. For the Nectar testbed project, a gigabit/second or higher experimental network will be developed to connect a variety of high-performance hosts.

It is found that the behavior of the propagation delay of XOR gates is quite linear, and this allows the derivation of a propagation delay expression for XOR gates using a sensitivity analysis. The validity of the expression is checked by comparison with SPICE simulations and with results from the literature, and agreement to 10% is obtained. It has been found that this expression can be used to accurately predict the maximum toggle frequency of frequency dividers. Using this expression, it has also been verified that the maximum toggle frequency of regenerative frequency dividers is about twice as high as that of static frequency dividers. In order to optimize frequency dividers, figures of merit for frequency dividers realized in silicon and AlGaAs-GaAs technologies are proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.58284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.58284","startPage":"920","endPage":"931","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2113/00058284.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical maximum toggle frequency expression and its application to optimizing high-speed ECL frequency dividers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"An analytical maximum toggle frequency expression and its application to optimizing high-speed ECL frequency dividers","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3780944","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58284/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical maximum toggle frequency expression and its application to optimizing high-speed ECL frequency dividers","sourcePdf":"00058284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085171S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"35","articleId":"58284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":58291,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is convenient to track the left singular vectors associated with the largest singular values of the triangular factor, L(t), of its Cholesky factorization. These algorithms are referred to as square-root. The drawback of the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) or the singular value decompositions (SVD) is usually the volume of the computations. Various numerical methods for carrying out this task are surveyed, and it is shown why this heavy computational burden is questionable in numerous situations and should be revised. Indeed, the complexity per eigenpair is generally a quadratic function of the problem size, but there exist faster algorithms with linear complexity. Finally, in order to make a choice among the large and fuzzy set of available techniques, comparisons based on computer simulations in a relevant signal processing context are made.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2114","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2114/00058320.pdf","doi":"10.1109/5.58320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58320","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking a few extreme singular values and vectors in signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58320/","displayDocTitle":"Tracking a few extreme singular values and vectors in signal processing","isJournal":true,"volume":"78","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"3785290","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking a few extreme singular values and vectors in signal processing","sourcePdf":"00058320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059755S","chronDate":"Aug.  1990","isNumber":"2114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"354","articleId":"58320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58322,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The concept underlying these iterative adaptation algorithms is the minimal disturbance principle, which suggests that during training it is advisable to inject new information into a network in a manner that disturbs stored information to the smallest extent possible. The two principal kinds of online rules that have developed for altering the weights of a network are examined for both single-threshold elements and multielement networks. They are error-correction rules, which alter the weights of a network to correct error in the output response to the present input pattern, and gradient rules, which alter the weights of a network during each pattern presentation by gradient descent with the objective of reducing mean-square error (averaged over all training patterns).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","volume":"78","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"3796897","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"30 years of adaptive neural networks: perceptron, Madaline, and backpropagation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"30 years of adaptive neural networks: perceptron, Madaline, and backpropagation","sourcePdf":"00058323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103845S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1454","articleId":"58323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":58324,"authors":[{"name":"S.-i.

Three examples of synthetic neural modeling are discussed. Darwin I was designed to examine the process of pattern recognition and some general factors relating to degeneracy and amplification in selective systems. Darwin II introduced recognition units with some of the properties of neuronal groups, connected in reentrant networks to permit exploration of aspects of the recognition process leading to categorization, generalization, and associative memory. Darwin III is a behaving automation whose behavior is not programmed but results from its encounter with events in its world under constraints of neuronal and synaptic selection. The oculomotor, reaching, touch, and categorization subsystems of the Darwin-III system are discussed. Darwin III is compared to models based on neurobiology, models based on artificial intelligence, and connectionist models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.58327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58327","endPage":"1530","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2115/00058327.pdf","startPage":"1498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthetic neural modeling: the 'Darwin' series of recognition automata","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58327/","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic neural modeling: the 'Darwin' series of recognition automata","volume":"78","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"3796901","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic neural modeling: the 'Darwin' series of recognition automata","sourcePdf":"00058327.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04969S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"69","articleId":"58327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":58328,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The model appears to represent a fundamental neural mechanism of force control because both firing rates and forces calculated from the model agree with experimental data in humans and monkeys.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.58328","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2115/00058328.pdf","startPage":"1531","endPage":"1535","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network model for control of muscle force based on the size principle of motor unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Neural network model for control of muscle force based on the size principle of motor unit","volume":"78","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3796902","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network model for control of muscle force based on the size principle of motor unit","sourcePdf":"00058328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028499S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"16","articleId":"58328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":58329,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Short-term memory (STM) is modeled by units comprised of recurrent excitatory connections between two neurons. A dual-neuron model is proposed. By applying the Hebbian learning rule at each synapse and a normalization rule among all synaptic weights of a neuron, it is shown that a quantity called the input potential increases monotonically with sequence presentation, and that the neuron can only be fired when its input signals are arranged in a specific sequence. These sequence-detecting neurons form the basis for a model of complex sequence recognition that can tolerate distortions of the learned sequences. A recurrent network of two layers is provided for reproducing complex sequences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.58329","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1543","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2115","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2115/00058329.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex temporal sequence learning based on short-term memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58329/","displayDocTitle":"Complex temporal sequence learning based on short-term memory","volume":"78","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3796903","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex temporal sequence learning based on short-term memory","sourcePdf":"00058329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046505S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"79","articleId":"58329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":58337,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Learning in layered networks is posed as a search in the network parameter space for a network that minimizes an additive error function of a statistically independent examples. By imposing the equivalence of the minimum error and the maximum likelihood criteria for training the network, the Gibbs distribution on the ensemble of networks with a fixed architecture is derived. The probability of correct prediction of a novel example can be expressed using the ensemble, serving as a measure to the network's generalization ability. The entropy of the prediction distribution is shown to be a consistent measure of the network's performance. The proposed formalism is applied to the problems of selecting an optimal architecture and the prediction of learning curves.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.58339","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1574","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2116","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2116/00058339.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A statistical approach to learning and generalization in layered neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58339/","displayDocTitle":"A statistical approach to learning and generalization in layered neural networks","volume":"78","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3796885","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical approach to learning and generalization in layered neural networks","sourcePdf":"00058339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054788S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"147","articleId":"58339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":58340,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The convergence properties of the Hopfield model are dependent on the structure of the interconnections matrix W and the method by which the nodes are updated. Three cases are known: (1) convergence to a stable state when operating in a serial mode with symmetric W; (2) convergence to a cycle of length 2, at most, when operating in a fully parallel mode with symmetric W; and (3) convergence to a cycle of length 4 when operating in a fully parallel mode with antisymmetric W. The three known results are reviewed and it is proven that the fully parallel mode of operation is a special case of the serial model of operation. There are three more cases than can be considered using this characterization: serial mode of operation, antisymmetric W; serial mode of operation, arbitrary W; and fully parallel mode of operation, arbitrary W. By exhibiting exponential lower bounds on the length of the cycles in other cases, it is proven that the three known cases are the only interesting ones.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","volume":"78","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3796887","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"On the convergence properties of the Hopfield model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the convergence properties of the Hopfield model","sourcePdf":"00058341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041427S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"79","articleId":"58341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58342,"authors":[{"name":"L.K.

The number of terms in the linear combination is minimal for first-order terms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.58342","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2116/00058342.pdf","startPage":"1586","endPage":"1589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructive approximations for neural networks by sigmoidal functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58342","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58342/","displayDocTitle":"Constructive approximations for neural networks by sigmoidal functions","volume":"78","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3796888","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructive approximations for neural networks by sigmoidal functions","sourcePdf":"00058342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031312S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"93","articleId":"58342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58344,"authors":[{"name":"O.J.

This neural network is of interest because it is designed specifically for the set of training patterns, and incorporating of the training of the network into the design eliminates the need for the use of training algorithms. The technique therefore provides an alternative to the limitations and unpredictability (such as having too many, too few, or inappropriate training patterns) of the known training techniques. Since the nearest-neighbor classification rule is used, the network is capable of forming arbitrarily complex decision regions. The design and training of the network can be completed in polynomial time, whereas it has been shown that training a neural network is an NP-complete problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2116/00058344.pdf","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1598","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.58344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nearest neighbor pattern classification perceptrons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nearest neighbor searches","Pattern classification","Neural networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Polynomials","Computer networks","Multi-layer neural network","Multilayer perceptrons","Process design","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-layer perceptron","nearest-neighbor pattern classification rule","neural network","training patterns","decision regions","polynomial time","NP-complete problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Nearest neighbor pattern classification perceptrons","volume":"78","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3796890","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nearest neighbor pattern classification perceptrons","sourcePdf":"00058344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04824S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"48","articleId":"58344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":58346,"authors":[{"name":"I.K.

A number of empirical tests on three real-world problems in power-system load forecasting, power-system security prediction, and speaker-independent vowel recognition are presented. The load-forecasting problem, which is partially a regression problem, uses past trends to predict the critical needs of future power generation. The power-security problem uses the classifier as an interpolator of previously known states of the system. The vowel-recognition problem is representative of the difficulties in automatic speech recognition caused by variability across speakers and phonetic context. In all cases even with various sizes of training sets, the multilayer perceptron performed as well as or better than the trained classification trees. It is therefore concluded that there is not enough theoretical basis to demonstrate clear-cut superiority of one technique over the other.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance comparison of trained multilayer perceptrons and trained classification trees","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.58347","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2116/00058347.pdf","startPage":"1614","endPage":"1619","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00058347.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58347","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58347/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","displayDocTitle":"A performance comparison of trained multilayer perceptrons and trained classification trees","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"78","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3796893","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance comparison of trained multilayer perceptrons and trained classification trees","sourcePdf":"00058347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056597S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"83","articleId":"58347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":58349,"authors":[{"name":"B.P.

This advantage can be attributed principally to the use of elementary physical phenomena as computational primitives, and to the representation of information by the relative values of analog signals rather than by the absolute values of digital signals. This approach requires adaptive techniques to mitigate the effects of component differences. This kind of adaptation leads naturally to systems that learn about their environment. Large-scale adaptive analog systems are more robust to component degradation and failure than are more conventional systems, and they use far less power. For this reason, adaptive analog technology can be expected to utilize the full potential of wafer-scale silicon fabrication.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.58356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58356","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1636","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2116/00058356.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic electronic systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic electronic systems","volume":"78","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3807284","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic electronic systems","sourcePdf":"00058356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058675S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1024","articleId":"58356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":58357,"authors":[{"name":"K.-Y.

The neural network used is an energy-minimizing network. The limiting process contains the state vector within a set of limits, and this model is called the brain state in a box, or BSB model, which forms energy minima (attractors in the network dynamical system) based on learned input data. The system first determines how many emitters are present (the deinterleaving problem). Pulses from individual simulated emitters give rise to separate stable attractors in the network. Once individual emitters are characterized, it is possible to tentatively identify them based on their observed parameters. As a test of this idea, a neural network was used to form a small database that could potentially make emitter identification. There were three errors of classification. The number of iterations are required to reach an attractor state was very long, and some of the final states were not fully limited. These factors indicate the uncertainty of the neural network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.58358","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2116/00058358.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.58358","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1646","endPage":"1657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar signal categorization using a neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58358","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Radar signal categorization using a neural network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58358/","volume":"78","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3807286","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar signal categorization using a neural network","sourcePdf":"00058358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043537S","chronDate":"Oct.  1990","isNumber":"2116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"58","articleId":"58358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":58386,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The two main spread-spectrum techniques, direct sequence and frequency hopping, are explained. In frequency hopping, the transmitter repeatedly changes (hops) the carrier frequency from one frequency to another. Direct-sequence transmission spreads the spectrum not by periodically changing the frequency but by modulating the original (information) baseband signal with a very wide-baseband digital signal. The wideband modulating signal's amplitude changes continually between two states, high and low, arbitrarily called +1 and -1, respectively, with the sequence of highs and lows being pseudorandom. Applying spread spectrum to code-division multiaccess (CDMA) communication, in which each user is assigned an identification code (a distinct sequence of frequencies for frequency hopping or +1 s and -1 s for direct-sequence modulation) is discussed. The use of CDMA for cellular radio, where it promises a capacity of over 1000 users per cell, by the authors' calculations, is considered. The potential of spread spectrum for relieving spectrum congestion is addressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/6.58433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel3/6/2121/00058433.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.58433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2121","startPage":"40","endPage":"41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread spectrum goes commercial","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58433","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spread spectrum goes commercial","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3758334","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread spectrum goes commercial","sourcePdf":"00058433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033254S","chronDate":"Aug.  1990","isNumber":"2121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"39","articleId":"58433","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58452,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The sampling process used by these oscilloscopes is essentially a brief switch closure of a few picoseconds between the signal to be measured at the oscilloscope input and a holding capacitor in the detection circuit. During this switch closure, sampling current flows from the input and is collected or integrated in a capacitor into a finite charge proportional to the input signal. The collected charge is then measured with an analog-to-digital converter. The sudden flow of sampling current during the switch closure creates an impulselike electric disturbance at the oscilloscope input. The characterization technique exploits the fact that this kickback response is a signature of the sampling process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscilloscopes","Switches","Signal sampling","Pulse measurements","Integrated circuit measurements","Instruments","Switching circuits","Signal processing","Switched capacitor circuits","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","oscilloscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed oscilloscopes","sampling process","switch closure","holding capacitor","detection circuit","sampling current","finite charge","analog-to-digital converter","electric disturbance","kickback response"]}],"doi":"10.1109/6.58452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel3/6/2122/00058452.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.58452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing high-speed oscilloscopes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58452","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing high-speed oscilloscopes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58452/","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3758341","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing high-speed oscilloscopes","sourcePdf":"00058452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02063S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"37","articleId":"58452","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":58455,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

If the system is not excessively unstable, feedback strategies that bring closed-loop trajectories arbitrarily close to zero for a long time can be implemented.

The main feature is the freedom to achieve important objectives such as structure assignment, decoupling, and desired transient behavior, as well as reference matching, optimal control, or disturbance rejection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3768532","volume":"35","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Block multirate input-output model for sampled-data control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block multirate input-output model for sampled-data control systems","sourcePdf":"00058545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030486S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"84","articleId":"58545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":58555,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Ramadge and W.M. Wonham (SIAM J. Cont. Optimiz., vol.25, no.1, p.206-30, 1987). The setup embodies a low-level real-world model controlled by an operator and a high-level abstract model virtually controlled by a manager. The two levels are connected by command and information channels. Concepts of hierarchical consistency are proposed, relating high-level behavior required by the manager to low-level behavior achievable by the operator. It is shown that consistency can be realized by appropriately refining the information sent up by the operator to the manager.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.58555","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1125","endPage":"1134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2126/00058555.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.58555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the consistency of hierarchical supervision in discrete-event systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete event systems","Control systems","Automatic control","Automata","Supervisory control","Information processing","Mathematical programming","Optimal control","Robot control","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automata theory","discrete time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical supervision","discrete-event systems","supervisory control","automaton framework","real-world model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"On the consistency of hierarchical supervision in discrete-event systems","volume":"35","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3792702","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58555/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the consistency of hierarchical supervision in discrete-event systems","sourcePdf":"00058555.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03952S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"171","articleId":"58555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":58592,"authors":[{"name":"C.P.

Classified VQ (CVQ) of the m-AZTEC output is next performed to exploit the correlation in the other AZTEC parameter, namely, the value parameter. CVQ preserves the waveform morphology by treating the lines and slopes as two perceptually distinct classes.

It is based on hidden Markov modeling (HMM), a technique successfully used since the mid 1970s to model speech waveforms for automatic speech recognition. Many ventricular arrhythmias can be classified by detecting and analyzing QRS complexes and determining R-R intervals. Classification of supraventricular arrhythmias, however, often requires detection of the P wave in addition to the QRS complex. The HMM approach combines structural and statistical knowledge of the ECG signal in a single parametric model. Model parameters are estimated from training data using an iterative, maximum-likelihood reestimation algorithm. Initial results suggest that this approach can provide improved supraventricular arrhythmia analysis through accurate representation of the entire beat, including the P-wave.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.58593","startPage":"826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2128/00058593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.58593","endPage":"836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to cardiac arrhythmia analysis using hidden Markov models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"An approach to cardiac arrhythmia analysis using hidden Markov models","volume":"37","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3781051","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","pubMedId":"2227969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to cardiac arrhythmia analysis using hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00058593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03724S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"311","articleId":"58593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":58594,"authors":[{"name":"N.V.

The algorithm first generates a binary sequence by comparing the signal to a threshold. The probability distribution of the time intervals of the binary sequence is obtained, and the sequential hypothesis testing procedure of A.J. Wald and J. Wolfowitz (1948) is employed to discriminate the arrhythmias. Sequential hypothesis testing of 85 cases resulted in identification of (1) 97.64% VF and 97.65% VT episodes after 5 s and (2) 100% identification of both VF and VT after 7 s. The desired false positive and false negative error probabilities can be programmed into the algorithm. An important feature of the sequential method is that extra time for detection can be traded off for improved accuracy, and vice versa.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.58594","startPage":"837","endPage":"843","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2128/00058594.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.58594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation detection by a sequential hypothesis testing algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fibrillation","Sequential analysis","Electric shock","Heart","Rhythm","Error probability","Cardiology","Autocorrelation","Robustness","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algorithm theory","cardiology","electrocardiography","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG signal","sequential hypothesis testing algorithm","algorithm","ventricular fibrillation","ventricular tachycardia","binary sequence","arrhythmias","5 s","7 s"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electrocardiography","Humans","Predictive Value of Tests","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Tachycardia","Ventricular Fibrillation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation detection by a sequential hypothesis testing algorithm","volume":"37","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3792727","pubMedId":"2227970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation detection by a sequential hypothesis testing algorithm","sourcePdf":"00058594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04231S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"186","articleId":"58594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":58597,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

In contrast with single-fiber models, the bundle model reveals that the shape of the action potential is influenced by tissue resistivities. In addition, the steady-state activation wavefront through the cross section perpendicular to the long axis of the bundle is not planar and propagates with a velocity that lies between that of a single fiber in an unbounded volume and a single-fiber in a restricted extracellular space.

A combination of dynamic programming and an open-loop, trial-and-error adjustment process was used to find a suboptimal set of discretely varying muscle stimulation patterns needed for a 3-D, 8 degree-of-freedom dynamic model to sustain a step. An ankle-foot orthosis was found to be especially useful, as it helped to stabilize the stance leg and simplified the task of controlling the foot during swing. It is believed that the process of simulating natural gait with this model will serve to highlight difficulties to be expected during laboratory and clinical trials.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.58599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"886","endPage":"902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2128/00058599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.58599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoring unassisted natural gait to paraplegics via functional neuromuscular stimulation: a computer simulation study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neuromuscular stimulation","Muscles","Fatigue","Force control","Computer simulation","Extremities","Leg","Dynamic programming","Communication system control","Spinal cord"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","medical computing","muscle","neurophysiology","orthotics","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unassisted natural gait restoration","open-loop trial-and-error adjustment","musculoskeletal model","paraplegics","functional neuromuscular stimulation","computer simulation study","electrically stimulated ankle plantarflexors","dynamic programming","discretely varying muscle stimulation patterns","8 degree-of-freedom dynamic model","ankle-foot orthosis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Electric Stimulation Therapy","Feasibility Studies","Gait","Humans","Models, Biological","Movement","Muscles","Paraplegia","Tendons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Restoring unassisted natural gait to paraplegics via functional neuromuscular stimulation: a computer simulation study","volume":"37","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3792729","pubMedId":"2227975","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58599/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoring unassisted natural gait to paraplegics via functional neuromuscular stimulation: a computer simulation study","sourcePdf":"00058599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106431S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"207","articleId":"58599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58611,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the experiments, the frequency response measurements are taken at spatially distributed locations throughout the test area by fixing the receiver in a central location and moving the transmitter to different locations. The experiments are performed in a high-rise office building and a three-story building with offices and laboratories. For each experiment, the exponent of the power-distance relationship and the statistics of the 3-dB width of the frequency correlation function are determined from the frequency-domain data. The approximation to the impulse response of the channel is obtained from the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency response.

As with the method based on the Lagrangian approximation, spurious solutions are eliminated when the divergence-free constraint is satisfied and the boundary conditions are explicitly enforced. However, the smooth (C/sup 1/) Hermitian approximation allows the direct elimination of the axial field component in each triangle element. This procedure results in a reduction of the computer memory needed and in programming efficiency. As the Hermitian FEM uses smooth basis functions, the method also increases the quality of the field solutions. The method has been applied to mode characterization in waveguides. Several comparisons with Lagrangian FEM demonstrate the advantages of the Hermitian FEM. Some difficulties arising in cases of waveguides with sharp edges are discussed.

Numerical results show that the asymptotic boundary conditions yield more accurate results than those obtainable with a perfectly conducting shield placed at the same location.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.58681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2131/00058681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.58681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2131","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic boundary conditions for finite element analysis of three-dimensional transmission line discontinuities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic boundary conditions for finite element analysis of three-dimensional transmission line discontinuities","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3781027","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic boundary conditions for finite element analysis of three-dimensional transmission line discontinuities","sourcePdf":"00058681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044967S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"30","articleId":"58681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58686,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The formulation permits numerous inhomogeneous waveguide structures of arbitrary linear composition, including chiral media, to be analyzed without any nonphysical, spurious modes. In the proposed formulation both the necessary conditions on the tangential field components and the additional conditions on the normal field components are automatically satisfied by the trial functions. In this way the dimension of the resulting sparse generalized eigenvalue problem is significantly reduced. The straightforward extension to the novel class of chirowaveguides, which exhibit a number of interesting new features, demonstrates the versatility of the formulation. The advantageous numerical properties are thus preserved. Numerical examples on both metal and dielectric chirowaveguides are given. The finite-element results are compared with exact solutions, and the correspondence is found to be excellent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.58690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2131/00058690.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.58690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation analysis of chirowaveguides using the finite-element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58690/","displayDocTitle":"Propagation analysis of chirowaveguides using the finite-element method","volume":"38","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3781036","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation analysis of chirowaveguides using the finite-element method","sourcePdf":"00058690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067712S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"95","articleId":"58690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58698,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Even after discounting systematic underreporting of operations and environmental outages, the conclusion is clear: hardware faults and hardware maintenance are no longer a major source of outages. As the other components of the system become increasingly reliable, software necessarily becomes the dominant cause of outages.

The authors present the results of an analysis that demonstrates that the log is composed of at least two error processes: transient and intermittent. The mixing of data from multiple processes requires many more events to verify a hypotheses using traditional statistical analysis. Based on the shape of the interarrival time function of the intermittent errors observed from actual error logs, a failure-prediction heuristic, the dispersion frame technique (DFT), is developed. The DFT was implemented in a distributed system for the campus-wide Andrew file system at Carnegie Mellon University. Data collected from 13 file servers over a 22-month period were analyzed using both the DFT and conventional statistical methods. It is shown that the DFT can extract intermittent errors from the error log and uses only one fifth of the error-log entry points required by statistical methods for failure prediction. The DFT achieved a 93.7% success rate in predicting failures in both electromechanical and electronic devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58720/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","volume":"39","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3803743","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error log analysis: statistical modeling and heuristic trend analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error log analysis: statistical modeling and heuristic trend analysis","sourcePdf":"00058720.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024802S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"115","articleId":"58720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":58721,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

In accordance with empirically based expectations, operating behaviors of networks (and other devices) can be classified as being either normal or anomalous. Because network failures most frequently manifest themselves as performance degradations or deviations from expected behavior, periods of anomalous performance can be attributed to causes assignable as network faults. The half-year case study presented used a system in which observations of distributed-computing network behavior were automatically and systematically classified as normal or anomalous. Anomalous behaviors were traced to faulty conditions. In a preliminary effort to understand and catalog how networks behave under various conditions, two cases of anomalous behavior are analyzed in detail.

They introduce the projection-minimization (P-M) algorithm and demonstrate that, under favorable conditions, its performance, even when not acceptable on its own, could possibly be beneficial when used in conjunction with the LS decoder in enhancing the reliability of the channel. Implementation of the P-M decoder is rather expensive, and it is not at all clear that combining the P-M algorithm with LS decoding and traditional error control schemes is the best way of dealing with channels corrupted by jitter. It may be possible to avoid the P-M algorithm and instead utilize a more aggressive traditional error correction scheme. Alternatively, it may be possible to choose modulation schemes which utilize pulses whose derivatives at the sampled values are small, and perhaps obtain better results than with partial-response class-IV signaling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3781260","volume":"38","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sequence estimation for class-IV partial-response channels with jitter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence estimation for class-IV partial-response channels with jitter","sourcePdf":"00058751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","articleId":"58751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":58753,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The effect of various stochastic models for the carrier phase is examined in detail, while no epoch or frequency uncertainty is assumed. The delay-and-multiply type of detector is considered. A new binary/quadrature phase shift keying (BPSK/QPSK) classifier is compared to the more traditional ad hoc techniques of a square-law classifier and a phase-based classifier (weighting on the phase histogram). The new classifier is derived by approximating the likelihood-ratio functionals of phase-modulated digital signals in white Gaussian noise, hence is named the quasi-log-likelihood ratio (qLLR) rule. It is shown analytically that its performance is significantly better than that of intuitively designed phase-based rules or the conventional square-law classifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2134/00058753.pdf","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.58753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.58753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the detection and classification of quadrature digital modulations in broad-band noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Digital modulation","Stochastic resonance","Frequency","Uncertainty","Delay","Detectors","Binary phase shift keying","Histograms","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signals","interference (signal)","modulation","phase shift keying","signal detection","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant envelope modulation","signal detection","optimal decision rules","delay-and-multiply type detector","classification","quadrature digital modulations","suboptimal decision rules","broadband noise","stochastic models","carrier phase","phase shift keying","BPSK/QPSK","square-law classifier","phase-based classifier","likelihood-ratio functionals","phase-modulated digital signals","white Gaussian noise","quasi-log-likelihood ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"On the detection and classification of quadrature digital modulations in broad-band noise","volume":"38","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3781262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the detection and classification of quadrature digital modulations in broad-band noise","sourcePdf":"00058753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02748S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"166","articleId":"58753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58754,"authors":[{"name":"K.-I.

With this method, an image is divided into bit planes that are transformed into a binary tree representation in which initial identical portions of different lines in the bit planes are transmitted as one path in the tree. To increase compression, distortion can be introduced by considering two lines which differ in fewer that a preset number of bit positions to be identical. A time efficient method of implementing BTO based on a communication technique called content-induced transaction overlap is outlined. With this technique, only simple, logical operations are needed and the compression time is proportional to the number of bits in the compressed image. Simulation studies indicate that BTO produces good quality images with a compression ratio of about three. In terms of implementation and compression efficiencies, BTO is comparable to first-order DPCM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3781268","volume":"38","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The compression effects of the binary tree overlapping method on digital imagery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The compression effects of the binary tree overlapping method on digital imagery","sourcePdf":"00058759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098113S","chronDate":"Aug.  1990","isNumber":"2134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"58759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":58761,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The vision of the third generation is a single set of standards that can meet a wide range of wireless access applications. Third-generation systems, in harmony with broadband integrated services digital networks, will use shared resources to convey many information types. A single network architecture will serve its users efficiently in many environments, including moving vehicles, indoor and outdoor public areas, residences, offices, and factories. A study of a switching architecture, referred to as a cellular packet switch, and a packet transmission technique, referred to as a packet reservation multiple access is discussed. By means of a design example, it is shown how these techniques can work together to meet some of the demands of third-generation systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2134/00058761.pdf","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.58761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.58761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular packet communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telephony","ISDN","Mobile communication","Packet switching","Switches","Land mobile radio","Speech","Vehicles","Production facilities","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","digital radio systems","multi-access systems","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular packet communications","wireless networking","switching architecture","cellular packet switch","packet transmission technique","packet reservation multiple access","third-generation systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","displayDocTitle":"Cellular packet communications","volume":"38","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","accessionNumber":"3781270","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular packet communications","sourcePdf":"00058761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044078S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"287","articleId":"58761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":58762,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Eckhardt and L.D. Lee (1985), shows that independently developed program versions fail dependently. The authors show that there is a precise duality between input choice and program choice in this model and consider a generalization in which different versions can be developed using diverse methodologies. The use of diverse methodologies is shown to decrease the probability of the simultaneous failure of several versions. Indeed, it is theoretically possible to obtain versions which exhibit better than independent failure behavior. The authors formalize the notion of methodological diversity by considering the sequence of decision outcomes that constitute a methodology. They show that diversity of decision implies likely diversity of behavior for the different versions developed under such forced diversity. For certain one-out-of-n systems the authors obtain an optimal method for allocating diversity between versions. For two-out-of-three systems there seem to be no simple optimality results which do not depend on constraints which cannot be verified in practice.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.58771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/2135/00058771.pdf","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.58771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=58771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conceptual modeling of coincident failures in multiversion software","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Conceptual modeling of coincident failures in multiversion software","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","volume":"15","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3594580","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conceptual modeling of coincident failures in multiversion software","sourcePdf":"00058771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025705S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"2135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"161","articleId":"58771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":58871,"authors":[{"name":"L.K.

Comparisons between radiosondes and the SSM/I are presented for three different algorithms. The results show the possibility of a distinct improvement in the retrieval of total precipitable water over the ocean. The global, nonlinear algorithm is more sensitive to cloud liquid water content, rain, and sea ice. The additional sensitivity is due to the screening of rain and sea ice from the dependent data and the squared term in the retrieval algorithm. Thus, it will be very important to have good screening procedures for identifying these conditions. The linear algorithm overestimates in the mid-range and underestimates at large values of total precipitable water. The explanation for this effect is probably related to the selection of the center of the water vapor line as the operating frequency of the SSM/I water vapor channel. The line center is most likely to exhibit a saturation effect at large water vapor amounts, and pressure and temperature effects can also be important, depending on the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.58967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.58967","startPage":"811","endPage":"816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/2144/00058967.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of oceanic total precipitable water from the SSM/I","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Determination of oceanic total precipitable water from the SSM/I","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3793058","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58967/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of oceanic total precipitable water from the SSM/I","sourcePdf":"58967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130011S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"184","articleId":"58967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":58972,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The present study is based on a nonlinear, nonparametric four-layer neural network approach. A three-layer neural network architecture, the nonparametric K-nearest neighbor approach, and the linear stepwise discriminant analysis procedure are compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.58972","startPage":"846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/2144/00058972.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.58972","endPage":"855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to cloud classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to cloud classification","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3793061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to cloud classification","sourcePdf":"58972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056019S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"172","articleId":"58972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":58973,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Polarization signatures for backscattered power and correlation observables are derived. Optimal polarization for the power return in two orthogonally polarized radar channels can be determined. Polarizations which extremize mean copolar power can be proved to reduce the correlation of the backscattered wave components exactly to zero. In the case of cross-polar optimal polarizations, a particular correlation difference rather than individual interchannel correlations tends to zero. The utilization of these necessary conditions for the power extrema, furthermore, allows the introduction of an efficient numerical algorithm to compute optimal polarization states for a given target covariance matrix. The presented polarimetric concept is demonstrated to generalize the well-established theory of characteristic polarizations. Analysis of chaff radar data illustrates the efficiency of the outlined approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.58973","startPage":"856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/2144/00058973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.58973","endPage":"864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarimetric radar backscattering from reciprocal random targets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/58973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Polarimetric radar backscattering from reciprocal random targets","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3804178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarimetric radar backscattering from reciprocal random targets","sourcePdf":"58973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027862S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"71","articleId":"58973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":58977,"authors":[{"name":"K.

There are two important ways in which this method differs from traditional top-down synthesis techniques. First, it draws on a newly developed procedural database to collect detailed information on the physical and logical properties of the primitives available for building the design. Second, it partitions each design it considers into clusters that have physical as well as logical significance. This method for representing and organizing knowledge about candidate designs makes it possible to estimate physical placement and wiring, even at the abstract register-transfer (RT) level. This allows a more accurate evaluation of RT designs without doing a full logic-level or transistor-level layout. Partitioning also leads to a simple method for systematically exploring the space of possible designs to find the one that best meets the designer's objectives and constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.59070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.59070","endPage":"950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2149/00059070.pdf","startPage":"938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating bottom-up design into hardware synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59070/","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating bottom-up design into hardware synthesis","volume":"9","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"3765934","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating bottom-up design into hardware synthesis","sourcePdf":"00059070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04677S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"75","articleId":"59070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":59074,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.

The following three decision subproblems are identified: (1) decide if a test vector exists, (2) decide if an initializing vector exists, and (3) decide if a test pair is robust. It is proven that each of these problems is NP-complete. More importantly, it is proved that the first two remain NP-complete for the simplest subcircuit design styles, namely series/parallel nMOS or CMOS logic gates. The third subproblem is shown to be of linear complexity for a CMOS logic gate with a stuck-open fault. It is illustrated that a test pair that is not robust may contain a robust subtest pair, and a necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen in CMOS logic gates is given. This leads to a linear time algorithm for CMOS logic gates which tests for robustness and, if possible, derives a robust test pair from a possibly nonrobust pair. The implications of these complexity results on practical transistor-level test generation tools are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.59075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2149/00059075.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.59075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"995","endPage":"1001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The complexity of fault detection in MOS VLSI circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"The complexity of fault detection in MOS VLSI circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59075/","volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3765939","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The complexity of fault detection in MOS VLSI circuits","sourcePdf":"00059075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047678S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","articleId":"59075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":59122,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The measured noise and modulation distortion properties of ER-doped fiber amplifiers are good enough to meet even the severe quality standards set for trunk lines. A carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of 57 dB for an AM-FDM transmission was measured. A second-order harmonic distortion (HD2) of less than -56 dB was measured by the monotone method (modulation depth m=50%), and a cross modulation distortion (XM) of less than -63 dB was measured by the two-tone method (m=25%*channel). On the basis of these values, composite second-order distortion (CSO) and XM in a 40-channel transmission were estimated as less than -57 dB and -73 dB, respectively. Significant reduction of noise and modulation distortion is made possible by optimizing the length of Er-doped fiber amplifiers and using input- and output-port isolators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.59124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.59124","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2152/00059124.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erbium-doped fiber amplifier for video distribution networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Erbium-doped fiber amplifier for video distribution networks","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3779765","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59124/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erbium-doped fiber amplifier for video distribution networks","sourcePdf":"00059124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042583S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"26","articleId":"59124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":59129,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The 1320-nm diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser is an attractive source for AM video transmission due to the high output power ( approximately 200 mW) and low relative intensity noise (<-170 dB/Hz). However, the required external modulator generates third-order distortion products, which limit the performance of such a system. A predistortion linearization technique is described. It reduces the modulator generated third-order distortion products by 16.4 dB, allowing a modulation index of 3.37% per channel. When combined with the Nd:YAG laser, this yields a 50-channel video transmission system with a 12 dB optical power budget for video carrier-to-noise ratios of 52 dB and composite distortion products (CSO and CTB) of less than -60 dBc. The demonstrated power budget is sufficient to allow four-way power splitting, with the remaining margin comparable to the test results obtained with DFB (distributed-feedback) laser-based AM transmission systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.59139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.59139","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2152/00059139.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel AM video transmission using a high-power Nd:YAG laser and linearized external modulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel AM video transmission using a high-power Nd:YAG laser and linearized external modulator","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3779780","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59139/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel AM video transmission using a high-power Nd:YAG laser and linearized external modulator","sourcePdf":"00059139.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0356S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"65","articleId":"59139","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":59140,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

No receiver sensitivity degradation is observed due to interchannel crosstalk of the 128-channel tunable waveguide frequency selection switch (FS-SW) or fiber four-wave mixing for transmissions over a 50-km-long nondispersion-shifted (NDS) fiber and a 26-km-long dispersion-shifted (DS) fiber.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 100-channel optical FDM transmission/distribution at 622 Mb/s over 50 km","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.59170","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2153/00059170.pdf","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.59170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 100-channel optical FDM transmission/distribution at 622 Mb/s over 50 km","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3780255","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 100-channel optical FDM transmission/distribution at 622 Mb/s over 50 km","sourcePdf":"00059170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040561S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"111","articleId":"59170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":59171,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The optical nonlinearity in a single-mode fiber imposes a fundamental limitation on the capacity of optical frequency-division multiplexed systems. In particular, four-wave mixing (FWM) crosstalk may severely degrade the system performance when the fiber input powers are large and/or the channel spacing is too small. Theoretical and experimental results of the effects of FWM in OFDM systems are presented. The theoretical results demonstrate the dependence of FWM on various system parameters. An analysis of FWM in both undirectional and bidirectional transmission systems is included. The receiver sensitivity degradation from FWM crosstalk is measured in a 16-channel coherent system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.59171","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2153/00059171.pdf","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.59171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of four-wave mixing in fibers on optical frequency-division multiplexed systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59171/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of four-wave mixing in fibers on optical frequency-division multiplexed systems","volume":"8","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3780256","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of four-wave mixing in fibers on optical frequency-division multiplexed systems","sourcePdf":"00059171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034795S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"126","articleId":"59171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":59172,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

For signal powers P/sub s/>or=-62 dBm, the phase error is 0.3 degrees , and is virtually independent of the signal power. When the natural frequency is 74 kHz, the damping factor is 0.03, and the DC gain is 68 MHz, the loop exhibits a chaotic behavior: it maintains the frequency lock, but not the phase lock.

Expressions for the emission cross section sigma /sub e/( lambda ) and absorption cross section sigma /sub a/( lambda ) of erbium:glass as a quasi-three-level laser system with Stark-split sublevel manifolds are derived. The results are used to calculate the cross sections of aluminosilicate erbium-doped fibers at low temperatures (T=4.2, 77 K) and at room temperature. It is demonstrated that an expression for the gain coefficient of the fiber amplifier can be derived from the expression of the susceptibility. Using Kramers-Kronig relations, an expression for the refractive index change in the fiber is derived. The theoretical spectral gain profile of the fiber amplifier and concurrent refractive index changes are analyzed for different pumping regimes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2154/00059191.pdf","startPage":"1517","endPage":"1527","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.59191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.59191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of the complex atomic susceptibility of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical fiber polarization","Laser theory","Laser excitation","Absorption","Optical fiber communication","Crosstalk","Laser modes","Erbium","Glass"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","Kramers-Kronig relations","laser theory","refractive index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lasing transitions","optical pumping","complex atomic susceptibility","emission cross section","absorption cross section","quasi-three-level laser system","Stark-split sublevel manifolds","aluminosilicate","room temperature","gain coefficient","Kramers-Kronig relations","refractive index change","spectral gain profile","pumping regimes","1.53 micron","4.2 K","77 K","Er doped fibre amplifers","Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Study of the complex atomic susceptibility of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","volume":"8","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3780272","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of the complex atomic susceptibility of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00059191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056356S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"106","articleId":"59191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":59195,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The history of this period is reviewed, focusing on people rather than just on theory or technology. The contributions of a number of individuals are discussed and related to how neural network tools are being implemented today. The selection of individuals discussed is somewhat arbitrary and not exhaustive, as the intent is to provide a broad sampling of people who contributed to current neural network technology. Besides James, the authors cover the work of W.C. McCulloch and W. Pitts (1943), D. Hebb (1949), and B. Widrow and M.

The gray-scale levels from 2DE images directly correspond to the intensity of echo signal from cardiac tissue, providing visual texture and allowing qualitative and quantitative analysis of myocardial tissue. A subject population consisting of 11 normal, 7 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 11 myocardial infarction patients was studied. Two types of backpropagational neural networks were used: fully connected, and patterned. In the fully connected network, the outputs of neurodes in each layer are connected to the inputs of all neurodes in the following layer. In the patterned network, only neurodes within a defined neighborhood are connected. The results suggest that the fully connected network provides better classifying performance than the patterned network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/51.59215","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/2155/00059215.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.59215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of neural networks in detecting cardiac diseases from echocardiographic images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Use of neural networks in detecting cardiac diseases from echocardiographic images","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3791711","pubMedId":"18238349","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of neural networks in detecting cardiac diseases from echocardiographic images","sourcePdf":"00059215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031097S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"21","articleId":"59215","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":59280,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

It has been shown that backpropagation, used for feedforward artificial neural networks, is just a degenerate version of an extended Kalman filter, and that networks can do about as well as the optimum statistical classification technique. A method of finding the importance of features for use by a neural network classifier has been determined. Techniques for using neural networks for image segmentation have been developed. In optical pattern recognition, techniques that allow the processing of real FLIR (forward-looking infrared) images with existing binary spatial light modulators have been devised. An optical direction of arrival detector applicable to laser illumination direction determination has been designed and tested; the design is similar to a fly's eye. Coated mirrors for the optical confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer have been designed, specified, fabricated, and installed. Significant progress has been made in the use of neural networks for processing multiple-feature sets for speech recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3782625","volume":"5","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"AFIT neural network research","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AFIT neural network research","sourcePdf":"00059280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078496S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"2","articleId":"59280","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":59305,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

Surface illumination using extended sources makes it possible to ensure the detection of both Lambertian and specular reflections. Uniformly distributed source directions are used to obtain an image sequence of the object. This method of obtaining photometric measurements is called photometric sampling. An extraction algorithm uses the set of image intensity values measured at each surface point to compute orientation as well as relative strengths of the Lambertian and specular reflection components. The simultaneous recovery of shape and reflectance parameters enables the method to adapt to variations in reflectance properties from one scene point to another.

It indicates that in order to increase the fraction of pump power that contributes to the amplification of the input laser field relative to that spent in overcoming internal losses, an amplifier should operate at as high an excitation level as possible. This may mean operating an amplifier above its free-running oscillation threshold. A limitation to the maximum pump power is the increase in ASE. With too high an excitation, ASE dominates over the amplified input laser field, resulting in a quenching of the amplifier gain, efficiency and coherence. ASE effects may be mitigated by increasing the input laser intensity, decreasing the amplifier facet reflectivities, or, in some cases, tuning the master oscillator so that it is resonant with the amplifier. The analysis indicates that minimizing the facet reflectivity is the most effective way to circumvent ASE limitations to power scaling semiconductor laser amplifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spontaneous emission","Semiconductor lasers","Pump lasers","Laser tuning","Laser excitation","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Power lasers","Reflectivity","Performance analysis","High power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser theory","semiconductor junction lasers","superradiance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["master oscillator tuning","quantitative method","semiconductor laser amplifier performance","ASE","amplified spontaneous emission","pump power","internal losses","excitation level","amplifier gain","efficiency","coherence","input laser intensity","amplifier facet reflectivities","power scaling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.59683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2171/00059683.pdf","startPage":"1363","endPage":"1368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.59683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplified spontaneous emission effects in semiconductor laser amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Amplified spontaneous emission effects in semiconductor laser amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59683/","volume":"26","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3803872","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplified spontaneous emission effects in semiconductor laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00059683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034278S","chronDate":"Aug 1990","isNumber":"2171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"14","articleId":"59683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":59684,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Thereafter, the amplitude, phase and polarization of the E-field is traced along the ray paths to the aperture; this is referred to as dynamic ray tracing.

For a given set of elements, the technique allows one to find a set of array coefficients that steer the main beam in a given direction and yield sidelobes meeting a specified criterion, if such a set of array coefficients exists. If the pattern specifications cannot be met with the given elements, the algorithm finds the best attainable pattern. The advantage of this technique is that it can be used with an arbitrary set of array elements. Different elements in the array can have different element patterns, and the array can have arbitrary nonuniform spacing between elements. The synthesis technique is based on adaptive array theory. The given array elements are assumed to be used as the elements of an adaptive array. The main beam is pointed in the proper direction by choosing the steering vector for that direction, and the sidelobes are controlled by introducing a large number of interfering signals at many angles throughout the sidelobe region. The algorithm iterates on the interference powers until a suitable pattern is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2174/00059781.pdf","startPage":"1666","endPage":"1676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.59781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.59781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A numerical pattern synthesis algorithm for arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Interference","Apertures","Signal synthesis","Receiving antennas","Chebyshev approximation","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","pattern synthesis algorithm","numerical technique","array coefficients","main beam","sidelobes","arbitrary nonuniform spacing","adaptive array theory","steering vector","interfering signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"A numerical pattern synthesis algorithm for arrays","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3803704","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A numerical pattern synthesis algorithm for arrays","sourcePdf":"00059781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111033S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"146","articleId":"59781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":59784,"authors":[{"name":"H.V.

Results are presented in terms of the one-way propagation factor in decibels at each frequency. Long-term cumulative frequency distributions of calculated and observed propagation factors are presented. Particular attention is given to the relative performance of each radio frequency to investigate frequency-diversity improvements that may be available on such paths. In most cases presented, there is a close agreement between theory and observations. It is concluded that substantial improvements in received signal levels are likely to be achieved in most areas of the world by a suitable choice of two frequencies in the 10-20-GHz range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3803707","displayDocTitle":"Frequency diversity effects of evaporation duct propagation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency diversity effects of evaporation duct propagation","sourcePdf":"00059784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04408S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","articleId":"59784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":59815,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In digital data and/or sound broadcasting systems, which may have a relatively low bit-rate transmission requirement, the residual phase noise introduced by the Doppler shift of moving vehicles presents a high bit-error floor in coherently demodulated systems. The overall performance of noncoherent systems is frequently superior in a mobile radio environment. In addition, to satisfy the high-power and spectral-efficiency requirements of emerging digital-broadcast systems, nonlinear saturated amplifiers may become essential subsystems. The performance of the new generation of SP-QPSK systems is investigated experimentally and by computer simulations. Digital signal processing implementation techniques have been used in the experimental prototype design. The authors demonstrate that nonlinearly amplified SP-QPSK has a 10-dB-lower out-of-band radiated power than conventional QPSK and it is suitable for differential and discriminator detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.59845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/2177/00059845.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.59845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SP-QPSK: a new modulation technique for satellite and land-mobile digital broadcasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59845/","displayDocTitle":"SP-QPSK: a new modulation technique for satellite and land-mobile digital broadcasting","volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","accessionNumber":"3803715","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SP-QPSK: a new modulation technique for satellite and land-mobile digital broadcasting","sourcePdf":"00059845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035713S","chronDate":"Sep 1990","isNumber":"2177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"5","articleId":"59845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":59853,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is shown that the geographical distribution of a station's location in a given area can adversely affect the spectrum availability. When the variance of a station's locations is small, the spectrum appears to be more congested, which reduces the possibility of finding interference-free frequencies for new systems. This apparent congestion can be looked at as a virtual shrinkage of available spectrum resources. A model is developed that can be used to calculate the true level of spectrum utilization in a given area. The model takes into account the geographical distribution of radio systems and quantifies the relation between the variance of a system's locations and the amount of assignable spectrum. The validity of the model is verified by numerical examples and by data collected in three major Canadian cities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3803791","volume":"32","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The effect of user's geographical distribution on the utilization of radio spectrum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of user's geographical distribution on the utilization of radio spectrum","sourcePdf":"00059888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026428S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"2180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"1","articleId":"59888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":59889,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The exact location of the maximum voltage along the line depends not only on the closest distance from the striking point to the line but also on lightning-current parameters.

The photosite elements in these devices consist of a JFET transistor with the gate capacitively coupled to an address line. The addressed cell is reset by forward biasing the gate-drain junction. During evaluation of the first prototype samples it was found that this reset method has some disadvantages for the device dynamic range and the cell-to-cell signal interference. To eliminate these problems, a method of resetting the photocell using the source-gate junction has been developed and experimentally tested. An analysis of the reset method in the steady-state and transient modes of operation is presented as well as an analysis of noise. The results are used to explain the observation of an image lag which has been detected in these sensors and to calculate the photosite sensitivity which is related to the photosite noise floor. It is shown that the introduction of a small amount of bias charge into the photosite improves the image lag characteristic; however, an ideal solution of this problem is not described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.59909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2181/00059909.pdf","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2200","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00059909.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.59909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the photosite reset in FGA image sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59909/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the photosite reset in FGA image sensors","volume":"37","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1990","accessionNumber":"3803731","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the photosite reset in FGA image sensors","sourcePdf":"00059909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049447S","chronDate":"Oct 1990","isNumber":"2181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"59909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":59911,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The multiple-access channel (MAC) that is used in the TANMAS is a discrete-time noiseless real adder channel used without feedback with N real or binary inputs. Each input may be affected by an unknown, slowly varying channel gain and by an unknown, slowly varying channel offset. A set of N codes is constructed such that the sum of codewords of any known set of T or less active users is uniquely decodable. The sum rate of the codes approaches one from above if the input alphabet of the MAC is binary, and it approaches one from below if the input symbols are real numbers. For the case when the set of active users is unknown. For the case when the set of active users is unknown, it is shown that this set can be identified uniquely (in addition to unique decodability) provided that at most T/2 users are active simultaneously. The sum rate is then reduced to 1/2, which is approached from above and from below, respectively, for binary and for real channel inputs. A simple decoding algorithm which operates over the reals is given for the case when the set of active users is known. It is pointed out that one of the applications of the given codes is in hybrid multiple-access systems that use both multiple-access coding and collision resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.59923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2182/00059923.pdf","startPage":"1206","endPage":"1219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.59923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A class of codes for a T active users out of N multiple-access communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59923/","displayDocTitle":"A class of codes for a T active users out of N multiple-access communication system","volume":"36","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825303","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of codes for a T active users out of N multiple-access communication system","sourcePdf":"59923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047961S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"73","articleId":"59923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":59924,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

A simple form for the constrained CR bound is obtained when the constraint set Theta /sub C/, can be expressed as a smooth functional inequality constraint. It is shown that the constrained CR bound is identical to the unconstrained CR bound at the regular points of Theta /sub C/, i.e. where no equality constraints are active. On the other hand, at those points theta in Theta /sub C/ where pure equality constraints are active the full-rank Fisher information matrix in the unconstrained CR bound must be replaced by a rank-reduced Fisher information matrix obtained as a projection of the full-rank Fisher matrix onto the tangent hyperplane of the full-rank Fisher matrix onto the tangent hyperplane of the constraint set at theta . A necessary and sufficient condition involving the forms of the constraint and the likelihood function is given for the bound to be achievable, and examples for which the bound is achieved are presented. In addition to providing a useful generalization of the CR bound, the results permit analysis of the gain in achievable MSE performance due to the imposition of particular constraints on the parameter space without the need for a global reparameterization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825309","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Lower bounds for parametric estimation with constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower bounds for parametric estimation with constraints","sourcePdf":"00059929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047247S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"227","articleId":"59929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":59930,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

Expressions are obtained for the moments, moment generating functions, amplitude probability density functions, autocorrelation functions, and power spectral densities for a variety of parameters of the process. For certain parameters the power spectral density exhibits 1/f-type behavior over a substantial range of frequencies, so that the process serves as a source of 1/f/sup alpha / shot noise for alpha in the range 0< alpha <2. For other parameters the amplitude probability density function is a Levy-stable random variable with dimension less than unity. This process then behaves as a fractal shot noise that does not converge to a Gaussian amplitude distribution as the driving rate increases without limit. Fractal shot noise is a stationary continuous-time process that is fundamentally different from fractional Brownian motion. Several physical processes that are well described by power-law noise in certain domains are considered: 1/f shot noise, Cherenkov radiation from a random stream of charged particles, diffusion of randomly injected concentration packets the electric field at the growing edge of a quantum wire, and the mass distribution of solid-particle aggregates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3825310","volume":"36","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power-law shot noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-law shot noise","sourcePdf":"00059930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065723S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"161","articleId":"59930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":59931,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Autom. Control, vol.34, no.5, p.568-74, May 1989) for a zero-mean signal corrupted by multiplicative noise in its measurement model. This recursive filter cannot be obtained by the recursive structure of a conventional Kalman filter where the new estimate is a linear combination of the previous estimate and the new data. Instead, the recursive structure was achieved by combining the previous estimate with recursive innovation, a linear combination of the most recent two data samples and the previous estimate. In this work the signal is extended to be nonzero-mean. In the conventional Kalman filter, the superposition principle can be applied to both the signal and the measurement models for this nonzero-mean extension. However, when multiplicative noise exists, the measurement model becomes nonlinear. Therefore, a new recursive structure for the innovation process needs to be developed to achieve a recursive filter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2182/00059939.pdf","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.59939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.59939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new recursive filter for systems with multiplicative noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Recursive estimation","Technological innovation","Nonlinear filters","Kalman filters","Signal processing","Additive noise","Sun","Springs","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","interference (signal)","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal linear recursive estimator","MMSE estimator","nonzero-mean signal","nonlinear measurement mode","recursive filter","multiplicative noise","minimum mean-square-error estimator","zero-mean signal","recursive innovation","Kalman filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"A new recursive filter for systems with multiplicative noise","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825319","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new recursive filter for systems with multiplicative noise","sourcePdf":"00059939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052651S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","articleId":"59939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":59943,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Virtually every linear code is good, in the sense that it meets the Gilbert-Varshamov bound on distance versus redundancy. Despite the sophisticated constructions for codes derived over the years, however, no one has succeeded in demonstrating a constructive procedure that yields such codes over arbitrary symbol fields. Using the theory of Kolmogorov complexity, it is shown that this statement holds true in a rigorous mathematical sense: any linear code that is truly random, in the sense that there is no concise way of specifying the code, is good. Furthermore, random selection of a code that does contain some constructive pattern results, with probability bounded away from zero, in a code that does not meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound regardless of the block length of the code. In contrast to the situation for linear codes, it is shown that there are effectively random nonlinear codes which have no guarantee on distance. In addition, it is shown that the techniques of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to derive typical properties of classes of codes in a novel way.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.59944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2182/00059944.pdf","startPage":"1453","endPage":"1461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.59944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Any code of which we cannot think is good","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Any code of which we cannot think is good","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3825324","volume":"36","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Any code of which we cannot think is good","sourcePdf":"00059944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030125S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"59944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":59946,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

Using this fact, a number of binary irreducible quasi-cyclic codes of index 2 are constructed and their weight spectra obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00059946.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2182/00059946.pdf","startPage":"1463","endPage":"1466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.59946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.59946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=59946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The trace description of irreducible quasi-cyclic codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Military computing","Councils","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["q-ary codes","binary codes","trace description","irreducible quasi-cyclic code","weight spectra"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/59946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"The trace description of irreducible quasi-cyclic codes","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3825326","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The trace description of irreducible quasi-cyclic codes","sourcePdf":"00059946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03333S","chronDate":"Nov 1990","isNumber":"2182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","articleId":"59946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":59949,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.
