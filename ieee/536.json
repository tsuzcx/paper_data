The network is protected from fiber/equipment failures by using optical switches to bridge the optical signals and dual feed them on diversely routed working line and protection line or neighbor line. When the failure is detected, the protection mechanism will be activated and divert the optical signal direction to the protection line or neighbor line according to the types of failure condition and location of failures in PON.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11047912","htmlLink":"/document/5360012/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Architecture of Protection Switching Device (PSD)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Architecture of Protection Switching Device (PSD)","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3892a010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048106S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5359672","isNumber":"5359673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5359672","xplore-issue":"5359673","articleId":"5360012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5360013,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Krishna Mulpuru","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Sai Krishna","lastName":"Mulpuru","id":"37668147600"},{"name":"Krishna Chaitanya Kollu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Krishna Chaitanya","lastName":"Kollu","id":"37668147900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5360013","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360013","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new method of route planning for multiple robots in an unknown space with randomly placed obstacles. First, we use the basic principles of multi agent systems and particle swarm optimization algorithm. At the core, we implement our proposed method of circularly drifting the robot around the corners of the obstacle at a desired angle which gives us the freedom in designing the robot's angular mobility. Also, communication between robots about the obstacles and the traversed space helps in obtaining their next positions. Then the optimal route planned is shown till the robots safely reach the target without any collisions. Simulations are performed by avoiding obstacles using circular drift method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCTD.2009.32","startPage":"15","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5359672/5359673/05360013.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCTD.2009.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5359673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Route Planning for Multiple Robots Using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent robots","Particle swarm optimization","Orbital robotics","Robot kinematics","Space technology","Robot sensing systems","Technology planning","Mobile robots","Cancer","Neoplasms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","multi-agent systems","multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple robots","intelligent route planning","particle swarm optimization","multi agent systems","robot angular mobility","circular drift method","obstacle avoidance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","route planning","obstacle avoidance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Route Planning for Multiple Robots Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5360013/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11047913","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Route Planning for Multiple Robots Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3892a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044399S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5359672","isNumber":"5359673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5359672","xplore-issue":"5359673","articleId":"5360013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5360032,"authors":[{"name":"Salman A.

The proposed algorithm is used to efficiently solve the distributed local area network (DLAN)topology design problem, which is an NP-hard optimization problem.

The most well known technique for edge detection is gradient-based. There are number of methods that have been used to make an implementation of a gradient-based edge detection algorithm design. This paper proposes a design and implementation of gradient based edge detection algorithm using of Sobel operator. An image is captured by a CMOS camera and converted into grayscale to obtain image intensity for edge detection. The Sobel edge detection operator is controlled by Finite State Machine (FSM) which executes a matrix area gradient operation to determine the level of variance through different of pixels and display the result on a monitor. The whole process is performed in the hardware level and implemented on an Altera field programmable gate array platform. The result shows good performance of edge detection with 27 MHz clock operation which is able to detect just within 2ms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA Implementation of Gradient Based Edge Detection Algorithm Design","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development","doi":"10.1109/ICCTD.2009.39","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5359672/5360033/05360129.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCTD.2009.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA Implementation of Gradient Based Edge Detection Algorithm Design","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5360129/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11047931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA Implementation of Gradient Based Edge Detection Algorithm Design","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3892b165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067421S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5359672","isNumber":"5360033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5359672","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5360033","articleId":"5360129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5360132,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Rashid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Rashid","id":"37671425500"},{"name":"Abdul Rauf Baig","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abdul Rauf","lastName":"Baig","id":"38556317900"},{"name":"Kashif Zafar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Kashif","lastName":"Zafar","id":"37402286600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3892-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5360132","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360132","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Computer science","Clamps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","subswarm strategy","multimodal optimization","niching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["niche","sub-swarm","swarm intelligence","particle swarm optimization","multimodal functions","optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCTD.2009.30","pdfPath":"/iel5/5359672/5360033/05360132.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Technology and Development","startPage":"181","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCTD.2009.30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Niching with Sub-swarm Based Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"In this study, we present a sub-swarm based particle swarm optimization algorithm for niching (NSPSO).

Execution anomalies include both work flow errors and low performance problems. People often use system logs produced by distributed systems for troubleshooting and problem diagnosis. However, manually inspecting system logs to detect anomalies is unfeasible due to the increasing scale and complexity of distributed systems. Therefore, there is a great demand for automatic anomalies detection techniques based on log analysis. In this paper, we propose an unstructured log analysis technique for anomalies detection. In the technique, we propose a novel algorithm to convert free form text messages in log files to log keys without heavily relying on application specific knowledge. The log keys correspond to the log-print statements in the source code which can provide cues of system execution behavior. After converting log messages to log keys, we learn a Finite State Automaton (FSA) from training log sequences to present the normal work flow for each system component. At the same time, a performance measurement model is learned to characterize the normal execution performance based on the log messages' timing information. With these learned models, we can automatically detect anomalies in newly input log files. Experiments on Hadoop and SILK show that the technique can effectively detect running anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.60","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","startPage":"149","endPage":"158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Execution Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems through Unstructured Log Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Execution Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems through Unstructured Log Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11047990","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Execution Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems through Unstructured Log Analysis","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063293S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5360241,"authors":[{"name":"Quanquan Gu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Intelligent Technology and Systems Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList) Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Quanquan","lastName":"Gu","id":"37399013800"},{"name":"Jie Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Intelligent Technology and Systems Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList) Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278266700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5242-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3895-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"5360241","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web pages","Clustering methods","Machine learning","Laboratories","Data mining","Intelligent systems","Information science","Automation","Convergence","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","minimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitask clustering","transductive transfer classification","clustering performance","within-task clustering","data clustering","cross-task clustering","learning","cross-domain classification","domain adaption","minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-task clustering","transductive transfer classification","multi-task learning","transfer learning","cross domain classification","domain adaption"]}],"abstract":"There are many clustering tasks which are closely related in the real world, e.g. clustering the Web pages of different universities. However, existing clustering approaches neglect the underlying relation and treat these clustering tasks either individually or simply together. In this paper, we will study a novel clustering paradigm, namely multi-task clustering, which performs multiple related clustering tasks together and utilizes the relation of these tasks to enhance the clustering performance. We aim to learn a subspace shared by all the tasks, through which the knowledge of the tasks can be transferred to each other. The objective of our approach consists of two parts: (1) Within-task clustering: clustering the data of each task in its input space individually; and (2) Cross-task clustering: simultaneous learning the shared subspace and clustering the data of all the tasks together. We will show that it can be solved by alternating minimization, and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, we will show that given the labels of one task, our multi-task clustering method can be extended to transductive transfer classification (a.k.a. cross-domain classification, domain adaption). Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that the proposed multi-task clustering outperforms traditional single-task clustering methods greatly. And the transductive transfer classification method is comparable to or even better than several existing transductive transfer classification approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.32","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","startPage":"159","endPage":"168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning the Shared Subspace for Multi-task Clustering and Transductive Transfer Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning the Shared Subspace for Multi-task Clustering and Transductive Transfer Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360241/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11047991","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360241/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning the Shared Subspace for Multi-task Clustering and Transductive Transfer Classification","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085862S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360245,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Jiang","affiliation":["Eng.

However, search engines usually return a long list of Web pages, which may be relevant to many namesakes, especially given the explosive growth of Web data. To address the challenge caused by name ambiguity in Web people search, this paper proposes a novel graph-based framework, GRAPE (abbr. a graph-based framework for disambiguating people appearances in Web search). In GRAPE, people tag information (e.g., people name, organization, and email address) surrounding the queried people name is extracted from the search results, a graph-based unsupervised algorithm is then developed to cluster the extracted tags, where a new method, cohesion, is introduced to measure the importance of a tag for clustering, and each final cluster of tags represents a unique people entity. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art Web people name disambiguation approaches.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.25","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.25","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360245.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRAPE: A Graph-Based Framework for Disambiguating People Appearances in Web Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GRAPE: A Graph-Based Framework for Disambiguating People Appearances in Web Search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11047995","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360245/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRAPE: A Graph-Based Framework for Disambiguating People Appearances in Web Search","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095592S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5360248,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The performance is restricted by the availability of labeled words. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised approach to improve the sequence labeling procedure in IE through a class of algorithms with self-learned features (SLF). A supervised classifier can be trained with annotated text sequences and used to classify each word in a large set of unannotated sentences. By averaging predicted labels over all cases in the unlabeled corpus, SLF training builds class label distribution patterns for each word (or word attribute) in the dictionary and re-trains the current model iteratively adding these distributions as extra word features. Basic SLF models how likely a word could be assigned to target class types. Several extensions are proposed, such as learning words' class boundary distributions. SLF exhibits robust and scalable behaviour and is easy to tune. We applied this approach on four classical IE tasks: named entity recognition (German and English), part-of-speech tagging (English) and one gene name recognition corpus. Experimental results show effective improvements over the supervised baselines on all tasks. In addition, when compared with the closely related self-training idea, this approach shows favorable advantages.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Labeling","USA Councils","Data mining","Natural language processing","Computer science","Predictive models","Tagging","Neural networks","Machine learning","National electric code"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semisupervised sequence labeling","self-learned features","information extraction systems","tasks assigning labels","natural language sequence","supervised classifier","annotated text sequences","named entity recognition","part-of-speech tagging","gene name recognition corpus"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semi-supervised learning","semi-supervised feature learning","structural output learning","sequence labeling","self-learned features","information extraction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.40","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360268.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Supervised Sequence Labeling with Self-Learned Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Supervised Sequence Labeling with Self-Learned Features","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360268/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360268/","accessionNumber":"11048018","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Supervised Sequence Labeling with Self-Learned Features","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132268S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5360278,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Thurau","affiliation":["Schloss Birlinghoven, Fraunhofer IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Thurau","id":"37671378400"},{"name":"Kristian Kersting","affiliation":["Schloss Birlinghoven, Fraunhofer IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Kersting","id":"37593233900"},{"name":"Christian Bauckhage","affiliation":["Schloss Birlinghoven, Fraunhofer IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bauckhage","id":"37270389000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5242-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3895-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"5360278","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":666},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convex Non-negative Matrix Factorization in the Wild","abstract":"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has recently received a lot of attention in data mining, information retrieval, and computer vision. It factorizes a non-negative input matrix V into two non-negative matrix factors V = WH such that W describes \"clusters\" of the datasets. Analyzing genotypes, social networks, or images, it can be beneficial to ensure V to contain meaningful \"cluster centroids\", i.e., to restrict W to be convex combinations of data points. But how can we run this convex NMF in the wild, i.e., given millions of data points? Triggered by the simple observation that each data point is a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we propose to restrict W further to be vertices of the convex hull. The benefits of this convex-hull NMF approach are twofold. First, the expected size of the convex hull of, for example, n random Gaussian points in the plane is \u00bf(\u00bflog n), i.e., the candidate set typically grows much slower than the data set. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow one to compute candidate vertices efficiently. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex NMF for large data sets both in terms of speed and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we show that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world data sets, in our case consisting of 1.6 million images respectively 150 million votes on World of Warcraft \u00ae guilds.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Information retrieval","Computer vision","Data analysis","Image analysis","Social network services","Embedded computing","Image reconstruction","Large-scale systems","Voting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","data mining","information retrieval","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex hull non-negative matrix factorization","data mining","information retrieval","computer vision","cluster centroids","data convex hull","random Gaussian points"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data mining","matrix decomposition","data handling","non negative matrix factorization","archetypal analysis","social network analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360278","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.55","startPage":"523","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360278.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.55","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360278/","displayDocTitle":"Convex Non-negative Matrix Factorization in the Wild","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11048028","htmlLink":"/document/5360278/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex Non-negative Matrix Factorization in the Wild","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080479S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5360285,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37674799500"},{"name":"Ling Huang","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Huang","id":"38559976700"},{"name":"Armando Fox","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Armando","lastName":"Fox","id":"37278066200"},{"name":"David Patterson","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Patterson","id":"37274686300"},{"name":"Michael Jordan","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Jordan","id":"37269675800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5242-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3895-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"5360285","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1090},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Data mining","USA Councils","Condition monitoring","Machine learning","Software maintenance","Statistical learning","Computerized monitoring","Web and internet services","Web server"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online system problem detection","data mining patterns","console logs","statistical learning method","online setting","stage detection system","frequent pattern mining","distribution estimation","principal component analysis","anomaly detection","real system data","203-node Hadoop cluster","execution patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["console logs","system management","monitoring","problem detection","logs","pattern mining"]}],"abstract":"We describe a novel application of using data mining and statistical learning methods to automatically monitor and detect abnormal execution traces from console logs in an online setting.

Most existing methods treat anomalies as inconsistencies and spend the majority amount of time on modeling normal instances. A recently proposed, sampling-based approach may substantially boost the efficiency in anomaly detection but may also lead to weaker accuracy and robustness. In this study, we propose a two-stage approach to find anomalies in complex datasets with high accuracy as well as low time complexity and space cost. Instead of analyzing normal instances, our algorithm first employs an efficient deterministic space partition algorithm to eliminate obvious normal instances and generates a small set of anomaly candidates with a single scan of the dataset. It then checks each candidate with density-based multiple criteria to determine the final results. This two-stage framework also detects anomalies of different notions. Our experiments show that this new approach finds anomalies successfully in different conditions and ensures a good balance of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.44","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360288.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","startPage":"617","endPage":"626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filtering and Refinement: A Two-Stage Approach for Efficient and Effective Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Filtering and Refinement: A Two-Stage Approach for Efficient and Effective Anomaly Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360288/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11048038","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360288/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filtering and Refinement: A Two-Stage Approach for Efficient and Effective Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060241S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360289,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289128800"},{"name":"Xingquan Zhu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering & Information Technology, QCIS Center, Sydney, NSW, Australia","FEDS Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Faculty of Eng. & IT, Univ. of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xingquan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085358169"},{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["FEDS Center, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Guo","id":"37288442100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5242-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3895-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"5360289","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":701},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360289","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Predictive models","Labeling","Computers","Australia","Support vector machines","Virtual manufacturing","Availability","Warehousing","Association rules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data stream mining","prediction model","relational k-means algorithm","transfer semisupervised learning","SVM learning framework","RK-TS3VM","unlabeled training samples"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data stream","unlabeled samples","support vector machines"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a framework to build prediction models from data streams which contain both labeled and unlabeled examples. We argue that due to the increasing data collection ability but limited resources for labeling, stream data collected at hand may only have a small number of labeled examples, whereas a large portion of data remain unlabeled but can be beneficial for learning. Unleashing the full potential of the unlabeled instances for stream data mining is, however, a significant challenge, consider that even fully labeled data streams may suffer from the concept drifting, and inappropriate uses of the unlabeled samples may only make the problem even worse. To build prediction models, we first categorize the stream data into four different categories, each of which corresponds to the situation where concept drifting may or may not exist in the labeled and unlabeled data. After that, we propose a relational k-means based transfer semi-supervised SVM learning framework (RK-TS\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nVM), which intends to leverage labeled and unlabeled samples to build prediction models.

Motivated by the recent theory on direct information sampling called compressed sensing (CS), we propose a framework for detecting anomalies from these large-scale data mining applications where the full information is not practically possible to obtain. Exploiting the fact that the intrinsic dimension of the data in these applications are typically small relative to the raw dimension and the fact that compressed sensing is capable of capturing most information with few measurements, our work show that spectral methods that used for volume anomaly detection can be directly applied to the CS data with guarantee on performance. Our theoretical contributions are supported by extensive experimental results on large datasets which show satisfactory performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360301.pdf","startPage":"722","endPage":"727","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks Data Streams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Large-scale systems","Compressed sensing","Data mining","Bandwidth","Computer networks","Physics computing","Databases","Streaming media","Paper technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","data mining","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","sensor network data stream","data mining","direct information sampling","compressed sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stream data processing","anomaly detection","spectral methods","residual analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effective Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks Data Streams","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360301/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11048051","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks Data Streams","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059011S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5360305,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37674522500"},{"name":"Weike Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Weike","lastName":"Pan","id":"37529961000"},{"name":"James T.

The feature selection problem in multi-task setting has many applications in fields of computer vision, text classification and bio-informatics. Generally, it can be realized by solving a L-1-infinity regularized optimization problem. And the solution automatically yields the joint sparsity among different tasks. However, due to the nonsmooth nature of the L-1-infinity norm, there lacks an efficient training algorithm for solving such problem with general convex loss functions. In this paper, we propose an accelerated gradient method based on an ``optimal'' first order black-box method named after Nesterov and provide the convergence rate for smooth convex loss functions. For nonsmooth convex loss functions, such as hinge loss, our method still has fast convergence rate empirically. Moreover, by exploiting the structure of the L-1-infinity ball, we solve the black-box oracle in Nesterov's method by a simple sorting scheme. Our method is suitable for large-scale multi-task learning problem since it only utilizes the first order information and is very easy to implement. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the most state-of-the-art methods in both convergence speed and learning accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.128","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360305.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","startPage":"746","endPage":"751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated Gradient Method for Multi-task Sparse Learning Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated Gradient Method for Multi-task Sparse Learning Problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360305/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11048055","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360305/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated Gradient Method for Multi-task Sparse Learning Problem","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895a746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062054S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360349,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Tang","id":"37676545600"},{"name":"Zhengdong Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Computational Engineering & Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengdong","lastName":"Lu","id":"37066376300"},{"name":"Inderjit S.

In many real-world applications, however, entities are often associated with relations of different types and/or from different sources, which can be well captured by multiple undirected graphs over the same set of vertices. How to exploit such multiple sources of information to make better inferences on entities remains an interesting open problem. In this paper, we focus on the problem of clustering the vertices based on multiple graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. As one of our contributions, we propose Linked Matrix Factorization (LMF) as a novel way of fusing information from multiple graph sources. In LMF, each graph is approximated by matrix factorization with a graph-specific factor and a factor common to all graphs, where the common factor provides features for all vertices. Experiments on SIAM journal data show that (1) we can improve the clustering accuracy through fusing multiple sources of information with several models, and (2) LMF yields superior or competitive results compared to other graph-based clustering methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering methods","Data mining","Information resources","Data engineering","Supervised learning","Machine learning","Clustering algorithms","Inference algorithms","Industrial relations","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph based learning models","undirected graph","graph clustering","unsupervised learning","semi-supervised learning","linked matrix factorization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clustering","multiple sources","graph","semi-supervised learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360349","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2009.125","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1021","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360037/5360038/05360349.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2009.125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360349/","displayDocTitle":"Clustering with Multiple Graphs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11048099","htmlLink":"/document/5360349/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering with Multiple Graphs","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3895b016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098208S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360037","isNumber":"5360038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360037","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5360038","articleId":"5360349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360419,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxuan Gao","affiliation":["Ecully and Grenoble Ecole de Management, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Wenxuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37672494300"},{"name":"Robert Grossman","affiliation":["Ecully and Grenoble Ecole de Management, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Grossman","id":"37270222000"},{"name":"Philip S.

Conversely, it also provides validation of existing labels, if any. While training, our method does not assume any explicit manual annotation other than the weak labels already available in the form of video title, description, and tags. Prior work related to such auto-annotation assumed that a vocabulary of labels of interest (e. g., indoor, outdoor, city, landscape) is specified a priori. In contrast, the proposed method begins with an empty vocabulary. It analyzes audiovisual features of 25 million YouTube. com videos - nearly 150 years of video data -- effectively searching for consistent correlation between these features and text metadata. It autonomously extends the label vocabulary as and when it discovers concepts it can reliably identify, eventually leading to a vocabulary with thousands of labels and growing.

Such cases arise for example when the training data is collected from different sources with different labeling criteria or when the data is generated by a biased decision process. When a classifier is trained directly on such data, these undesirable dependencies will carry over to the classifier's predictions. In order to tackle this problem, we study the classification with independency constraints problem: find an accurate model for which the predictions are independent from a given binary attribute. We propose two solutions for this problem and present an empirical validation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360416/5360417/05360534.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2009.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2009.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building Classifiers with Independency Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Data mining","Predictive models","Conferences","Electronic mail","Labeling","Prediction algorithms","Constraint optimization","Machine learning","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classifier learning","data contains","data attributes","training data","labeling criteria","biased decision process","classifier training","classifier prediction","classification","independency constraints problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Building Classifiers with Independency Constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360534/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11048220","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"6-6 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building Classifiers with Independency Constraints","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3902a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040058S","chronDate":"6-6 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360416","isNumber":"5360417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360416","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5360417","articleId":"5360534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5360599,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Liu","affiliation":["School of Economy and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37673507100"},{"name":"Weiguo Fang","affiliation":["School of Economy and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiguo","lastName":"Fang","id":"37671375300"},{"name":"Hong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Economy and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37675981700"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["School of Economy and Management, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37676367600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3735-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5360599","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Hidden Markov models","Bayesian methods","Probability","Information processing","Predictive models","Testing","Fuzzy systems","Conference management","Knowledge management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","character recognition","natural language processing","probability","Viterbi detection","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bigram Chinese word segmentation","Viterbi algorithm","Chinese information processing","Bayesian network","character alignment Viterbi algorithm","Chinese character","n-gram probability","state transition probability","word recognition","foreign person name","domestic person name"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian Network","Viterbi Algorithm","N-gram"]}],"abstract":"Chinese word segmentation is an important foundation for Chinese information processing.

We propose simple channel estimation techniques based on the codebook stored in the baseband. We show from our some selected simulations that, when the exact phase information is available, the loss of beamforming gain of our proposed PLRC is not significant in terms of both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate compared to the conventional baseband beamforming techniques while the power consumption of our proposed scheme can be much saved by using the single RF chain and single ADC.

Femto-cells promise substantial gains in spectral efficiency due to an enhanced reuse of radio resources. However, owing to their random and uncoordinated deployment, they potentially cause destructive interference to macro-cells and vice-versa. In order to maintain reliable service of macro-cells, it is most important to mitigate destructive femto to macro-cell interference. In the downlink, this can be achieved by dynamic resource partitioning, in the way that femto base stations (BSs) are denied access to resources that are assigned to nearby macro mobile stations (MSs). By doing so, interference to the macro-cells is effectively controlled, at the expense of a modest degradation in femto-cell capacity. The necessary signalling is conveyed through the wired backbone, using the downlink high interference indicator (DL-HII).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360723.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femto-Cell Resource Partitioning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Ultrafast electronics","Downlink","Radio frequency","Throughput","Spine","Digital communication","RF signals","Signal processing","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference (signal)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femto cell resource partitioning","shares radio frequency resource","urban macrocell","spectral efficiency","destructive interference","dynamic resource partitioning","femto base stations","downlink high interference indicator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"Femto-Cell Resource Partitioning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360723/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036812","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femto-Cell Resource Partitioning","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099566S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360724,"authors":[{"name":"Toktam Mahmoodi","affiliation":["Centre of Telecommunications Research, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Toktam","lastName":"Mahmoodi","id":"37398697100"},{"name":"Vasilis Friderikos","affiliation":["Centre of Telecommunications Research, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Vasilis","lastName":"Friderikos","id":"37275194000"},{"name":"Hamid Aghvami","affiliation":["Centre of Telecommunications Research, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Aghvami","id":"37275207700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5626-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5625-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5360724","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a dynamic OFDMA based subcarrier/power allocation which aims to protect the newly established TCP connections.

With this fast development of new communication standards, it becomes very difficult for users and also for communications devices producers, to stay compatible with all standards used and with the oncoming ones. For that reason, cognitive radio systems seem to provide an interesting solution to this problem. The conception of intelligent receiver able to adapt itself to a specific transmission context and to blindly estimate the transmitter parameters is a promising solution for the future. In such context, new coding schemes like turbocodes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) or concatenated codes are developed to increase transmission robustness without significant degradation of the data rate. It is why we have developed a method, described in this paper, dedicated to the blind identification of convolutional encoders usually used in many standards. Moreover, an analysis of the method performances is detailed.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360726","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360726.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Code Method for Blind Identification of Convolutional Encoder for Cognitive Radio Receiver Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dual Code Method for Blind Identification of Convolutional Encoder for Cognitive Radio Receiver Design","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360726/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036815","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Code Method for Blind Identification of Convolutional Encoder for Cognitive Radio Receiver Design","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074405S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360727,"authors":[{"name":"Shingo Sasaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chiba Institute of Technology, Narashino, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"37665516500"},{"name":"Takahiko Saba","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chiba Institute of Technology, Narashino, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiko","lastName":"Saba","id":"37283697900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5626-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5625-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5360727","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Degradation","Diversity methods","Computer errors","Data mining","Decoding","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","error statistics","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward link multiuser STBC-OFDM systems","space-time block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","signal-to-noise power ratio","burst error","bit error rate","BER performance","transmit antennas","subcarrier allocation scheme"]}],"abstract":"In forward link multiuser space-time block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (STBC-OFDM) systems, the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) of each user's received signal is different from those of others. Thus, when subcarriers are not properly allocated to users, intensive bit errors occur in a specific user. This causes a burst error in such a user, and the number of correctable bits decreases. As a result, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the overall system is degraded. In this paper, we propose a space-time coding scheme which distributes bit errors among users. In our coding scheme, by letting several users share a subcarrier, bit errors are distributed among users. Therefore, our coding scheme prevents the occurrence of intensive bit errors. Simulation results show that the BER performance of the system using our coding scheme with two or three transmit antennas is better than that of the system with the conventional coding scheme even when proper subcarrier allocation schemes are not employed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Coding Scheme for Forward Link Multiuser STBC-OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360727","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360727.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Coding Scheme for Forward Link Multiuser STBC-OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360727/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036816","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Coding Scheme for Forward Link Multiuser STBC-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04588S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5360728,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An efficient use of radio resources shall be based on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) to adjust the modulation order and MIMO transmission mode. A new suboptimal algorithm is proposed for link adaptation in a MIMO-OFDMA cellular system under spatially correlated fading and imperfect CSIT due to user mobility. Performance results are provided for the proposed solution under a long term evolution (LTE) downlink scenario. A substantial spectral efficiency gain is observed in contrast to the standalone transmission schemes.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360728","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360728.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Adaptive Modulation and MIMO Transmission for Non-Ideal OFDMA Cellular Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Adaptive Modulation and MIMO Transmission for Non-Ideal OFDMA Cellular Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360728/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036817","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360728/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Adaptive Modulation and MIMO Transmission for Non-Ideal OFDMA Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048767S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360729,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Ellenbeck","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Ellenbeck","id":"37681708000"},{"name":"Johannes Schmidt","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37669056200"},{"name":"Ulrike Korger","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrike","lastName":"Korger","id":"37600283900"},{"name":"Christian Hartmann","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Hartmann","id":"37268285100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5626-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5625-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5360729","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Processor scheduling","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Computational complexity","Performance gain","Scheduling algorithm","Communication networks","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient system-level simulations","packet-based OFDMA cellular networks","proportional fair fast scheduling","orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","frequency selective fast fading channels","time selective fast fading channels","channel-adaptive scheduling","multicellular system","efficient mapping technique","post-scheduling SINR gain","link level simulations","long term evolution system","LTE system"]}],"abstract":"System-level simulations of packet-based orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular networks require a proper consideration of the channel-dependent fast fading/scheduling in order to produce meaningful results. However, generating the time and frequency selective fast fading channels and performing detailed channel-adaptive scheduling for each user in a multi-cellular system is computationally too expensive in most system-level simulations. To this end, we propose an efficient mapping technique that allows to accurately characterize the performance of the fast-scheduling system using two parameters: the average effective post-scheduling SINR gain and the ratio of allocated resources, both conditioned on the SINR and the velocity of a user in a scenario defined by the number of co-scheduled users. To derive these parameters for different numbers of users at different velocities and SINR levels, we perform detailed link level simulations including fast scheduling for the downlink of a long term evolution (LTE) system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Concept for Efficient System-Level Simulations of OFDMA Systems with Proportional Fair Fast Scheduling","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360729","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Concept for Efficient System-Level Simulations of OFDMA Systems with Proportional Fair Fast Scheduling","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360729/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036818","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Concept for Efficient System-Level Simulations of OFDMA Systems with Proportional Fair Fast Scheduling","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083154S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5360730,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Hosein","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Hosein","id":"37269132200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5626-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5625-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5360730","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":1870},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Wireless networks","Long Term Evolution","Standards development","Standards organizations","Next generation networking","Measurement","Bandwidth","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio networks","resource allocation","telecommunication standards","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","LTE","long term evolution","physical downlink control channel","wireless networks","user equipment","wireless standard"]}],"abstract":"The next generation of wireless networks will simultaneously support any data and voice users. These users or UEs (User Equipment) will share the uplink and downlink radio resources and so, in each frame, the basestation must signal which UEs are being allocated resources and the location within the frame of the associated data. In the case of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless standard, this signalling is performed over the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). The amount of resources allocated to the PDCCH can be varied. However, if the allocated amount is too small then the uplink and downlink data schedulers will not be able to schedule all UEs that need to be served but if the allocated amount is too large then resources that could have been used for transmitting data are wasted. Two issues must therefore be addressed, the determination of the number of resources to be allocated to the PDCCH and, given this allocation, how should UEs be efficiently signalled over the PDCCH. Our focus in this paper is on the second issue but we also briefly address how one can approach the first issue. We propose a simple but near optimal algorithm for making PDCCH allocations within the subset of resources reserved for its use. We then illustrate, through simulations, the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360730","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360730.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for the LTE Physical Downlink Control Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for the LTE Physical Downlink Control Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360730/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036731","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360730/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for the LTE Physical Downlink Control Channel","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029974S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360733,"authors":[{"name":"Debarati Sen","affiliation":["SAIT India Laboratory, Samsung Electronics Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Debarati","lastName":"Sen","id":"37301984700"},{"name":"Saswat Chakrabarti","affiliation":["G.

While this technique has been widely utilized in wireless networks, recent studies have proposed to exploit sleep mode in wired networks to conserve energy as well. This paper focuses on some feasible implementations of sleep mode in passive optical networks (PONs). In particular, ONU sleep mode is considered. The paper first outlines the ONU wake-up process using current time division multiplexing (TDM) PON protocols. Current and novel optical network unit (ONU) architectures that selectively switch-off some elements are then described. Their advantages in terms of energy savings are analytically computed under different traffic scenarios. Using the proposed architectures, analytical results show more than 50% energy saving under realistic TDM traffic. Finally, possible drawbacks in terms of new scheduling challenges are also discussed and potential solutions are presented.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360736","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sleep Mode for Energy Saving PONs: Advantages and Drawbacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360736/","displayDocTitle":"Sleep Mode for Energy Saving PONs: Advantages and Drawbacks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036736","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360736/","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sleep Mode for Energy Saving PONs: Advantages and Drawbacks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"09-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085975S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5360737,"authors":[{"name":"Sudharman K.

DSL allows the primary users to actively encourage, or discourage, secondary access depending on their instantaneous Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements and affordable power constraints. Secondary users, on the other hand, attempt to maximize throughput, or any other suitably chosen reward function, opportunistically, while not violating the interference limit set by the primary users. In this paper, we have proposed further generalization to the primary user utility function defined and a new utility function for the secondary users. We establish the conditions on the primary and secondary user utility functions so that the DSL game has desired equilibrium properties.

The simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform the conventional methods in terms of received video qualities and users' fairness.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360738","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360738.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-Driven Cross-Layer Approaches to Video Transmission over Downlink OFDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360738/","displayDocTitle":"Application-Driven Cross-Layer Approaches to Video Transmission over Downlink OFDMA Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036738","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360738/","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Driven Cross-Layer Approaches to Video Transmission over Downlink OFDMA Networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"04-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068945S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-18"},{"_id":5360741,"authors":[{"name":"Albrecht J.

By applying channel state information in the transmitter (CSIT), the base station (BS) is able to spatially multiplex downlink data streams for different users. In the time division duplex (TDD) mode, CSIT for the BS is provided by means of uplink CSI sounding pilots. However, antenna-specific uplink pilot streams cause an extensive overhead that restricts the size of the practical user group and the terminal antenna setup that can be handled within the same time-frequency slot. We propose to reduce the required overhead by letting the terminals form pilot beams by transmit precoding, based on the knowledge of the user-specific MIMO channels obtained via a downlink common pilot signal. The achievable rate of the system is evaluated in conjunction with channel estimation and linear receivers. According to the results, the performance loss induced by the incomplete sounding is minor, as the beamforming gain provided by multiple terminal antennas, and the multiuser diversity seen by the BS are retained. When taking into account the CSI estimation error in the BS, the overhead reduction turns out to improve robustness and even increase the average system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360756","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Sounding Pilot Overhead Reduction for TDD Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Sounding Pilot Overhead Reduction for TDD Multiuser MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360756/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036752","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360756/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Sounding Pilot Overhead Reduction for TDD Multiuser MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055752S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360758,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

The optimal user scheduling involves an exhaustive search, which becomes very complex for realistic numbers of users and transmit antennas. Among various suboptimal but low complexity algorithms, greedy algorithms with heuristic scheduling metrics have been shown to achieve performance close to an exhaustive search. Meanwhile, genetic algorithms (GAs) are a rapid, though suboptimal, option of performing a utility (in this case scheduling) metric optimization. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance and complexity of greedy and genetic scheduling algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with successive zero-forcing preceding. We demonstrate that at lower K, the genetic algorithm performs better than the greedy algorithm, where K denotes the total number of users requesting service. For large K, however, the greedy algorithm outperforms the genetic algorithm. The greedy algorithm also achieves similar sum-rate growth (with K) as the exhaustive search. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the order of complexity of the genetic algorithm is higher than that of the greedy algorithm by a factor equal to K\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, where K\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n denotes the maximum number of simultaneously served multiple-antenna users.

The concept of cognitive radio is also exploited in the railway context in order to satisfy high availability and interoperability of wireless telecommunication systems everywhere as required by operational or safety applications deployed by the railway operator. It allows for example dynamic spectrum allocation versus QoS (Quality of service) or traffic requirements and very often spectrum reuse especially in rural areas. Blind multi-carrier transmission recognition methods based on the discrimination between single-carrier and multi-carrier modulations to estimate their parameters have been addressed in the literature. Some powerful techniques use autocorrelation and cyclic autocorrelation based features of the transmitted signal. In this paper, we propose a blind parameter estimation based on analysis of fluctuations of autocorrelation estimators which was initially employed in CDMA signals interception. The proposed technique leads to a fast efficient parameters estimation and is insensitive to receiver phase and frequency offsets as it is highlighted in simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind MC-DS-CDMA Parameters Estimation in Frequency Selective Channels","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360761","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360761.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind MC-DS-CDMA Parameters Estimation in Frequency Selective Channels","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360761/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036756","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind MC-DS-CDMA Parameters Estimation in Frequency Selective Channels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079587S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360765,"authors":[{"name":"Wessam Mesbah","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Mesbah","id":"37392290200"},{"name":"Hussein Alnuweiri","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Alnuweiri","id":"37269837800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5626-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5625-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5360765","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Time sharing computer systems","Mean square error methods","Interference cancellation","Receiving antennas","Multiple access interference","Channel capacity","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-access multiple-input-multiple-output system","minimum mean square error successive interference cancellation","MMSE-SIC receiver","spatial multiplexing","decoding order optimization","convex optimization","time-sharing"]}],"abstract":"We consider a multiple-access multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with minimum mean square error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receiver.

We show that the best-effort users can achieve higher rates when the data streams of any user are not restricted to be decoded in a consecutive order and when time-sharing between different decoding orders is allowed. Two scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, we assume that the power transmitted from each antenna is fixed, and hence the optimization is done over rate and decoding order only. In the second scenario, the optimization is done jointly over rate, power, and decoding order. We show that in both scenarios the problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, and hence efficient algorithms can be used to obtain the globally optimal solution. We also show that in some cases it is possible to reduce the power required to obtain the optimal solution, and we show that the power minimization problem is convex. We also propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a sufficient set of decoding orders (corner points) and time-sharing factors, to obtain the optimal solution.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360765","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Rate, Power, and Decoding Order Optimization of MIMO-MAC with MMSE-SIC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360765/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Rate, Power, and Decoding Order Optimization of MIMO-MAC with MMSE-SIC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036760","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360765/","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Rate, Power, and Decoding Order Optimization of MIMO-MAC with MMSE-SIC","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069065S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5360766,"authors":[{"name":"Sithamparanathan Kandeepan","affiliation":["Broadband and Wireless Group, Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy","DEIS, WiLab, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Sithamparanathan","lastName":"Kandeepan","id":"37294706400"},{"name":"Andrea Giorgetti","affiliation":["Broadband and Wireless Group, Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy","DEIS, WiLab, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Giorgetti","id":"37268952500"},{"name":"Marco Chiani","affiliation":["Broadband and Wireless Group, Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy","DEIS, WiLab, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Chiani","id":"37268945300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5626-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5625-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5360766","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Cognitive radio","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Pareto analysis","Probability","AWGN","Chromium","Signal to noise ratio","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","cognitive radio","Pareto distribution","Poisson distribution","signal detection","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic spectrum sensing","legacy user detection","noise statistics","cognitive radio","periodic scanning","temporal spectral occupancy statistics","Poisson Pareto burst process","Web service application","additive white Gaussian noise"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider the spectrum sensing performance and requirements for detecting legacy users (LU) in cognitive radios (CR) with periodic scanning.

Theoretical expressions are computed for the detection probabilities, for energy based detection, and we derive expressions for the sensing time requirements to successfully detect the LU based on the temporal and the noise statistics for a given detection criteria.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360766","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360766.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360766","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic Spectrum Sensing Performance and Requirements for Detecting Legacy Users with Temporal and Noise Statistics in Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"Periodic Spectrum Sensing Performance and Requirements for Detecting Legacy Users with Temporal and Noise Statistics in Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360766/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036761","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic Spectrum Sensing Performance and Requirements for Detecting Legacy Users with Temporal and Noise Statistics in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07867S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5360768,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper discusses the feasibility of uplink transmission with the maximum modulation level of 64 QAM, using the measured uplink throughput performances when the maximum modulation levels are quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The field trial results show that 64 QAM improves the uplink throughput performance in 30% of the field trial area. It is considered that the maximum modulation level of 64 QAM is feasible to provide a mobile broadband data communication service with a higher throughput in uplink as well as downlink.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360768.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility Study of Uplink Transmission with 64 QAM Based on Results of MBWA System Field Trial","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5360768/","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility Study of Uplink Transmission with 64 QAM Based on Results of MBWA System Field Trial","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036763","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility Study of Uplink Transmission with 64 QAM Based on Results of MBWA System Field Trial","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05665S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360769,"authors":[{"name":"Esa Piri","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Esa","lastName":"Piri","id":"37392947800"},{"name":"Jarno Pinola","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarno","lastName":"Pinola","id":"37392948500"},{"name":"Ilkka Harjula","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Ilkka","lastName":"Harjula","id":"37332591000"},{"name":"Kostas Pentikousis","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Pentikousis","id":"37271895100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5626-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5625-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5360769","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","MIMO","Telecommunication traffic","Quality of service","Performance gain","Mobile antennas","Antennas and propagation","Testing","Antenna measurements","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","quality of service","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile WiMAX","wireless access technology","3GPP LTE","High Speed Packet Access","UMTS","quality of service support","data propagation reliability","vehicular mobility","TCP traffic"]}],"abstract":"Mobile WiMAX is claimed to have the greatest potential of all wireless access technologies already in the markets with respect to network capacity, range, mobility, and quality of service support. Mobile WiMAX has also adopted MIMO as an essential element for increasing capacity and data propagation reliability. However, there are few publicly available studies demonstrating what is possible with Mobile WiMAX in practice and none that empirically evaluates the performance gains attained with MIMO. We fill this gap by comparing spacetime coding based 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO with single antenna mode in our Mobile WiMAX testbed. We conduct thorough measurements that involve vehicular mobility with different types of traffic. We find that MIMO significantly increases the reliability of data propagation over the wireless link, which is particularly evident when we consider TCP traffic. Since 3GPP LTE, the main rival to Mobile WiMAX, equipment and publicly deployed networks are yet to become available, HSPA and the soon-tobe-deployed HSPA + amendments to UMTS are the only wireless technologies challenging Mobile WiMAX. Thus, we also compare Mobile WiMAX with HSPA, providing the first publicly available side-by-side measurement study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical Evaluation of Mobile WiMAX with MIMO","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360769","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360769.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","displayDocTitle":"Empirical Evaluation of Mobile WiMAX with MIMO","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360769/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036764","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical Evaluation of Mobile WiMAX with MIMO","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059062S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5360771,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["Canberra Research Laboratory, NICTA, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Research School of Information Science and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38184221500"},{"name":"Zhenning Shi","affiliation":["Canberra Research Laboratory, NICTA, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhenning","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278371900"},{"name":"Mark C.

However, the conventional MCMC method suffers from an error floor in the high signal-to-noise (SNR) region. This paper proposes a novel robust reduced-state-space MCMC (RSS-MCMC) method, which utilizes the a priori information for the first time to qualify the reliable decoded bits from the entire signal space. The new robust MCMC method is developed to deal with the unreliable bits by using the reliably decoded bit information to cancel the interference that they generate. The performance comparison shows that the new technique has improved performance compared to the conventional approach, and further complexity reduction can be obtained with the assistance of the a priori information. Furthermore, the complexity and performance tradeoff of the new method can be optimized for practical realizations.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360771","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5360673/5360674/05360771.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reduced-State-Space Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Iterative Spatial Multiplexing MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360771/","displayDocTitle":"A Reduced-State-Space Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Iterative Spatial Multiplexing MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036766","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360771/","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reduced-State-Space Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Iterative Spatial Multiplexing MIMO","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"02-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058286S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5360673","isNumber":"5360674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5360673","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5360674","articleId":"5360771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360813,"authors":[{"name":"Xingkun Xu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Xingkun Xu","id":"37595304100"},{"name":"Tao Qiu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Tao Qiu","id":"37591403200"},{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Wenjun Xu","id":"37404292300"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Zhiqiang He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Kai Niu","id":"37284274700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4898-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5360813","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":439},"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a heuristic algorithm to investigate the performance of resource allocation combined with coordinated multipoint(CoMP) in multi-cell OFDMA systems.

The capacity problems maximize the sum rate of CUs subject to the interference constraint for PUs and total transmitted power constraint can be solved with high complexity.

This results in a severe frequency-selective fading channel. Frequency-domain equalization reception based on the minimum mean square error criterion (called receive MMSE-FDE in this paper) can exploit the channel frequency-selectivity to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of broadband single-carrier (SC) signal transmissions in a severe frequency-selective fading channel. If the channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter side only, transmit MMSE-FDE can be used instead of receive MMSE-FDE. In this paper, we review classical transmit and receive MMSE-FDEs. Then, assuming the perfect knowledge of CSI at both the transmitter and the receiver, we introduce a joint transmit/receive MMSE-FDE that can further improve the BER performance. A set of transmit/receive weights are presented for the joint MMSE-FDE and evaluate the achievable BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2009.5360995","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content","pdfPath":"/iel5/5353577/5360780/05360995.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2009.5360995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5360780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband wireless single-carrier transmission using joint transmit/receive frequency-domain equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5360995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5360995/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband wireless single-carrier transmission using joint transmit/receive frequency-domain equalization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11048771","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5360995/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband wireless single-carrier transmission using joint transmit/receive frequency-domain equalization","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054097S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5353577","isNumber":"5360780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353577","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5360780","articleId":"5360995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5360998,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wei","affiliation":["Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Peng Wei","id":"37087858957"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4898-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"5360998","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frequency","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Interchannel interference","Radiofrequency interference","Power control","Downlink","AWGN","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","frequency allocation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular MIMO system","multiple input multiple output system","uplink cellular capacity framework","co-channel interference","CCI","transmit power control","frequency reuse factors","FRF","TPC schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular MIMO","Uplink capacity"]}],"abstract":"The uplink capacity evaluation of cellular multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system is of great interest but not straight forward.

Compared with the existing algorithm, the proposed SDMCPA-CP can reduce the number of matrix inversions and matrix eigenvalue decompositions significantly, while still provide the optimal balanced SINR level for all the cognitive users. In addition, based on SDMCPA-CP, a two-phase search (TPS) algorithm for the number of antenna is further presented. With TPS algorithm, the minimal number of antenna which satisfies the above two sets of constraints as well as the QoS requirements of all the CUs could be found fast.","doi":"10.1109/ICACIA.2009.5361094","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5356755/5361059/05361094.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACIA.2009.5361094","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","startPage":"306","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity joint beamforming and power control for SINR balancing and number of antenna considerations in cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity joint beamforming and power control for SINR balancing and number of antenna considerations in cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361094/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361094/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11069065","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity joint beamforming and power control for SINR balancing and number of antenna considerations in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053241S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5356755","isNumber":"5361059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5356755","xplore-issue":"5361059","articleId":"5361094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5361109,"authors":[{"name":"Ke-Xin Jia","affiliation":["College of electronic engineering, UESTC, China"],"lastName":"Ke-Xin Jia","id":"37087349267"},{"name":"Zi-Shu He","affiliation":["College of electronic engineering, UESTC, China"],"lastName":"Zi-Shu He","id":"37087350186"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5204-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5206-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5361109","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Statistics","Detectors","Probability","Bandwidth","Statistical analysis","Additive white noise","Helium","Educational institutions","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","radio receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic censored mean level detector","ACML detector","digital channelized receiver","detection performance analysis","additive white Gaussian noise","complex sinusoid signal detection","channel bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital channelized receiver","probability of false alarm","probability of detection","ACML detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361109","doi":"10.1109/ICACIA.2009.5361109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACIA.2009.5361109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361059","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5356755/5361059/05361109.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection performance analysis of the digital channelized receiver-based ACML detector","abstract":"In this paper, the statistic characteristics of the digital channelizied receiver are studied in the context of additive white Gaussian noise.

We consider non-safety applications whose commercial appeal is expected to accelerate the deployment of VANETs. In this case the main objective is to deliver as much information as possible during the connection lifetime of the vehicles, which is limited by their speed and the length of the road sections under coverage. In this environment the contention free poll-based access mechanism of the 802.11e standard included in current VANET specifications is especially suitable. The design of a scheduling mechanism is addressed in this article from a control theory point of view with the additional novelty of using an optimal control formulation comprising resource constraints. This design strategy allows QoS differentiation, assuring a fixed amount of bandwidth for each QoS class. The resulting algorithm not only maximizes the amount of data delivered, but also reduces performance differences between users traveling along different roads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361176/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024397","publicationDate":"December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5361176/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control-based scheduling with QoS support for vehicle to infrastructure communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control-based scheduling with QoS support for vehicle to infrastructure communications","sourcePdf":"009ALCAREZ-ESPINLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039945S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5361167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5361167","articleId":"5361176","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5361219,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cong","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Cong","id":"37276009100"},{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37288834300"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37404908700"},{"name":"Yi Zou","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zou","id":"37672489600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-800-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"5361219","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":380},"abstract":"Hardware acceleration is crucial in modern embedded system design to meet the explosive demands on performance and cost. Selected computation kernels for acceleration are usually captured by nest loops, which are optimized by state-of-the-art techniques like loop tiling and loop pipelining. However, memory bandwidth bottlenecks prevent designs to reach optimal throughput with respect to available parallelism. In this paper we present an automatic memory partitioning technique which can efficiently improve throughput and reduce energy consumption of pipelined loop kernels for given throughput constraints and platform requirement. Our partition scheme consists of two steps, the first step considers cycle accurate scheduling information to meet the hard constraints on memory bandwidth requirements specifically for synchronized hardware designs. Experimental results show an average 6X throughput improvement on a set of real world designs with moderate area increase (about 45% on average), given that less resource sharing opportunities exist with higher throughput in optimized designs. The second step further partitions the memory banks for reducing the dynamic power consumption of the final design. In contrast with previous approaches, our technique can statically compute memory access frequencies in polynomial time with little to none profiling. Experimental results show about 30% power reduction on the same set of benchmarks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361219.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"704","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1145/1687399.1687528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic memory partitioning and scheduling for throughput and power optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Hardware","Acceleration","Kernel","Bandwidth","Energy consumption","Processor scheduling","Embedded system","Explosives","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","optimisation","pipeline processing","power aware computing","power consumption","program control structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic memory partitioning","automatic memory scheduling","throughput optimization","power optimization","hardware acceleration","embedded system design","computation kernels","nest loops","state-of the art techniques","loop tiling","loop pipelining","memory bandwidth bottlenecks","cycle accurate scheduling information","synchronized hardware designs","resource sharing opportunities","dynamic power consumption","memory access frequencies","polynomial time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioral Synthesis","Memory Partition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatic memory partitioning and scheduling for throughput and power optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361219/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035414","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic memory partitioning and scheduling for throughput and power optimization","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066309S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5361221,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cong","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Cong","id":"37276009100"},{"name":"Yi Zou","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zou","id":"37672489600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-800-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"5361221","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":177},"abstract":"GPU platforms are becoming increasingly attractive for implementing accelerators because they feature a larger number of cores with improved programmability.

These TSVs occupy non-negligible silicon area because of their sheer size. This significant silicon area occupied by the TSVs and the interconnections made to the TSVs greatly affect area, power, performance, and reliability of 3D IC layouts. Well-managed TSVs alleviate congestion, reduce wirelength, and improve performance, whereas excessive TSVs not only increase the die area, but also have negative impact on many design objectives. In this paper, we study the impact of TSV on various aspects of 3D layouts. We use GDSII layouts of 2D and 3D designs, and thoroughly compare the pros and cons of TSV usage. We propose a new force-directed 3D gate-level placement that efficiently handles TSVs. In addition, we present an algorithm that assigns TSVs to nets to complete routing that involves TSVs. This algorithm, together with our 3D placer, is integrated into a commercial P&R tool to generate fully validated GDSII layouts. Our experiments based on synthesized benchmarks indicate that our algorithms help generate GDSII layouts of 3D designs that are optimized in terms of area, wirelength, and metal layer count.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of Through-Silicon-Via impact on the 3D stacked IC layout","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361224.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A study of Through-Silicon-Via impact on the 3D stacked IC layout","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361224/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of Through-Silicon-Via impact on the 3D stacked IC layout","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073378S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5361227,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish K.

These constraints determine both the minimum cell size and supply voltage. RCM is set by the maximum read access time over the array. The randomness of transistor threshold voltages, and thus read times, makes maximum read time follow extreme order statistics, specifically, the Gumbel distribution which is characterized by long tails. Thus, the margin specification needs to be met at the high sigma corners in order to reach acceptable yield, resulting in oversizing and increased VDD. In this work, we demonstrate that a reduced-area bitcell design is achievable by reducing the impact of intra-array randomness through a new architecture that employs an adaptive voltage scheme in a partitioned SRAM array. The key idea is to be able to shift empirical distributions (realizations) of read time in a set of rows that form a single partition to meet the target. Because the partition is smaller than the whole array, the tail of the Gumbel distribution is significantly reduced. The adaptive voltage tuning policy is driven by the worst partition access time. For the blocks whose delay violates access time constraints, a higher voltage is selected out of the available set to gain yield, otherwise voltage is reduced for power saving. This permits smaller cell area and lower V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n at identical yield. The cost of adaptivity is in generation and routing of a small number (in our experiments, four) voltage levels and the area of one-per-partition set of PMOS switches. We demonstrate that through the voltage tuning architecture we propose, it is possible to obtain mean power consumption reduction on average by 21% iso-area. Alternatively, bitcell area can be reduced on average by 7% iso-power compared to the existing design strategy.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361227.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of intra-array SRAM variability using adaptive voltage architecture","doi":"10.1145/1687399.1687517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of intra-array SRAM variability using adaptive voltage architecture","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035419","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5361227/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of intra-array SRAM variability using adaptive voltage architecture","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10164S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5361230,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Bansal","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

A robust power management technique must be able to learn the optimal decision from past history and improve itself as the environment changes. This paper presents a novel online power management technique based on model-free constrained reinforcement learning (RL). It learns the best power management policy that gives the minimum power consumption for a given performance constraint without any prior information of workload. Compared with existing machine learning based power management techniques, the RL based learning is capable of exploring the trade-off in the power-performance design space and converging to a better power management policy.

Instead of viewing nano-scale characteristics as an impediment, technologies such as PCMOS exploit them as a source of randomness. The technology generates random numbers that are used in probabilistic algorithms. With the PCMOS approach, different voltage levels are used to generate different probability values. If many different probability values are required, this approach becomes prohibitively expensive. In this work, we demonstrate a novel technique for synthesizing logic that generates new probabilities from a given set of probabilities. Three different scenarios are considered in terms of whether the given probabilities can be duplicated and whether there is freedom to choose them. In the case that the given probabilities cannot be duplicated and are predetermined, we provide a solution that is FPGA-mappable. In the case that the given probabilities cannot be duplicated but can be freely chosen, we provide an optimal choice. In the case that the given probabilities can be duplicated and can be freely chosen, we demonstrate how to generate arbitrary decimal probabilities from small sets - a single probability or a pair of probabilities - through combinational logic.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361265","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361265.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","startPage":"367","endPage":"374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The synthesis of combinational logic to generate probabilities","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5361265/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035441","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The synthesis of combinational logic to generate probabilities","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099613S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5361267,"authors":[{"name":"Jarrod A.

Combining placement and routing into a joint optimization has also been proposed. However, it remains unclear if the benefits would be significant enough to justify major changes in commercial tools. CRISP addresses this challenge and is the first tool to demonstrate tangible benefits of combined place-and-route optimization including fewer global routing detours, reduced detailed routing violations and runtime, and even shrinking the floorplan of a commercial design.

Thermal modeling for microchannel cooling is challenging due to its complicated thermal-wake effect, a localized temperature wake phenomenon downstream of a heated source in the flow. This paper presents a fast and accurate thermal-wake aware thermal model for integrated microchannel 3D ICs. Validation results show the proposed thermal model achieves more than 400\u00d7 speed up and only 2.0% error in comparison with a commercial numerical simulation tool. We also demonstrate the use of the proposed thermal model for thermal optimization during the IC placement stage. We find that due to the thermal-wake effect, tiles are placed in the descending order of power magnitude along the flow direction. We also find that modeling thermal-wakes is critical for generating a thermal-aware placement for integrated microchannel-cooled 3D IC. It could result in up to 25\u00b0C peak temperature difference according to our experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361284.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"263","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1145/1687399.1687447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal modeling for 3D-ICs with integrated microchannel cooling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Microchannel","Cooling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","integrated circuit design","microchannel flow","thermal analysis","thermal management (packaging)","three-dimensional integrated circuits","wakes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal modeling","3D integrated circuit","integrated microchannel cooling","integrated microchannel liquid cooling technology","thermal wake aware thermal model","thermal aware placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microchannel","Liquid-cooling","3D-ICs","Thermal-wakes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Thermal modeling for 3D-ICs with integrated microchannel cooling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361284/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11024730","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal modeling for 3D-ICs with integrated microchannel cooling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102433S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5361285,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Wei Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Wei","lastName":"Lee","id":"37593737800"},{"name":"Chung-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291389700"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279580700"},{"name":"Chin-Fang Shen","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Fang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37671246000"},{"name":"Wei-Chih Tseng","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei-Chih","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37672884800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-800-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"5361285","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Algorithm design and analysis","Tiles","Integrated circuit packaging","Wires","Driver circuits","Integer linear programming","Design engineering","Electronics packaging","Isolators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-chip devices","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-assignment routing algorithm","flip-chip designs","flip-chip package","integrated circuit designs","driver pads","bump pads","weighted longest common subsequence","maximum planar subset of chords","pre-assignment flip-chips","constant-time routability analyzer","integer linear programming"]}],"abstract":"The flip-chip package is introduced for modern IC designs with higher integration density and larger I/O counts. In this paper, we consider the pre-assignment flip-chip routing problem with predefined connections between driver pads and bump pads. This problem has been shown to be much more difficult than the free-assignment one, but is more popular in real-world designs because the connections between driver pads and bump pads are typically pre-determined by IC or packaging designers. Based on the concept of routing sequence exchange, we propose a very efficient global routing algorithm by computing the weighted longest common subsequence (WLCS) and the maximum planar subset of chords (MPSC) for pre-assignment flip-chips. We observe that the existing work over constrains the capacity of a routing tile, which might miss some critical solution space with a better routing solution (e.g., smaller wirelength), and provide a remedy for this insufficiency to identify a better solution in a more complete solution space. We also develop a constant-time routability analyzer to check if a given set of wires can pass through a tile. Experimental results show that our router can achieve a 122\u00d7 speedup with even better solution quality (same routability with slightly smaller wire-length), compared with a state-of-the-art flip-chip router based on integer linear programming (ILP).","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361285.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient pre-assignment routing algorithm for flip-chip designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361285/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient pre-assignment routing algorithm for flip-chip designs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035456","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361285/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient pre-assignment routing algorithm for flip-chip designs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052417S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5361292,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjing Li","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Yanjing","lastName":"Li","id":"37405719600"},{"name":"Onur Mutlu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Mutlu","id":"37265510200"},{"name":"Subhasish Mitra","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Subhasish","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37276204700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-800-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"5361292","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operating systems","Built-in self-test","Robustness","Processor scheduling","Degradation","Computer applications","Application software","Delay","Transistors","Aging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","operating systems (computers)","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operating system scheduling","online self-test","robust systems","early-life failures","transistor aging","dual quad-core system","software support","OS scheduling techniques","multicore systems","performance degradation","perceptible delays","computation-intensive applications"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operating system scheduling for efficient online self-test in robust systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361292.pdf","startPage":"201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361292","abstract":"Very thorough online self-test is essential for overcoming major reliability challenges such as early-life failures and transistor aging in advanced technologies.

Experimental data from an actual dual quad-core system demonstrate that, without software support, online self-test can significantly degrade performance of soft real-time and computation-intensive applications (by up to 190%), and can result in perceptible delays for interactive applications. To mitigate these problems, we develop OS scheduling techniques that are aware of online self-test, and schedule/migrate tasks in multi-core systems by taking into account the unavailability of one or more cores undergoing online self-test. These techniques eliminate any performance degradation and perceptible delays in soft real-time and interactive applications (otherwise introduced by online self-test), and significantly reduce the impact of online self-test on the performance of computation-intensive applications. Our techniques require minor modifications to existing OS schedulers, thereby enabling practical and efficient online self-test in real systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11035461","htmlLink":"/document/5361292/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Operating system scheduling for efficient online self-test in robust systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operating system scheduling for efficient online self-test in robust systems","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072927S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5361293,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37293147200"},{"name":"Dean L.

The overall yield of 3D ICs improves with pre-bond testability because designers can avoid stacking defective dies with good ones. However, pre-bond testability presents unique challenges to 3D clock tree design. First, each die needs a complete 2D clock tree for the pre-bond testing. In addition, the entire 3D stack needs a complete 3D clock tree for post-bond testing and normal operations. In the case of two-die stack, a straightforward solution is to have two complete 2D clock trees connected with a single Through-Silicon-Via (TSV). We show that this solution suffers from long wirelength and high clock power consumption. Instead, our algorithm minimizes the overall wirelength and clock power consumption while providing the pre-bond testability and post-bond operability under given skew and slew constraints. Compared with the single-TSV solution, SPICE simulation results show that our multi-TSV approach significantly reduces the clock power by up to 15.9% for two-die and 29.7% for four-die stack. In addition, the wirelength reduction is up to 24.4% and 42.0%.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361293.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-bond testable low-power clock tree design for 3D stacked ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361293/","displayDocTitle":"Pre-bond testable low-power clock tree design for 3D stacked ICs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11024733","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361293/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-bond testable low-power clock tree design for 3D stacked ICs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066059S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5361294,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Li","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37088448051"},{"name":"Qiang Xu","affiliation":["CAS-CUHK Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Integration Technology","Deotartment of CS&E, The Chinese University of Honz Kong, Shatin, N.T, Hong Kong","CAS-CUHK Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Integration Technology, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277384200"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Dcprartmcnt of ECE, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"},{"name":"T.

This trend leads to potential vulnerabilities from untrusted circuit foundries to covertly implant malicious hardware trojans into a genuine design. Hardware trojans provide back doors for on-chip manipulation, or leak secret information off-chip once the compromised IC is deployed in the field. This paper explores the design space of hardware Trojans and proposes a novel technique, \u00bfMalicious Off-chip Leakage Enabled by Side-channels\u00bf (MOLES), which employs power side-channels to convey secret information off-chip. An experimental MOLES circuit is designed with fewer than 50 gates and is embedded into an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic circuit in a predictive 45 nm CMOS technology model. Engineered by a spread-spectrum technique, the MOLES technique is capable of leaking multi-bit information below the noise power level of the host IC to evade evaluators' detections. In addition, a generalized methodology for a class of MOLES circuits and design verification by statistical correlation analysis are presented. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the potential threats of MOLES on embedded system security. Nevertheless, MOLES could be constructively used for hardware authentication, fingerprinting and IP protection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361303.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","startPage":"117","endPage":"122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOLES: Malicious off-chip leakage enabled by side-channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"MOLES: Malicious off-chip leakage enabled by side-channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361303/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035470","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOLES: Malicious off-chip leakage enabled by side-channels","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096705S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5361304,"authors":[{"name":"Yousra Alkabani","affiliation":["CS Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yousra","lastName":"Alkabani","id":"37541507200"},{"name":"Farinaz Koushanfar","affiliation":["ECE and CS Dept(s)., Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Farinaz","lastName":"Koushanfar","id":"37284705800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-800-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"5361304","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","CMOS technology","Business","Fabrication","Testing","Calibration","Integrated circuit modeling","Semiconductor device modeling","Foundries","Permission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current measurement","integrated circuit measurement","integrated circuit testing","invasive software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consistency-based characterization","IC Trojan detection","Trojan attack","nonintrusive external IC quiescent current measurements","consistency metric"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistency-based characterization for IC Trojan detection","doi":"10.1145/1687399.1687426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687426","startPage":"123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361304","abstract":"A Trojan attack maliciously modifies, alters, or embeds unplanned components inside the exploited chips.

Experimental evaluations on standard benchmark designs show the validity of the metric, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the new Trojan detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024735","htmlLink":"/document/5361304/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Consistency-based characterization for IC Trojan detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistency-based characterization for IC Trojan detection","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117925S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5361306,"authors":[{"name":"Rajat Subhra Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engg. and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Rajat Subhra","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37529667700"},{"name":"Swarup Bhunia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engg. and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Swarup","lastName":"Bhunia","id":"37274842700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-800-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"5361306","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Information security","Protection","National security","State-space methods","Circuit simulation","Circuit testing","Permission","Computational modeling","Logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","integrated circuit design","invasive software","monolithic integrated circuits","national security","safety-critical software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security","malicious hardware Trojan","design obfuscation","safety-critical applications","state transition function","reachable state space","internal circuit nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design obfuscation","hardware security","hardware Trojan"]}],"abstract":"Malicious hardware Trojan circuitry inserted in safety-critical applications is a major threat to national security. In this work, we propose a novel application of a key-based obfuscation technique to achieve security against hardware Trojans. The obfuscation scheme is based on modifying the state transition function of a given circuit by expanding its reachable state space and enabling it to operate in two distinct modes - the normal mode and the obfuscated mode. Such a modification obfuscates the rareness of the internal circuit nodes, thus making it difficult for an adversary to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. It also makes some inserted Trojans benign by making them activate only in the obfuscated mode. The combined effect leads to higher Trojan detectability and higher level of protection against such attack. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security at modest design overhead.","doi":"10.1145/1687399.1687424","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361306.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security against hardware Trojan through a novel application of design obfuscation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361306/","displayDocTitle":"Security against hardware Trojan through a novel application of design obfuscation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361306/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035472","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security against hardware Trojan through a novel application of design obfuscation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04128S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5361308,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Feng","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278816400"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277450900"},{"name":"Lei He","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"He","id":"37269852200"},{"name":"Rupak Majumdar","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Rupak","lastName":"Majumdar","id":"37271759200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-800-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"5361308","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intellectual property","Field programmable gate arrays","Fault tolerance","Circuit faults","Logic circuits","Network topology","Circuit topology","Table lookup","Reconfigurable logic","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IPR","in-place reconfiguration","LUT-based FPGAs","fault-tolerant logic resynthesis algorithm","LUT- based logic network","Berkeley ABC","ROSE","academic technology mapper"]}],"abstract":"We describe In-Place Reconfiguration (IPR) for LUT-based FPGAs, an algorithm that maximizes identical configuration bits for complementary inputs of a LUT thereby reducing the propagation of faults seen at a pair of complementary inputs.

In this paper, we present a new scheme for runtime energy minimization (REMiS) as part of a dynamically recon-figurable processor that is exposed to run-time varying constraints like performance and footprint (i.e. amount of reconfigurable fabric). The scheme chooses an energy-minimizing set of so-called Special Instructions (considering leakage, dynamic, and reconfiguration energy) and then 'power-gates' a temporarily unused subset of the Special Instruction set. We provide a comprehensive evaluation for different technologies (ranging from 65 nm to 150 nm) and thereby show that our scheme is technology independent, i.e. it is beneficial for various technologies alike. By means of an H.264 video encoder we demonstrate that for certain performance constraints our scheme (applied to our in-house reconfigurable processor) achieves an allover energy saving of up to 40.8% (avg. 24.8%) compared to a performance-maximizing scheme. We also demonstrate that our scheme is equally beneficial to various other state-of-the-art reconfigurable processor architectures like Molen where it achieves energy savings of up to 48.7% (avg. 28.93%) at 65 nm. We have employed an H.264 encoder within this paper as an application in order to demonstrate the strengths of our scheme, since the H.264's complexity and run-time unpredictability present a challenging scenario for state-of-the-art architectures.","doi":"10.1145/1687399.1687411","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357317/5361202/05361316.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REMiS: Run-time energy minimization scheme in a reconfigurable processor with dynamic power-gated instruction set","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361316/","displayDocTitle":"REMiS: Run-time energy minimization scheme in a reconfigurable processor with dynamic power-gated instruction set","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035481","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361316/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REMiS: Run-time energy minimization scheme in a reconfigurable processor with dynamic power-gated instruction set","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11336S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357317","isNumber":"5361202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357317","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5361202","articleId":"5361316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5361319,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Li","id":"37677472400"},{"name":"Zaichen Qian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zaichen","lastName":"Qian","id":"37595608000"},{"name":"Evangeline F.

For example, design issues such as beam shaping and control, sidelobe levels, bandwidth and many others have been addressed with such concepts. In this paper, mathematical constructs based on the raised power series (RPS) are utilized to provide easily controlled aperiodicity to a linear array of antenna elements in order to achieve wideband performance. In addition, recursive application of raised power series subarrays and implementation of an optimization technique based on the genetic algorithm is demonstrated to realize impressive ultrawideband performance. The technique introduced here is shown to offer bandwidths of many octaves with excellent sidelobe suppression and no grating lobes. Moreover, the ultrawideband performance for one of the optimized RPS array examples is verified through full-wave simulations which take into account the coupling environment experienced by realistic radiating elements (in this case half-wave dipole antennas for three different operating frequencies).","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2039315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5423254/05361328.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2039315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawideband Aperiodic Antenna Arrays Based on Optimized Raised Power Series Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361328/","displayDocTitle":"Ultrawideband Aperiodic Antenna Arrays Based on Optimized Raised Power Series Representations","volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11152820","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361328/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrawideband Aperiodic Antenna Arrays Based on Optimized Raised Power Series Representations","sourcePdf":"tap-werner-2039315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0961S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5423254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5423254","articleId":"5361328","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361329,"authors":[{"name":"Richard G.

Furthermore, the imaging formulation for our method is developed through a Fourier integral processing, and the parameters of antenna array including the cross-range resolution, required size, and sampling interval are also examined. Different from the spatial sequential procedure sampling the scattered echoes during multiple snapshot illuminations in inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging, the proposed method utilizes a spatial parallel procedure to sample the scattered echoes during a single snapshot illumination. Consequently, the complex motion compensation in ISAR imaging can be avoided. Moreover, in our array configuration, multiple narrowband spectrum-shared waveforms coded with orthogonal polyphase sequences are employed. The mainlobes of the compressed echoes from the different filter band could be located in the same range bin, and thus, the range alignment in classical ISAR imaging is not necessary.

The main idea is to design the digital circuits to obtain a periodic supply current with the same period as the clock. This property locates the frequency components of the switching noise above the clock frequency. Differential return-to-zero signaling is used to reduce the data-dependency of the current. Circuits are implemented in symmetrical precharged DCVS logic with internally asynchronous D registers. A chip was fabricated in a standard 130-nm CMOS technology holding two versions of a pipelined 16-bit adder. First version employed the proposed method, and second version used conventional static CMOS logic circuits and TSPC registers. The respective device counts are 1190 and 684, and maximal operating frequencies 450 and 375 MHz. Frequency domain measurements were performed at the substrate node with on-chip generated sinusoidal and pseudo-random data at a clock frequency of 300 MHz. The sinusoidal case resulted in the largest frequency components, where an 8.5 dB/Hz decrease in maximal power is measured for the proposed circuitry at a cost of three times larger power consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11341223","htmlLink":"/document/5361350/","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Substrate Noise in Sub Clock Frequency Range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Substrate Noise in Sub Clock Frequency Range","sourcePdf":"57tcsi07-ebackenius-2031749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086563S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5482395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5482395","articleId":"5361350","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361351,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Cheng Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5545511/5361351/5361351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Cheng Tseng (S'90-M'95-SM'01) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1965.

First, the reconstruction formula of derivative sampling method is applied to design wideband fractional delay filter by using index substitution and window method. The filter coefficients are easily computed because closed-form design is obtained. Then, the weighted least squares method is used to design fixed and variable wideband fractional delay filters. Finally, numerical examples are demonstrated to show that the proposed method has smaller design error than the conventional fractional delay filter without sampling the derivative of signal.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Delay","Sampling methods","Finite impulse response filter","Frequency response","Least squares methods","Design methodology","Signal sampling","Band pass filters","Digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay filters","digital filters","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband fractional delay filters","derivative sampling method","index substitution","window method","weighted least squares method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Derivative sampling","digital filter","fractional delay","weighted least squares (WLS)","wideband"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2037451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5545511/05361351.pdf","startPage":"2087","endPage":"2098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5545511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2037451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Wideband Fractional Delay Filters Using Derivative Sampling Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Wideband Fractional Delay Filters Using Derivative Sampling Method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361351/","volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361351/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11464063","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Wideband Fractional Delay Filters Using Derivative Sampling Method","sourcePdf":"57tcsi09-ctseng-2037451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077106S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5545511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5545511","articleId":"5361351","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5361352,"authors":[{"name":"Qianli Mu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5512812/5361352/5361352-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qianli Mu (S\u201902) received the B.S. degree from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2005 and 2009, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently with TriQuint Semiconductor, Boulder, CO.

The system employs an instrumented elastic circular cuff, wrapped around a blood vessel, for real-time blood pressure monitoring. The elastic circular cuff is made of soft bio-compatible silicone material, which is filled with bio-compatible insulating fluid with an immersed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensor and integrated electronic system to detect a down-scaled vessel blood pressure waveform. This technique avoids vessel penetration and substantially minimizes vessel restriction due to the soft cuff elasticity, thus attractive for long-term monitoring. A large-model engineering experiment is first developed to verify and demonstrate the concept. A miniature prototype monitoring cuff is then fabricated and implanted in two laboratory rats to evaluate its functionality.

Consequently, the minimization of the number of sensors is of great importance in practice. However, relatively fewer research works have been reported on the later. In this paper, a novel optimization method is proposed to address this issue. In the proposed method, the improved genetic algorithm that has been presented at a conference recently, is used to optimize the weight coefficients and sensor positions of the array. Sensors that contribute the least to the array performance are then removed systematically until the smallest acceptable number of sensors is obtained. Specifically, this paper reports the study on the relationship between the peak sidelobe level and the sensor weights, and uses the later to select the sensors to be removed. Through this approach, the desired beam pattern can be synthesized using the smallest number of sensors efficiently. Numerical results show that the proposed sensor removal method is able to achieve good sidelobe suppression with a smaller number of sensors compared to other existing algorithms. The computational load required by our proposed approach is about one order less than that required by other existing algorithms too.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Sparse Array Synthesis With Minimum Number of Sensors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2039292","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5423254/05361379.pdf","startPage":"720","endPage":"726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2039292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Linear Sparse Array Synthesis With Minimum Number of Sensors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5361379/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11152801","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Sparse Array Synthesis With Minimum Number of Sensors","sourcePdf":"tap-lcen-2039292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109898S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5423254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5423254","articleId":"5361379","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361381,"authors":[{"name":"David Gibbins","affiliation":["Centre of Communications Research, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5423254/5361381/5361381-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Gibbins received the M.Eng. degree (first class honors) in aerospace engineering from Liverpool University, Liverpool, U.K., in 2004.","He joined the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 2005 where he is working toward the Ph.D. degree and is a Research Assistant in the Centre for Communications Research where he is a member of Bristol's Breast Cancer Imaging Project.

For angles up to 60\u00b0 away from bore-sight radiated pulses are almost identical (fidelity >95%), whereas for the patch antenna fidelity falls to 58% at the angular extremes.

The utilized objective function comprises four factors as total harmonic distortion, total size of active power-line conditioners (APLCs), harmonic transmission-line loss, and motor load loss. To evaluate the capability of the proposed method, the IEEE 18-bus test system is employed and investigated in three different cases. These cases are based on the assumption of continuous/discrete and limited/unlimited size for APLCs, requiring the optimization method to solve discrete/nondiscrete nonlinear problems. Therefore, in addition to PSO, an integer nonlinear optimizer (discrete PSO called DPSO) algorithm is also developed. Simulation results are compared with results obtained by genetic algorithm as well as with nonlinear programming (discrete nonlinear programming). It is demonstrated that analytical methods enjoy higher accuracy in smooth objective functions while they are not accurate enough in practical situations where nonsmooth objective functions are involved. If improper initial solutions are provided, achieving optimized results cannot be guaranteed by using analytical approaches. It is also shown that heuristic algorithms due to their randomness characteristics are more useful in practical cases where a number of local minima are present. Simulation results confirmed the capability and effectiveness of the proposed PSO-based algorithm in the allocation and sizing of multiple APLCs in a test power system compared with analytical methods and other heuristic algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5437451/05361392.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2036180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2036180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach for Allocation and Sizing of Multiple Active Power-Line Conditioners","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system harmonics","Propagation losses","System testing","Heuristic algorithms","Power system simulation","Particle swarm optimization","Total harmonic distortion","Transmission lines","Optimization methods","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","integer programming","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation","power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple active power-line conditioners","particle swarm optimization","test power system","total harmonic distortion","harmonic transmission-line loss","motor load loss","IEEE 18-bus test system","optimization method","discrete nonlinear programming","nondiscrete nonlinear problems","integer nonlinear optimizer","genetic algorithm","nonlinear programming","heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active power-line conditioner (APLC)","genetic algorithm (GA)","harmonics","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimization (PSO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach for Allocation and Sizing of Multiple Active Power-Line Conditioners","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5361392/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204470","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach for Allocation and Sizing of Multiple Active Power-Line Conditioners","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-ajalilian-2036180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115506S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5437451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5437451","articleId":"5361392","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361397,"authors":[{"name":"Tengmeng Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Tengmeng Tan (S'09) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering with a minor equivalence in applied mathematics from the University of Calgary, AB, Canada, where he is currently in the process of completing his doctoral dissertation.","His main research interest is in the applied computational electromagnetics and much of his work involves time-domain techniques.","Mr. Tan was awarded an excellent Teaching Assistants Award in 2005, and twice received Honorable Mention at the AP-S/URSI, in 2008 and 2009, respectively."]},"firstName":"Tengmeng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37288934700"},{"name":"Mike Potter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Mike Potter (M'94) received the B.Eng. degree in engineering physics (electrical) from the Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 1992 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada, in 2001.","From 1992 to 199,7 he served as an Officer in the Canadian Navy as a Combat Systems Engineer.

The power fluctuation consisting of the dynamic, short-circuit, and static powers is further investigated. The total power fluctuation for the planar MOSFET circuits is 15.2%, which is substantial in the reliability of circuits and systems. The static power is a minor part of the total power; however, its fluctuation is significant because of the serious fluctuation of the leakage current. For an amplifier circuit, the high-frequency characteristics, the circuit gain, the 3-dB bandwidth, the unity-gain bandwidth power, and the power-added efficiency are explored consequently. Similar to the trend of the cutoff frequency, the PVE and RDF dominate both the device and circuit characteristic fluctuations due to the significant gate-capacitance fluctuations, and the WKF is less important at this simulation scenario. The extensive study assesses the fluctuations on circuit performance and reliability, which can, in turn, be used to optimize nanoscale MOSFETs and circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2036309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5393266/05361404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2036309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393266","startPage":"437","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process-Variation Effect, Metal-Gate Work-Function Fluctuation, and Random-Dopant Fluctuation in Emerging CMOS Technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Process-Variation Effect, Metal-Gate Work-Function Fluctuation, and Random-Dopant Fluctuation in Emerging CMOS Technologies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071265","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5361404/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process-Variation Effect, Metal-Gate Work-Function Fluctuation, and Random-Dopant Fluctuation in Emerging CMOS Technologies","sourcePdf":"ted-li-2036309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098025S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5393266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5393266","articleId":"5361404","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361407,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5361407/5361407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Peng (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree in communications engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, in 2005.

First, we compute the capacity of this channel, assuming noncausal but noisy knowledge at node C of node A's signal. We then compute the achievable rate for a causal cognitive strategy: This achievable rate is derived using a two-phase transmission scheme, in which node C uses a combination of a linear MMSE (LMMSE) estimator and a dirty-paper code, and node D employs a combination of an LMMSE estimator and a partial interference canceler. The achievable rate is studied in two different cases: 1. Node C operates in full-duplex mode, and 2. node C operates in half-duplex mode. To quantify the performance of the proposed strategy, we compute simple lower and upper bounds on the capacity of this channel. Similar to an interference channel, the achievable rate of the cognitive ZIC nonmonotonically varies with the interference. Specifically, the achievable rate first decreases with the channel gain between nodes A and D and then begins to increase beyond a certain threshold. The difference in the achievable rate between full- and half-duplex transmissions is also numerically evaluated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Bounds for a Cognitive MIMO Gaussian Z-Interference Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2039362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05361407.pdf","startPage":"1865","endPage":"1876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2039362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Bounds for a Cognitive MIMO Gaussian Z-Interference Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5361407/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285954","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Bounds for a Cognitive MIMO Gaussian Z-Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"tvt-peng-2039362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097515S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5361407","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361409,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Torabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Torabi (S'02\u2013M'05) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2004.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University.

In this paper, we investigate the combination of different techniques, resulting in user scheduling schemes for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems employing orthogonal space-frequency block coding (OSFBC) over multipath frequency-selective fading channels. Our contribution is a performance analysis framework that evaluates the advantages of employing user scheduling in MIMO-OFDM systems employing OSFBC in conjunction with adaptive modulation schemes. We derive analytical expressions for the average spectral efficiency (ASE), the average bit error rate (BER), the outage probability, and the average channel capacity for different scheduling and adaptive modulation schemes. Discrete-rate and continuous-rate adaptive modulation schemes are employed to increase the spectral efficiency of the system. We assume a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)-based user-selection scheme and the well-known proportional fair scheduling (PFS) scheme. Both full- and limited-feedback channel information scenarios are considered. Using the results obtained from both mathematical expressions and numerical simulations, we compare the presented schemes and show their significant advantages. Finally, the impact of spatial correlation on the performance of the system under study is analyzed and evaluated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2039235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5484898/05361409.pdf","startPage":"2363","endPage":"2379","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2039235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Scheduling Schemes for Rate-Adaptive MIMO OSFBC-OFDM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Scheduling Schemes for Rate-Adaptive MIMO OSFBC-OFDM Systems","volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5361409/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2010","accessionNumber":"11392355","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Scheduling Schemes for Rate-Adaptive MIMO OSFBC-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-haccoun-2039235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092144S","chronDate":"Jun  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5484898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5484898","articleId":"5361409","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5361413,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5423254/5361413/5361413-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Wang (M'08) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), Nanjing, China, in 2002 and 2009.","He is currently a Lecturer at the NUST.

The radio frequency (RF) front-ends of an SU have limited bandwidth for spectrum sensing with the target frequency bands dispersed in a discontinuous manner. This results in the SU having to sense multiple target frequency bands in a short period of time before selecting an appropriate idle channel for transmission. This paper addresses this technical challenge by proposing a selective opportunistic spectrum access (SOSA) scheme. With the aid of statistical data and traffic prediction techniques, our SOSA scheme can estimate the probability of a channel appearing idle based on the statistics and choose the best spectrum-sensing order to maximize spectrum efficiency and maintain an SU's connection. By means of doing so, this SOSA scheme can preserve the QoS of an SU while improving the system efficiency. In contrast to previous work, we consider the practical issues encountered by an SU in a wireless environment, such as discontinuous target frequency bands and limited spectrum-sensing ability. We examine the spectrum-sensing scheme in terms of packet loss ratio (PLR) and throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed SOSA scheme can decrease the probability of packet losses in the discontinuous spectrum environment and improve the spectrum efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","volume":"59","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11285986","publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361432/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Selective Opportunistic Spectrum Access With Traffic Prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Selective Opportunistic Spectrum Access With Traffic Prediction","sourcePdf":"tvt-yuan-2039155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09395S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5361432","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361434,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zhang","affiliation":["Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5361434/5361434-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yonghong Zhang (M'09) received the B.Eng. degree (with honors) in computer science and engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1994 and the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","She has worked in industry in both Canada and China as a Software Engineer.

In such OCDMA network, users are distributed in M different classes. Furthermore, power level with which users in class j, j = 2, ..., M, transmit optical pulses, is twice the power level at which users of class j - 1 transmit their optical pulses. We achieve optical transmitter structure that satisfies these conditions using power control schemes. Also, we suggest two receiver structures for the aforementioned multiclass multilevel system. The first and simple receiver structure is based on optical AND logic gate elements. The second structure uses an optical ADC as well as optical AND logic gates. We obtain the performance for the aforementioned two types of receivers and compare their results with the traditional one-level OCDMA system. We show that using the proposed multilevel multiclass scheme improves system performance considerably by means of decreasing error probability as well as increasing the network capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications and Performance of Optical Analog-to-Digital Converter and Optical Logic Gate Elements in Multilevel Multiclass Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2037161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5594752/05361439.pdf","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2037161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Applications and Performance of Optical Analog-to-Digital Converter and Optical Logic Gate Elements in Multilevel Multiclass Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5361439/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11560875","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications and Performance of Optical Analog-to-Digital Converter and Optical Logic Gate Elements in Multilevel Multiclass Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"jstqe-salehi-2037161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069641S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5594752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5594752","articleId":"5361439","onlineDate":"28 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361461,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Wei Zhang (M'08) was born in Shijiazhuang, China, on August 31, 1975.

New techniques for analyzing CODs are introduced with connections to binary vector spaces.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361467.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Final Case of the Decoding Delay Problem for Maximum Rate Complex Orthogonal Designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361467/","displayDocTitle":"The Final Case of the Decoding Delay Problem for Maximum Rate Complex Orthogonal Designs","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024761","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361467/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Final Case of the Decoding Delay Problem for Maximum Rate Complex Orthogonal Designs","sourcePdf":"56tit01-sadams-2034818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090667S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361469,"authors":[{"name":"Sudharshan Srinivasan","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications Research (ITR), University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Sudharshan","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"38605276900"},{"name":"Steven S.

After deriving the dual APP (DAPP) algorithm from the APP relation, its trellis-based implementation is addressed. The challenge involved in practical implementation of a DAPP decoder is then highlighted. Metric representation schemes similar to the log domain used for log-APP decoding are shown to be unattractive for DAPP decoding due to quantization requirements. After explaining the nature of the DAPP metrics, an arc hyperbolic tangent (AHT) scheme is proposed and its equivalent arithmetic operations derived. By using an efficient approximation, an addition is translated to an addition in the AHT domain. Efficient techniques for normalization and extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR ) calculation are presented which reduce implementation complexity significantly. Simulation results with different high-rate codes are given to show that the AHT-DAPP decoder performs similarly to a log-APP decoder and at the same time performs better than a decoder for a punctured code. A fully fixed-point model of an AHT-DAPP decoder is shown to perform close to an optimum decoder. The decoding complexity of the log-APP and AHT-DAPP decoders are listed and compared for several rate-k/(k+1) codes. It is shown that an AHT-DAPP decoder starts to be less complex from a code rate of 7/8 . When compared against a max-log-APP decoder, the AHT-DAPP decoder is less complex at a code rate of 9/10 and above.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361469.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding of High Rate Convolutional Codes Using the Dual Trellis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decoding of High Rate Convolutional Codes Using the Dual Trellis","volume":"56","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024760","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361469/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding of High Rate Convolutional Codes Using the Dual Trellis","sourcePdf":"56tit01-ssrinivasan-2034882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051613S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5361469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5361472,"authors":[{"name":"Irina E.

However, its implementation in a wireless network involves the fundamental challenge of ensuring phase coherence of the radio frequency signals from the different transmitters in the presence of unknown phase offsets between the transmitters and unknown channel gains from the transmitters to the receiver. In this paper, it is shown that such phase alignment can be achieved using distributed adaptation by the transmitters with minimal feedback from the receiver. Specifically, each transmitter independently makes a small random adjustment to its phase at each iteration, while the receiver broadcasts a single bit of feedback, indicating whether the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved or worsened after the current iteration. The transmitters keep the \u00bfgood\u00bf phase adjustments and discard the \u00bfbad\u00bf ones, thus implementing a distributed ascent algorithm. It is shown that, for a broad class of distributions for the random phase adjustments, this procedure leads to asymptotic phase coherence with probability one. A simple analytical model, borrowing ideas from statistical mechanics, is used to characterize the progress of the algorithm, and to provide guidance on parameter choices. This analytical model is based on a conjecture on the distribution of the received phases when the number of transmitters becomes large. Finally, the proposed system is shown to be scalable: the random phase perturbations can be chosen such that the convergence time is linear in the number of collaborating nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361473.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Transmit Beamforming Using Feedback Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Feedback control","Radio transmitters","Analytical models","Information theory","Wireless networks","Radio frequency","RF signals","Receivers","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","feedback","probability","radio receivers","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed transmit beamforming","feedback control","network information theory","wireless network","radio frequency signal","transmitter","channel gain","receiver","phase alignment","signal-to-noise ratio","distributed ascent algorithm","asymptotic phase coherence","probability","statistical mechanics","random phase perturbation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed beamforming","sensor networks","space\u2013time communication","synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Transmit Beamforming Using Feedback Control","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5361473/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024766","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Transmit Beamforming Using Feedback Control","sourcePdf":"56tit01-rmudumbai-2034786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361476,"authors":[{"name":"Peiyu Tan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Peiyu Tan (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","She is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA.

We consider a number of different recovery criteria, including the exact recovery of the support of the signal, which was previously considered in the literature, as well as new criteria for the recovery of a large fraction of the support of the signal, and the recovery of a large fraction of the energy of the signal. For these recovery criteria, we prove that O(L) (an asymptotically linear multiple of L) measurements are necessary and sufficient for signal recovery, whenever L grows linearly as a function of M. This improves on the existing literature that is mostly focused on variants of a specific recovery algorithm based on convex programming, for which O(L log(M - L)) measurements are required. In contrast, the implementation of our proof method would have a higher complexity. We also show that O(L log(M - L)) measurements are required in the sublinear regime (L - o(M)). For our sufficiency proofs, we introduce a Shannon-theoretic decoder based on joint typicality, which allows error events to be defined in terms of a single random variable in contrast to previous information-theoretic work, where comparison of random variables are required. We also prove concentration results for our error bounds implying that a randomly selected Gaussian matrix will suffice with high probability. For our necessity proofs, we rely on results from channel coding and rate-distortion theory.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361481.pdf","startPage":"492","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shannon-Theoretic Limits on Noisy Compressive Sampling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Pollution measurement","Additive noise","Noise measurement","Decoding","Random variables","Sparse matrices","Data acquisition","Linear matrix inequalities","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","convex programming","Gaussian processes","rate distortion theory","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Shannon-theoretic limits","noisy compressive sampling","sparse signal","signal recovery","convex programming","Gaussian matrix","channel coding","rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","compressive sampling","estimation error","Fano's inequality","joint typicality","linear regime","Shannon theory","sublinear regime","support recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Shannon-Theoretic Limits on Noisy Compressive Sampling","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5361481/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024772","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shannon-Theoretic Limits on Noisy Compressive Sampling","sourcePdf":"56tit01-makcakaya-2034796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081951S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361482,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Chiani","affiliation":["WiLab/DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Marco Chiani (M'94\u2013SM'02) was born in Rimini, Italy, in April 1964.

However, the decrease in capacity due to the presence of interferers in MIMO networks is not well understood. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to characterize the capacity of MIMO communication systems in the presence of multiple MIMO co-channel interferers and noise. We consider the situation in which transmitters have no channel state information, and all links undergo Rayleigh fading. We first generalize the determinant representation of hypergeometric functions with matrix arguments to the case when the argument matrices have eigenvalues of arbitrary multiplicity. This enables the derivation of the distribution of the eigenvalues of Gaussian quadratic forms and Wishart matrices with arbitrary correlation, with application to both single-user and multiuser MIMO systems. In particular, we derive the ergodic mutual information for MIMO systems in the presence of multiple MIMO interferers. Our analysis is valid for any number of interferers, each with arbitrary number of antennas having possibly unequal power levels. This framework, therefore, accommodates the study of distributed MIMO systems and accounts for different spatial positions of the MIMO interferers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Networks: The Effects of Interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361482.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Networks: The Effects of Interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5361482/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024774","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Networks: The Effects of Interference","sourcePdf":"56tit01-mchiani-2034810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096874S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361483,"authors":[{"name":"Mao-Ching Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Mao-Ching Chiu (S'92\u2013A'96\u2013M'08) was born in Chiayi, Taiwan, on April 12, 1968.

However, due to the random nature of LDPC codes, most of the good LDPC codes found in the literature do not have a simple encoding structure. Thus, the encoding complexity of those LDPC codes can be as high as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n is the codeword length. To reduce the encoding complexity, in this paper, nonbinary irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA) codes with time-varying characteristic and random-coset mapping are proposed for bandwidth-efficient modulation schemes. The time-varying characteristic and random-coset mapping result in both permutation-invariance and symmetry properties, respectively, in the densities of decoder messages. The permutation-invariance and symmetry properties of the proposed codes enable the approximations of densities of decoder messages using Gaussian distributions. Under the Gaussian approximation, extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts for nonbinary IRA codes are developed and several codes of different spectral efficiencies are designed based on EXIT charts. In addition, by proper selection of nonuniform signal constellations, the constructed codes are inherently capable of obtaining shaping gains, even without separate shaping codes. Simulation results indicate that the proposed codes not only have simple encoding schemes, but also have remarkable performance that is even better than that constructed using nonbinary LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361483.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth-Efficient Modulation Codes Based on Nonbinary Irregular Repeat\u2013Accumulate Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361483/","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth-Efficient Modulation Codes Based on Nonbinary Irregular Repeat\u2013Accumulate Codes","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024776","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361483/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth-Efficient Modulation Codes Based on Nonbinary Irregular Repeat\u2013Accumulate Codes","sourcePdf":"56tit01-mchiu-2034798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11452S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5361485,"authors":[{"name":"Joel A.

In many applications, however, sampling at the Nyquist rate is inefficient because the signals of interest contain only a small number of significant frequencies relative to the band limit, although the locations of the frequencies may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse signal, other sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type of data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is constructed from robust, readily available components. Let K denote the total number of frequencies in the signal, and let W denote its band limit in hertz. Simulations suggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per second to stably reconstruct the signal. This sampling rate is exponentially lower than the Nyquist rate of W hertz. In contrast to Nyquist sampling, one must use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the signal from the samples taken by the random demodulator. This paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the system's performance that supports the empirical observations.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361485.pdf","startPage":"520","endPage":"544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond Nyquist: Efficient Sampling of Sparse Bandlimited Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Beyond Nyquist: Efficient Sampling of Sparse Bandlimited Signals","volume":"56","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361485/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024779","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361485/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Nyquist: Efficient Sampling of Sparse Bandlimited Signals","sourcePdf":"56tit01-jtropp-2034811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197639S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"685","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5361488,"authors":[{"name":"Lara Dolecek","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Lara Dolecek (S'07\u2013M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences, as well as the M.A. degree in statistics, all from the University of California, Berkeley.","She was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, from 2007 to 2009.

Several approaches have been developed to recover the unknown sparse vectors from the given observations, including thresholding, simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP), and convex relaxation based on a mixed matrix norm. Typically, worst case analysis is carried out in order to analyze conditions under which the algorithms are able to recover any jointly sparse set of vectors. However, such an approach is not able to provide insights into why joint sparse recovery is superior to applying standard sparse reconstruction methods to each channel individually. Previous work considered an average case analysis of thresholding and SOMP by imposing a probability model on the measured signals. Here, the main focus is on analysis of convex relaxation techniques. In particular, the mixed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">l</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,1</sub>\n approach to multichannel recovery is investigated. Under a very mild condition on the sparsity and on the dictionary characteristics, measured for example by the coherence, it is shown that the probability of recovery failure decays exponentially in the number of channels. This demonstrates that most of the time, multichannel sparse recovery is indeed superior to single channel methods. The probability bounds are valid and meaningful even for a small number of signals. Using the tools developed to analyze the convex relaxation technique, also previous bounds for thresholding and SOMP recovery are tightened.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034789","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"505","endPage":"519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361489.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average Case Analysis of Multichannel Sparse Recovery Using Convex Relaxation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Sparse matrices","Algorithm design and analysis","Radar signal processing","Mathematics","Vectors","Reconstruction algorithms","Signal analysis","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","relaxation theory","signal reconstruction","sparse matrices","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average case analysis","multichannel sparse recovery","jointly sparse multichannel signals","incomplete measurements","sparse vectors","simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit","mixed matrix norm","joint sparse recovery","standard sparse reconstruction methods","probability model","convex relaxation techniques","multichannel recovery","recovery failure decays","single channel methods","probability bounds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average performance","mixed-norm optimization","multichannel sparse recovery","simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit","thresholding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Average Case Analysis of Multichannel Sparse Recovery Using Convex Relaxation","volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024782","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5361489/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361489/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average Case Analysis of Multichannel Sparse Recovery Using Convex Relaxation","sourcePdf":"56tit01-hrauhut-2034789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130835S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5361490,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Lu","affiliation":["Sun Microsystems, Bloomfield, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jin Lu (S'01\u2013M'06) received the bachelor and master degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2004.","Then he joined Sun Microsystems, Broomfield, CO, as a researcher.

Extending the idea of having silent nodes in a WSN overhear the two-way timing message communication between two active (master and slave) nodes, this paper derives the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for the clock offsets of the listening nodes located within the communication range of the active nodes by assuming an exponential link delay modeling, hence synchronizing with the reference node at a very low cost. A vital advantage for adopting such an approach is that the performance of sender-receiver protocols can be compared with receiver-receiver protocols on equal footings, because their main critical aspect was associated with the high-communication overhead induced by the point-to-point nature of communication links relative to broadcast communications. The MLE is also shown to be the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) of the clock offset when the mean of exponential link delays is known. Since it is attractive to know in advance the extent to which an estimator can perform through its lower bound, the Chapman-Robbins bound and the Barankin bound for the clock offset estimator are also derived. It is shown that for an exponential link delay model, the mean square error of the clock offset estimator is inversely proportional to the square of the number of observations, and hence its performance is on a similar scale, albeit slightly lesser, as compared to the usual sender-receiver clock offset estimator. In addition, a novel method referred to as the Gaussian mixture Kalman particle filter (GMKPF) is proposed herein to estimate the clock offsets of the listening nodes in a WSN. GMKPF represents a better and flexible alternative to the MLE for the clock offset estimation problem due to its improved performance and applicability in arbitrary and generalized non-Gaussian random delay models.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"582","endPage":"596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361493.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Clocks","Wireless sensor networks","Delay estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Protocols","Timing","Master-slave","Synchronization","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","particle filtering (numerical methods)","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient estimation","clock offset estimator","wireless sensor network","maximum-likelihood estimator","sender-receiver protocol","receiver-receiver protocol","minimum variance unbiased estimator","Chapman-Robbins bound","Barankin bound","mean square error","Gaussian mixture Kalman particle filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clock","estimation","sensor","synchronization","timing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Estimation of Clock Offset for Inactive Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361493/","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5361493/","accessionNumber":"11024784","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Estimation of Clock Offset for Inactive Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"56tit01-eserpedin-2034817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09823S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5361494,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9rique Oggier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA","School of Mathematical Sciences, Division of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier received the Dipl\u00f4me degree in mathematics and computer science in 2000 from the University of Geneva, Switzerland.

The underspread assumption is satisfied by virtually all wireless communication channels. For input signals that are peak constrained in time and frequency, we obtain upper and lower bounds on capacity that are explicit in the channel's scattering function, are accurate for a large range of bandwidth, and allow to coarsely identify the capacity-optimal bandwidth as a function of the peak power and the channel's scattering function. We also obtain a closed-form expression for the first-order Taylor series expansion of capacity in the infinite-bandwidth limit, and show that our bounds are tight in the wideband regime. For input signals that are peak constrained in time only (and, hence, allowed to be peaky in frequency), we provide upper and lower bounds on the infinite-bandwidth capacity. Our lower bound is closely related to a result by Viterbi (1967). We find cases where the bounds coincide and, hence, the infinite-bandwidth capacity is characterized exactly. The analysis in this paper is based on a discrete-time discrete-frequency approximation of WSSUS time- and frequency-selective channels. This discretization takes the underspread property of the channel explicitly into account.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2034807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2034807","startPage":"367","endPage":"395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5361455/05361496.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent Capacity of Underspread Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent Capacity of Underspread Fading Channels","volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024790","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5361496/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent Capacity of Underspread Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tit01-gdurisi-2034807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.234991S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5361498,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc-Dung Dao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Ngoc-D\u0169ng \u0110\u00e0o (S'02\u2013M'07) received the B.Eng. degree in communications engineering from Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1995, the M.Eng. degree in telecommunications from Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Pathumthani, Thailand, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2006.","He was with Siemens Information and Communications Networks Vietnam and held various technical positions from 1995 to 2001.

SAST codes are delay optimal when the number of transmit antennas is even. The SAST codeword matrix has a generalized Alamouti structure where the transmitted symbols are replaced by circulant matrices and the commutativity of circulant matrices simplifies the detection of transmit symbols. SAST codes with maximal coding gain are constructed by using rate-one linear threaded algebraic space\u2013time (LTAST) codes. Compared with LTSAT codes, SAST codes not only reduce the complexity of maximum-likelihood detection, but also provide remarkable performance gain. They also outperform other STBC with rate one or less. SAST codes also perform well with suboptimal detectors such as the vertical-Bell Laboratories layered space\u2013time (V-BLAST) nulling and cancellation receiver. Finally, SAST codes attain nearly 100% of the Shannon capacity of open-loop multiple-input\u2013single-output (MISO) channels. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5361498/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11024789","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Semiorthogonal Space\u2013Time Block Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiorthogonal Space\u2013Time Block Codes","sourcePdf":"56tit01-ddao-2034880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066185S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5361455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5361455","articleId":"5361498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5361503,"authors":[{"name":"Robert G.

Although the behavior of microbubbles of certain sizes might be masked by the behavior of others, the acoustic characterization of UCA is typically made on full populations. In this paper, we have combined acoustic and optical methods to investigate the response of isolated lipid-shelled microbubbles to low-pressure (49 and 62 kPa peak negative pressure) ultrasound tone bursts. These bursts induced slow deflation of the microbubbles. The experimental setup included a microscope connected to a fast camera acquiring one frame per pulse transmitted by a single-element transducer. The behavior of each bubble was measured at multiple frequencies, by cyclically changing the transmission frequency over the range of 2 to 4 MHz during subsequent pulse repetition intervals. The bubble echoes were captured by a second transducer and coherently recorded. More than 50 individual microbubbles were observed. Microbubbles with radii larger than 3 ?m did not experience any size reduction. Smaller bubbles slowly deflated, generally until the radius reached a value around 1.4 ?m, independent of the initial microbubble size. The detected pressure amplitude backscattered at 2.5 cm distance was very low, decreasing from about 5 Pa down to 1 Pa at 2 MHz as the bubbles deflated. The resonant radius was evaluated from the echo amplitude normalized with respect to the geometrical cross section. At 2-MHz excitation, deflating microbubbles showed highest normalized echo when the radius was 2.2 ?m while at higher excitation frequencies, the resonant radius was lower. The relative phase shift of the echo during the deflation process was also measured. It was found to exceed ?/2 in all cases. A heuristic procedure based on the analysis of multiple bubbles of a same population was used to estimate the undamped natural frequency. It was found that a microbubble of 1.7 ?m has an undamped natural frequency of 2 MHz. The difference between this size and the resonant radius is discussed as indicative of significant damping.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024873","htmlLink":"/document/5361542/","pubMedId":"20040446","displayDocTitle":"Microbubble characterization through acoustically induced deflation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microbubble characterization through acoustically induced deflation","sourcePdf":"t1010193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138592S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5361508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5361508","articleId":"5361542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5361579,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin J.

To be considered as viable insulating fluids for high voltage equipment, alternative dielectric liquids should have similar lightning impulse characteristics as compared to mineral oil to provide the clearances necessary for common dielectric design. This paper reviews the testing for establishing the lightning impulse breakdown characteristics of natural ester fluids relative to mineral oil test results. The key variables of the testing included: various oil gap and solid insulation creep distances, electrode configurations, electrical stress characteristics, and solid insulation surfaces. The fluid gaps ranged from 3 mm to 55 mm. The electrode configurations included quasi-uniform in oil gaps, with some attached to pressboard, and nonhomogeneous contacts in oil gaps combined with a phenolic interface. The range in gap distance was selected to reflect the range commonly used in liquid insulated transformer core/coil designs. The electrical stresses used included 1.2 \u00d7 50 \u03bcs lightning impulses of both positive and negative polarity. The solid insulation materials consisted of high density pressboard, Kraft paper and a high density phenolic composite. It is concluded that the impulse breakdown voltage of the natural ester fluid is similar to mineral oil for the oil gaps and electrode configurations tested.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5361564/05361579.pdf","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2009.5361579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2009.5361579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightning Impulse Testing of Natural Ester Fluid Gaps and Insulation Interfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lightning","Impulse testing","Petroleum","Power transformer insulation","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Oil insulation","Minerals","Dielectric liquids","Solids","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric breakdown","impulse testing","insulation testing","paper","power transformer insulation","transformer cores","transformer oil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightning impulse testing","natural ester fluid gaps","insulation interfaces","mineral oil","lightning impulse breakdown voltage","withstand testing","transformer insulation system design","viable insulating fluids","high voltage equipment","dielectric liquids","solid insulation creep distances","electrode configurations","electrical stress characteristics","solid insulation surfaces","phenolic interface","liquid insulated transformer core","coil designs","solid insulation materials","high density pressboard","Kraft paper","high density phenolic composite","dielectric design","negative polarity","positive polarity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Creep breakdown, lightning impulse, natural ester, oil breakdown, phenolic composite, pressboard"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Lightning Impulse Testing of Natural Ester Fluid Gaps and Insulation Interfaces","volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5361579/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"11024962","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightning Impulse Testing of Natural Ester Fluid Gaps and Insulation Interfaces","sourcePdf":"p1595-rapp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076669S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5361564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5361564","articleId":"5361579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5361581,"authors":[{"name":"Alfredo Contin","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic and Computer Science Department, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/5361564/5361581/5361581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alfredo Contin (M'87) was born in Udine on 30 January 1955.

It is based on the comparison of the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) of the recorded signals assuming that the same source can generate signals having similar ACF while ACF differ when signals with different shapes are compared. The ACF has been selected for its capability of well summarize both time- and frequency-dependent features of the signals. A correlation index that presents the best compromise between strong and weak discrimination among pulses, has been selected out of different distance measurements. The final result of the algorithm is a set of classes containing signals having similar shape which can be processed successively for signal source identification. Meaningful applications of the proposed algorithm are also reported. Improvements in separation effectiveness can enhance the clearness of the PD patterns and, consequently, the quality of the defect identification.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2009.5361581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2009.5361581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361564","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1622","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5361564/05361581.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361581","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Autocorrelation","Shape","Signal processing","Classification algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Multi-stage noise shaping","Signal generators","Frequency","Pulse measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge measurement","pattern clustering","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge signal separation","partial discharge signal classification","k-means clustering classification algorithm","pulsating noise","auto-correlation function","correlation index","signal source identification","defect identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial Discharges, signal classification, diagnostics, solid insulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification and separation of partial discharge signals by means of their auto-correlation function evaluation","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"11036081","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5361581/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361581/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification and separation of partial discharge signals by means of their auto-correlation function evaluation","sourcePdf":"p1609-contin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136529S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5361564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5361564","articleId":"5361581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5361590,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshihito Ebisawa","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/5361564/5361590/5361590-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yoshihito Ebisawa (M'09) was born in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan in 1954.

Our system gives a promising result with an F-measure of 97%, higher than the results of existing publicly available Vietnamese word segmentation systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Approach to Vietnamese Word Segmentation Using Part of Speech Tags","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering","doi":"10.1109/KSE.2009.44","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361685/5361686/05361713.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KSE.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Approach to Vietnamese Word Segmentation Using Part of Speech Tags","conferenceDate":"13-17 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361713/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11048310","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Approach to Vietnamese Word Segmentation Using Part of Speech Tags","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"3846a154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054095S","chronDate":"13-17 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361685","isNumber":"5361686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361685","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5361686","articleId":"5361713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5361723,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Hong Long","affiliation":["Department of System Engineering, Institute for Information Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Pham Hong","lastName":"Long","id":"38179902000"},{"name":"Pham Thuong Cat","affiliation":["Department of Automation Technology, Institute for Information Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Pham Thuong","lastName":"Cat","id":"37396639300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5086-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3846-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5361723","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Cellular neural networks","Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Mathematical model","Knowledge engineering","Systems engineering and theory","Information technology","Nonlinear equations","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","edge detection","image segmentation","mathematics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time image processing","cellular neural network","FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion equation","edge detection","image segmentation","Matlab simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reaction-Diffusion PDE","Cellular Neural Network","Image Processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361723","abstract":"In this paper we propose two architectures of cellular neural network (CNN) for edge detection and segmentation of noisy image based on FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion equation.

First, it is shown that the problem of minimizing energy consumption of real-time tasks is NP-hard even on the lightly loaded multi-core platform. Next a heuristic scheduling scheme is proposed to find an energy-efficient schedule with a low time complexity while meeting the deadlines of real-time tasks. The scheme exploits overabundant cores to reduce energy consumption using parallel execution and turns off the power of unused or rarely used cores. Evaluation shows that the proposed scheme saves up to 64% energy consumption of the existing method executing each task on a separate core.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361740","publicationTitle":"2009 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361739/5361740/05361764.pdf","doi":"10.1109/DS-RT.2009.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DS-RT.2009.12","startPage":"216","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Saving DVFS Scheduling of Multiple Periodic Real-Time Tasks on Multi-core Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361764/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Saving DVFS Scheduling of Multiple Periodic Real-Time Tasks on Multi-core Processors","htmlLink":"/document/5361764/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11048347","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Saving DVFS Scheduling of Multiple Periodic Real-Time Tasks on Multi-core Processors","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3868a216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079318S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361739","isNumber":"5361740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361739","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5361740","articleId":"5361764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5361805,"authors":[{"name":"Yolanda Becerra","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Yolanda","lastName":"Becerra","id":"37611361600"},{"name":"Vicen\u00e7 Beltran","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicen\u00e7","lastName":"Beltran","id":"37281793400"},{"name":"David Carrera","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Carrera","id":"37281792900"},{"name":"Marc Gonzalez","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"37271171700"},{"name":"Jordi Torres","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Torres","id":"37270777700"},{"name":"Eduard Ayguade","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Ayguade","id":"37283770000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4961-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3802-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"5361805","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":304},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speeding Up Distributed MapReduce Applications Using Hardware Accelerators","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361797/5361798/05361805.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Parallel Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2009.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361798","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2009.59","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Acceleration","Parallel processing","Runtime","Costs","Computer networks","Computer architecture","Operating systems","Parallel programming","Computer applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcomputers","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MapReduce applications","hardware accelerators","intrinsic multilevel parallelism","parallel programming model","distributed programming model","data driven programming model","Cell BE cluster","multicores processor","heterogeneous processors","graphics processing unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","Hardware Accelerators","cell BE","multi-core processors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361805","abstract":"In an attempt to increase the performance/cost ratio, large compute clusters are becoming heterogeneous at multiple levels: from asymmetric processors, to different system architectures, operating systems and networks. Exploiting the intrinsic multi-level parallelism present in such a complex execution environment has become a challenging task using traditional parallel and distributed programming models. As a result, an increasing need for novel approaches to exploiting parallelism has arisen in these environments. MapReduce is a data-driven programming model originally proposed by Google back in 2004 as a flexible alternative to the existing models, specially devoted to hiding the complexity of both developing and running massively distributed applications in large compute clusters. In some recent works, the MapReduce model has been also used to exploit parallelism in other non-distributed environments, such as multi-cores, heterogeneous processors and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for exploiting the heterogeneity of a Cell BE cluster linking an existing MapReduce runtime implementation for distributed clusters and one runtime to exploit the parallelism of the Cell BE nodes. The novel contribution of this work is the design and evaluation of a MapReduce execution environment that effectively exploits the parallelism existing at both the Cell BE cluster level and the heterogeneous processors level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035051","htmlLink":"/document/5361805/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speeding Up Distributed MapReduce Applications Using Hardware Accelerators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speeding Up Distributed MapReduce Applications Using Hardware Accelerators","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3802a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049154S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361797","isNumber":"5361798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361797","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5361798","articleId":"5361805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5361892,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Zhang","affiliation":["Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37674099100"},{"name":"Qinghe Hu","affiliation":["College of Information & Science Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Qinghe","lastName":"Hu","id":"37667405600"},{"name":"Xingwei Wang","affiliation":["College of Information & Science Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293609500"},{"name":"Zhiliang Zhu","affiliation":["College of Information & Science Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37407458200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3853-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5361892","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361892","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Power transformers","Power transformer insulation","Cost function","Ant colony optimization","Production","Application software","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","genetic algorithms","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos genetic algorithm","transformer optimal design","power transformer","transformer electromagnetic calculation optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optimal design","genetic algorithm","chaos","calculation optimization","transformer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWCFTA.2009.30","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361800/5361801/05361892.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Chaos-Fractals Theories and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Chaos-Fractals Theories and Applications","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCFTA.2009.30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Chaos Genetic Algorithm to Transformer Optimal Design","abstract":"Optimal design of power transformer is discrete, multi-variable, nonlinear, multi-purposed, and mixed programmed.

Then we can make full use of their advantages and achieve a good design of sensor network node.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Chaos-Fractals Theories and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361800/5361801/05361982.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"2009 International Workshop on Chaos-Fractals Theories and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IWCFTA.2009.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCFTA.2009.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5361982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Wireless Sensor Network Node with Hyperchaos Encryption Based on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Cryptography","Field programmable gate arrays","Radio frequency","Transceivers","Data processing","ZigBee","Communication system control","Registers","Wireless application protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","personal area networks","protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network node","hyperchaos encryption","FPGA","ZigBee protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperchaos","encryption","Wireless sensor network","FPGA","ZigBee","CC2430"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5361982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Wireless Sensor Network Node with Hyperchaos Encryption Based on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5361982/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11024437","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Wireless Sensor Network Node with Hyperchaos Encryption Based on FPGA","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"3853a190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063634S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361800","isNumber":"5361801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361800","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5361801","articleId":"5361982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5361986,"authors":[{"name":"Qigong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Wuhu, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Qigong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37534691800"},{"name":"Lisheng Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Wuhu, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Lisheng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37532628900"},{"name":"Ming Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Wuhu, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37531086300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3888-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5361986","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","MIMO","Networked control systems","Communication system control","Control systems","Communications technology","Delay effects","Asymptotic stability","Lyapunov method","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","control system analysis","delay systems","distributed control","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear MIMO system","nonlinear networked control system","multiple packet transmission policy","network-induced delay","packet dropout","asymptotical stability","maximum allowable delay conditions","time-delay system","Lyapunov method","Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory","LMI","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked Control Systems (NCSs)","Stability","Nonlinear","Maximum Allowable Delay Bound","Linear Matric Inequality (LMI)"]}],"abstract":"The issue of stability analysis for nonlinear MIMO networked control systems (NCSs) is researched, where its network transmission is connected with network-induced delay and packet dropout. The effect of network-induced delay to the stability of nonlinear networked control system s is considered. Asymptotical stability under a multiple-packet transmission policy is analyzed and the maximum allowable delay conditions for systems are derived by using time-delay system theory and the 2nd Lyapunov method. Then based on the research of Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, the LMI's conditions for asymptotic stability are derived.

However, with the learning pattern of focusing on hard sample, AdaBooting makes neural network fall into degradation easily. Additionally, in neural network ensemble the weight of individual neural network only takes into account the misclassifying rate. In fact, due to the characteristic of neural network's tendency of learning hard samples in Adaboosting algorithm, the predictive accuracy of individual neural network's training for a particular sample space is much higher than for the whole sample space. This paper proposes an improved AdaBoosting algorithm called Cloud-AdaBoosting. In this method, it is introduced the concept of cloud model and applied the technique of filling training set with similar samples generated by cloud generator to overcome the degradation phenomena resulted from the tendency of learning hard samples. Through calculating the certainty degree of each test sample relative to neural network, it is adjusted dynamically the weight of whole neural network output by individual neural network which can reflect the prediction ability of a part of samples in neural network ensemble, and then enhance the whole prediction performance of the ensemble. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient to increase the prediction accuracy of neural network ensemble.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Neural networks","Clouds","Accuracy","Computer networks","Degradation","Machine learning algorithms","Machine learning","Knowledge acquisition","Gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive boosting algorithm","AdaBoosting","neural network","multidimensional cloud model","Cloud-AdaBoosting","prediction accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["boosting","neural network ensemble","cloud model","cloud generator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/KAM.2009.59","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361789/5361790/05362179.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KAM.2009.59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Adaptive Boosting Algorithm for Neural Network Ensemble Based on Multi-dimensional Cloud Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5362179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Adaptive Boosting Algorithm for Neural Network Ensemble Based on Multi-dimensional Cloud Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362179/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5362179/","accessionNumber":"11048427","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-1 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 1 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Adaptive Boosting Algorithm for Neural Network Ensemble Based on Multi-dimensional Cloud Model","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3888b170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064959S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361789","isNumber":"5361790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361789","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5361790","articleId":"5362179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5362180,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Ding","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37397821800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3888-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5362180","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":945},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Filters","Space technology","Ant colony optimization","Bandwidth","Kernel","Data mining","Machine learning","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","radial basis function networks","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","ant colony optimization algorithm","support vector machine","SVM","radial basis function","F-score models","grid searching algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feature selection","F-score","ant colony optimization (ACO)","support vector machine(SVM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5362180","abstract":"This study proposes a new strategy combining with the SVM(support vector machine) classifier for features selection that retains sufficient information for classification purpose.

Often, such systems are expected to function in an environment where uncertainty in system parameters is common. In such an environment, the amount of processing required to complete an application may fluctuate substantially. Determining a resource allocation that accounts for this uncertainty-in a way that can provide a probability that a given level of service is achieved-is an important area of research. We define a mathematical model of stochastic robustness appropriate for a dynamic environment that can be used during resource allocation to aid heuristic decision making. In addition, we design a novel technique for maximizing stochastic robustness in this environment. Our performance results for this technique are compared with several well known resource allocation techniques in a simulated environment that models a heterogeneous distributed computing system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5362292/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11035069","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic-Based Robust Dynamic Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Computing System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic-Based Robust Dynamic Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Computing System","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3802a188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128797S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361797","isNumber":"5361798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361797","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5361798","articleId":"5362292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5362319,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Xia","affiliation":["State key Laboratory of Networking and Switch Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Institute of Computer System Architecture and Network, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Xia","id":"37406051600"},{"name":"Zengzhi Li","affiliation":["State key Laboratory of Networking and Switch Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Institute of Computer System Architecture and Network, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Zengzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37279078600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3888-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5362319","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Web services","Quality of service","Constraint optimization","Pareto optimization","Service oriented architecture","Switches","Constraint theory","Logic","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm algorithm","service-oriented Web services selection","QoS","multiobjective constrained optimization problem","Pareto optimal solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["web service","service composition","service selection","quality of service","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5362319","abstract":"Existing Web services composition technology, lack of services selecting.

Major results of our study include: 1. A good mapping of FDTD can effectively exploit the on-chip parallelism of C64-like architectures and show good performance and scalability. 2. Such performance improvement is derived by employing a number of code optimization techniques such as time skewing and split tiling that judiciously exploit the architecture features described in (1). 3. High performance requires maximum reuse of on-chip memory, which is obtained by tiling with non conventional tile shapes. 4. Such code optimization techniques we used in (2) and tiling such as the one used in (3) should be implementable within a reasonable compilation framework, opening a new set of possibilities for compiler optimizations.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2009.44","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5361797/5361798/05362372.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361798","startPage":"309","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping the FDTD Application to Many-Core Chip Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5362372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mapping the FDTD Application to Many-Core Chip Architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362372/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11035084","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5362372/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping the FDTD Application to Many-Core Chip Architectures","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3802a309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079208S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5361797","isNumber":"5361798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5361797","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5361798","articleId":"5362372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5362380,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Benoit","affiliation":["LIP Laboratory ENS Lyon, CNRS INRIA UCBL, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Benoit","id":"37408200000"},{"name":"Mourad Hakem","affiliation":["LIFC Laboratory, Universita de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Hakem","id":"37422452200"},{"name":"Yves Robert","affiliation":["LIP Laboratory ENS Lyon, CNRS INRIA UCBL, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Robert","id":"37283850600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4961-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3802-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"5362380","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Delay","Throughput","Parallel processing","Laboratories","Processor scheduling","Streaming media","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","fault tolerant computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling streaming application","throughput constraint","reliability constraint","realistic one-port model","latency optimization","processor failure tolerance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we deal with the problem of scheduling streaming applications on unreliable heterogeneous platforms.

The neural network techniques may memory large quantity of characteristics of data set by learning previous data, and is suitable for solving these problems with large complexity. IP6 network traffic prediction is just the problem with nonlinear feature and can be solved using appropriate neural network model. In this paper, according to the daily cycle characteristic of IPv6 network traffic, a novel transfer function is designed, which has lots of advantages such as fast convergence and high precision. Based on the new transfer function, an improved BP neural network model is produced, and a IPv6 network traffic prediction system is implemented. Using this new BP neural network model to process the actual data, the results present that our model has a faster learning ability and has a higher precision compared with previous BP neural network model.

Integrating heuristic rules and numerical calculation with genetic algorithm, the method for skeleton restoration scheme generating of every subsystem is proposed. In this method, fitness value is given by numerical calculation and global optimization is realized by genetic algorithm. The evaluation function of skeleton restoration scheme presented in this paper can comprehensively consider security margin, restoration duration and economic indicators of loads. During encoding, units and loads are mixed together, while they are divided into two parts in order during decoding. The former part gives the restoration sequence of units and the latter part describes that of loads. Calculation speed of this method is improved by incorporating heuristic rules into the generating process of restoration scheme.

Most traditional systems have focused on spectral features or prosodic features. Since both the spectral and the prosodic features contain emotion information, it is believed that the combining of spectral features and prosodic features will improve the performance of the emotion recognition system. Therefore, we propose to use both spectral and prosodic features. For spectral features, a GMM super vector based SVM is applied with them. For prosodic features, a set of prosodic features that are clearly correlated with speech emotional states and SVM is also used for emotion recognition. The combination of both spectral features and prosodic features is posed as a data fusion problem to obtain the final decision. Experimental results show that the combining of both spectral features and prosodic features yields the emotion error reduction rate of 18.0% and 52.8%, over using only spectral and prosodic features.","doi":"10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5362730","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362513/5362514/05362730.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5362730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Both Spectral and Prosodic Features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Emotion recognition","Support vector machines","Spatial databases","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Support vector machine classification","Cepstral analysis","Sun","Acoustics","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","Gaussian processes","speech recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech emotion recognition","spectral features","prosodic features","GMM super vector","Gaussian mixture model","SVM","support vector machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Both Spectral and Prosodic Features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5362730/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11033124","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Both Spectral and Prosodic Features","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"5-038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082271S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362513","isNumber":"5362514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362513","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5362514","articleId":"5362730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5362739,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhua Zhu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuhua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37406130200"},{"name":"Tong Zhen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhen","id":"37395892700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5362739","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Uncertainty","Educational institutions","Information science","Electronic mail","Power system modeling","Decision making","Temperature sensors","Humidity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agricultural products","fuzzy neural nets","inference mechanisms","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grain quality evaluation","FNN neural network","D-S evidence theory","fuzzy neural network","basic probability assignment function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5362739","abstract":"The output of the fuzzy neural network was adopted as BPAF (basic probability assignment function) in this paper.

Experimental results on four test problems show that the FOPF algorithm is able to find solutions with good diversity, which are near the true Pareto-optimal front, and improves significantly time performance compared to the known NSGA2.","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362493/05362766.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.199","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Evolutionary Algorithm for Solving Multiobjective Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Evolutionary Algorithm for Solving Multiobjective Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362766/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5362766/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034298","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Evolutionary Algorithm for Solving Multiobjective Optimization","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736d563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059714S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5362493","articleId":"5362766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5362791,"authors":[{"name":"Runbo Bai","affiliation":["College of Water-Conservancy and Civil Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China"],"firstName":"Runbo","lastName":"Bai","id":"37682065600"},{"name":"Fusheng Liu","affiliation":["College of Water-Conservancy and Civil Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China"],"firstName":"Fusheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37672648100"},{"name":"Xiumei Qiu","affiliation":["College of Water-Conservancy and Civil Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China"],"firstName":"Xiumei","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37671963900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4994-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-7379"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-7387"}],"articleNumber":"5362791","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5362791","abstract":"The 'perturbation' method is an effective and widely used method in the factor sensitivity analysis in neural network design, on which two major problems: the sensitivity definition and the input perturbation ratio, are investigated in this study.

Developing the GAs to increase their speed in finding the global minimum or maximum of a cost function has been a big challenge until now and many variants of GA has been evolved to accomplish this goal. This paper presents two new sequential mutation method and circular gene method to increase the speed of the GA. These methods attain a better final answer accompanied by lesser use of cost function evaluations in comparison with the original GA and some other known complementary methods. In addition, it speeds up reaching the minimum or maximum point regarding the number of generations. A number of common test functions with known minimum values and points are tested and the results are compared with some other algorithms such as original GA, bacterial evolutionary algorithm, jumping gene and PSO. Simulation results show that the presented methods in this paper can reach the global minimum point through lesser generations and evaluations of the cost function in comparison with the traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2009.140","startPage":"31","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362793/5362794/05362810.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2009.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speeding Up the Genetic Algorithm Convergence Using Sequential Mutation and Circular Gene Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Convergence","Genetic mutations","Cost function","Evolutionary computation","Biological cells","Cloning","DNA","Computational intelligence","Genetic engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm convergence","sequential mutation","circular gene methods","intelligent computational tools","bacterial evolutionary algorithm","jumping gene algorithms","PSO","cost function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","speeding up the convergence","sequential mutation method","circular gene method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Speeding Up the Genetic Algorithm Convergence Using Sequential Mutation and Circular Gene Methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5362810/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036441","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speeding Up the Genetic Algorithm Convergence Using Sequential Mutation and Circular Gene Methods","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3872a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080132S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362793","isNumber":"5362794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362793","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5362794","articleId":"5362810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5362817,"authors":[{"name":"Baichuan Lu","affiliation":["Transp.

For solving it, many authors have used Genetic Algorithms (GAs) with the objective of reaching an efficient plant layout design. To represent the plant layout design as a data structure, GAs require a defined encoding scheme. Such a structure defines the types of solutions that can be obtained, and influences the GA's ability to find good solutions. There are a few surveys on facility layout problems, but they have not addressed evolutionary issues in depth. This work presents a review that focuses on encoding schemes and related operators used in GAs, and suggests a method of classifying the different encoding structures described in the bibliography. We also studied their main characteristics and objectives; and successfully identified the crossover and mutation operators that could be utilized depending on the type of encoding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2009.206","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2009.206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362794","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362793/5362794/05362866.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoding Structures and Operators Used in Facility Layout Problems with Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362866/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Encoding Structures and Operators Used in Facility Layout Problems with Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5362866/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11036442","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoding Structures and Operators Used in Facility Layout Problems with Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3872a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081631S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362793","isNumber":"5362794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362793","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5362794","articleId":"5362866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5362891,"authors":[{"name":"Fangguo He","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Information Science, Huanggang Normal University, Huanggang, China"],"firstName":"Fangguo","lastName":"He","id":"37529391500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5362891","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Birds","Educational institutions","Helium","Mathematics","Information science","Concrete","Resource management","Investments","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knapsack problems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knapsack problem","improved particle swarm optimization","discrete optimization problem","penalty function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5362891","abstract":"The knapsack problem is formulated as a discrete optimization problem.

Underwater Objects Based on Probabilistic Neural Network","abstract":"Classification of underwater objects remains challenging and significant problem because of the complexity of underwater environments. In this paper,a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is used as a classifier to the automatic classification of underwater objects. Firstly, a process of multi-field feature extraction is employed to construct a feature vector.The multi-field feature extraction involves time-domain analysis, time-frequency distribution, spectra and bispectra analysis. Underwater target classification can be considered as a problem of small sample recognition, because samples acquired under different conditions often exhibit different clustering characteristics. Probabilistic neural network is chosen to discriminate underwater objects because of its simplicity, robustness to noise, and nonlinear decision boundaries. The PNN classifier is contrasted with a Gaussian classifier and a support vector machine (SVM) using lake or sea trial data. Experimental results indicated the PNN classifier is appropriate to this problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5362942/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11034589","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5362942/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Underwater Objects Based on Probabilistic Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Underwater Objects Based on Probabilistic Neural Network","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736b038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049341S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5362506","articleId":"5362942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5362991,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37678350000"},{"name":"Guangyin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Guangyin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37668636200"},{"name":"Jian Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Lian","id":"37682843400"},{"name":"Junqiang Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Junqiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37673702600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5362991","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Microcell networks","Frequency domain analysis","Multimedia systems","3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","Macrocell networks","Equations","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","code division multiple access","fast Fourier transforms","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft handover","fast Fourier transforms","FFT","code division multiple access system","CDMA system","multimedia services","3G CDMA mobile communication system","4G CDMA mobile communication system","cellular architecture","mobile station","base station"]}],"abstract":"Aiming at the multimedia services in the 3G and 4G CDMA mobile communication system, a soft handover model, in which an overlaid cellular architecture including one macrocell and seven microcells with video service, is given, and link equation of CDMA discrete system in frequency domain is established.

The macroscopic model to describe the evolution of freeway traffic flow is firstly established. Then traffic density is selected as the control variable in place of traffic occupancy, and the control objective is determined. In conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, the iterative learning based ramp control system is designed. Finally, the system simulation is carried out using Matlab software. It is shown that the iterative learning method can effectively deal with this class of control problem and greatly improve the traffic response. This method can achieve an almost perfect tracking performance and eliminate the traffic jams.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5363028/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046620","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Freeway ramp control based on iterative learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Freeway ramp control based on iterative learning","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4-040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047703S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362513","isNumber":"5362514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362513","xplore-issue":"5362514","articleId":"5363028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5363056,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Afrah","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Afrah","id":"37669999400"},{"name":"Gregor Miller","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Gregor","lastName":"Miller","id":"37403598600"},{"name":"Sidney Fels","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sidney","lastName":"Fels","id":"37268066200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5231-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3890-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5363056","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Libraries","Computer vision","Data mining","Image converters","Multimedia systems","Engineering management","Electric breakdown","Image processing","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-based system development","module reusability","subtask classification","vision classification","data management","data processing","data access","data conversion","data transportation","vision utility"]}],"abstract":"We are addressing two aspects of vision-based system development that are not fully exploited in current frameworks: abstraction over low-level details and high-level module reusability. Through an evaluation of existing frameworks, we relate these shortcomings to the lack of systematic classification of sub-tasks in vision-based system development. In this paper we present our work-in-progress which addresses these two issues by classifying vision into decoupled sub-tasks, hence defining a clear scope for a vision-based system development framework and its sub-components. Firstly, we decompose the task of vision system development into data management and processing. We then proceed to further decompose data management into three components: data access, conversion and transportation. We present the Vision Utility (VU) framework which provides abstraction over the vision system data management and verify this approach through an example vision system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision System Development through Separation of Management and Processing","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2009.124","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362508/5362509/05363056.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2009.124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Vision System Development through Separation of Management and Processing","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5363056/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11023634","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision System Development through Separation of Management and Processing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3890a612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041761S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362508","isNumber":"5362509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362508","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5362509","articleId":"5363056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5363065,"authors":[{"name":"Baoru Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hainan Software Profession Institute, Qionghai, Hainan, China"],"firstName":"Baoru","lastName":"Han","id":"37404890800"},{"name":"Hengyu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hainan Software Profession Institute, Qionghai, Hainan, China"],"firstName":"Hengyu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37405480700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4994-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-7379"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-7387"}],"articleNumber":"5363065","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Analog circuits","Fault diagnosis","Neurons","Circuit faults","Convergence","Adaptive systems","Software algorithms","Circuit simulation","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","backpropagation","circuit analysis computing","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tolerance analog circuit fault diagnosis","wavelet neural network analog circuit fault diagnosis","multiple-input multiple-output compact type","adaptive learning rate","BP algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363065","abstract":"Based on the classical wavelet neural network, this paper put forward a sort of improved multiple-input multiple-output compact type of wavelet neural network, adopted adaptive learning rate and additional momentum BP algorithm to carry out training, studied its tolerance analog circuit fault diagnosis applications.

In OpenMP program model, our methodology avoids that the same memory location is simultaneously modified by more than one thread when the short-range forces is calculated, meanwhile our method reduces memory requirements. The methodology comes from the idea of red-black coloring, popular in linear algebra. We developed the spatial decomposition coloring algorithm, and our work applied this algorithm to implement the embedded atom method formalism for molecular dynamic. In this paper we also describe other optimizing methods applied in our serial and parallel implementations. Results show that our method is scalable and can achieve nearly linear speedup. Additionally we also compared it with other methods which can parallelize reduction operations on irregular array, and we discussed them in detail.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International

The communications between a source MS and a destination MS are carried out with the help of BSs in the multi-hop, distributed manner. To achieve the joint optimization for such WIDCNs, a Stochastic Network Utility Maximization (SNUM) problem is formulated under the constraints of OFDMA sub-channel allocation on time-varying access links (both uplink and downlink), as well as routing and scheduling on forwarding links among BSs. By decomposing the corresponding dual problem, transforming it into a stochastic convex optimization problem and solving it by quasi-gradient method, we obtain distributed dynamic control algorithms for end-to-end data transmission. The algorithm can adapt to the OFMDA channel variation and converges asymptotically to the optimal solution. We also develop a distributed algorithm for OFDMA sub-channel allocation and link coordination between BSs. The simulation results show that the data rates of the flows can converge to optimal solution approximately, queues of the network is stable under the proposed distributed dynamic algorithm, and the multi-receiver scheme outperforms the single-receiver scheme due to diversity.","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2009.20","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362569/5362570/05363233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2009.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362570","startPage":"337","endPage":"343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Control and Resource Allocation in Wireless-Infrastructured Distributed Cellular Networks with OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Control and Resource Allocation in Wireless-Infrastructured Distributed Cellular Networks with OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11025081","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5363233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Control and Resource Allocation in Wireless-Infrastructured Distributed Cellular Networks with OFDMA","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3803a337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086038S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362569","isNumber":"5362570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362569","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5362570","articleId":"5363233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5363241,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-mei Lin","affiliation":["Center of Information and Education Technology, Foshan University, Foshan, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Dong-mei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37650443800"},{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Foshan University, Foshan, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37655887900"},{"name":"Yong Zhong","affiliation":["Center of Information and Education Technology, Foshan University, Foshan, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37534149600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5363241","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363241","abstract":"Taking the example of traveling salesman problem, new heuristic strategy controlling the flight of partial dimensions in the swarm is put forward by analyzing the character existing in the edge-set intersection among particles, in order to resolve the problems of premature convergence and too-slow convergence existing in particle swarm optimization.

NLEA has a linear fitness function in two dimension space so as to evaluate fitness of each individual fast in population. A crossover operator based on density function and a new mutation operator is developed to extend the search space and extract the better solution.

In registrations, we seek an estimate of the transformation that registers the reference image and test image by optimizing their metric function (similarity measure). To date, local optimization techniques, such as the gradient decent method, are frequently used for medical image registrations. But these methods need good initial values for estimation in order to avoid the local minimum. In this paper, we propose a new approach named hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) for medical image registration, which incorporates two concepts (subpopulation and crossover) of genetic algorithms into the conventional PSO. Experimental results with medical volume phantom data show that the proposed HPSO performs much better results than conventional GA and PSO.","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362549/05363336.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.699","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Medical Image Registration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Medical Image Registration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363336/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5363336/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034717","isConference":true,"volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Medical Image Registration","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736f026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08206S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5362549","articleId":"5363336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5363347,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37677935000"},{"name":"Zheng Qin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Qin","id":"37275830200"},{"name":"Mingyue Song","affiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingyue","lastName":"Song","id":"37674454500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4994-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-7379"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-7387"}],"articleNumber":"5363347","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363347","abstract":"Optimization of the similarity measure is an essential theme in medical image registration.

We employ the HPSO algorithm to an example of VRP, and compare its result with those generated by PSO, GA, and parallel PSO algorithms. The experimental comparison results indicate that the performance of HPSO algorithm is superior to others, and it will become an effective approach for solving discrete combinatory problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.353","startPage":"502","endPage":"506","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362493","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362493/05363419.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows: A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363419/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows: A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5363419/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11034319","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows: A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736d502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041333S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5362493","articleId":"5363419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5363435,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

Considering the complexity of response characteristics modeling about efficiency and NOx emission, a hybrid particle swarm optimization with invasive weed (IW-PSO) was proposed to optimize the constrained objective functions. In IW-PSO, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and invasive weed optimization (IWO) were integrated in parallel form, and after some iteration, IWO was considered to assist PSO.

The unique accessibility of the AMOEBA-I is thus fully displayed. The modified PSO method can reduce the computational load and has certain degree of robustness on selecting dimension of particles.

To solve these problems, this paper proposes the tabu search and genetic algorithm (Tabu GA) for generating test data of Java class, which forbids individuals which have already been executed being performed again. The method also presents a coding scheme, which is one-to-one code between problem and its solutions and could present the data of user defined data type.

However, the target tracking mutation system status has poorer filtering precision. In order to overcome the problem of the extended Kalman particle filter, a novel filtering method called the genetic particle filter (GA-EKPF) is proposed in this paper. The genetic mechanism provides an important guiding ideology to solve the deprivation of particles. The proposed algorithm overcomes the deprivation of particles and enhances the filtering precision. Experimental results show that the performance of modified extended Kalman particle filter superiors to the standard particle filter (PF) and some other modified PFs.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.600","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362498/05363676.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method of Genetic Algorithm Optimized Extended Kalman Particle Filter for Nonlinear System State Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization methods","Kalman filters","Particle filters","Nonlinear systems","State estimation","Filtering algorithms","Target tracking","Particle tracking","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","nonlinear systems","state estimation","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","extended Kalman particle filter","suboptimal filtering algorithm","nonlinear system state estimation","nonlinear tracking problem","resampling scheme","target tracking mutation system","genetic particle filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["extended kalman particle filter","genetic algorithm","particle deprivation","re-sampling process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Method of Genetic Algorithm Optimized Extended Kalman Particle Filter for Nonlinear System State Estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5363676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034426","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method of Genetic Algorithm Optimized Extended Kalman Particle Filter for Nonlinear System State Estimation","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736e313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055166S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5362498","articleId":"5363676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5363695,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Guo","affiliation":["Pervasive Computing lab, College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37665722300"},{"name":"Yingzhen Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yingzhen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37677358800"},{"name":"Lian Duan","affiliation":["Department of Management Science, Henry B. tippie College of Business, University of Iowa, Iowa, USA"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Duan","id":"37558136100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5363695","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Event detection","Clustering algorithms","Internet","Educational institutions","Cities and towns","Pervasive computing","Computer science","Computer network management","Environmental management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","digital signatures","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network clustering","anomaly detection","intrusion detection methods","signature detection","clustering algorithm","data training classification"]}],"abstract":"Intrusions impose serious security threat to network environment, so it is necessary to detect and cope with them. Many intrusion detection methods focus on signature detection, where models are built to recognize known attacks. However, signature detection, limited by its nature, cannot detect novel attacks. New intrusion types, of which detection systems may not even be aware, are difficult to detect. Anomaly detection focuses on modeling the normal behavior and identifying significant deviations, which could be novel attacks. In this paper we present a clustering algorithm to identify outliers. It performs clustering on feature vectors collected from the network and can automatically detect new types of intrusions without need of manual classification of training data. Experimental results show that our system achieves a satisfactory intrusions detection rate while keeping the false positive rate reasonably low.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection by Clustering in the Network","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CISE.2009.5363695","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362500/5362501/05363695.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISE.2009.5363695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection by Clustering in the Network","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5363695/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11033701","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection by Clustering in the Network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043425S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362500","isNumber":"5362501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362500","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5362501","articleId":"5363695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5363727,"authors":[{"name":"Shangyou Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shangyou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596151700"},{"name":"Yanfeng Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanfeng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404472200"},{"name":"Baocai Yin","affiliation":["Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Baocai","lastName":"Yin","id":"37268507700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5231-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3890-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5363727","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"abstract":"Recently, in a task of face recognition, some researchers proposed a novel method called Extended Two-Dimensional PCA (E2DPCA) which is an extension to the original 2DPCA for gray face recognition. This method can get a new covariance matrix preserving more local geometric structure information than previous 2DPCA methods and avoid small sample size problem of PCA method. But this approach only considers the global information of face images and only is applied for gray face recognition. Some local information and color information may be ignored. Therefore, in this paper, the sub-pattern technique was combined with E2DPCA based on quaternion matrix for color face recognition. In this paper, this new sub-pattern based E2DPCA(which is called SpE2DPCA) was performed and compared with PCA, 2DPCA, E2DPCA, Sub-pattern PCA(SpPCA) and Sub-pattern 2DPCA(Sp2DPCA) for face recognition. The numerous experiments show that the proposed this novel approach SpE2DPCA based quaternion matrix has better recognition performance than other traditional PCA-based methods for face recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362508/5362509/05363727.pdf","startPage":"630","endPage":"634","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2009.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2009.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Approach Based on Sub-pattern Technique and Extended 2DPCA for Color Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Covariance matrix","Quaternions","Gray-scale","Data mining","Feature extraction","Face detection","Humans","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","face recognition","image colour analysis","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subpattern technique","color face recognition","extended two-dimensional PCA","gray face recognition","covariance matrix","quaternion matrix","SpE2DPCA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quaternion Matrix","Sub-pattern technique","Extended2DPCA","SpE2DPCA","Color Face Recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Approach Based on Sub-pattern Technique and Extended 2DPCA for Color Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5363727/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11023643","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Approach Based on Sub-pattern Technique and Extended 2DPCA for Color Face Recognition","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3890a630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059836S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362508","isNumber":"5362509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362508","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5362509","articleId":"5363727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5363758,"authors":[{"name":"Changlu Zheng","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology College of Mechatronics Engineering, Shaghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Changlu","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37673039900"},{"name":"Jian Fan","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Fan","id":"37668492000"},{"name":"MinRui Fei","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology College of Mechatronics Engineering, Shaghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"MinRui","lastName":"Fei","id":"37273075100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5363758","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":424},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-term control","Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Neurons","Fuzzy systems","Control system synthesis","Lighting control","Temperature control","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boilers","fluidised beds","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","gradient methods","neurocontrollers","temperature control","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PID neural network control","fuzzy neural network","gradient descent method","bed temperature control","CFB boiler","steady performance","dynamic performance","circulating fluidized bed"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363758","abstract":"A kind of PID neural network control on the basis of fuzzy neural network model is proposed in this paper, which combines the fuzzy neural network model with the PID neural network.

Experiments show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.83","startPage":"308","endPage":"312","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362587/05363841.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Task Scheduling Problem for Distributed Sensor Network with Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Processor scheduling","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Physics computing","Educational institutions","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Mathematics","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","particle swarm optimisation","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task scheduling problem","distributed sensor network","discrete particle swarm optimization","NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem","particle position code","approximate optimal waiting approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Solving Task Scheduling Problem for Distributed Sensor Network with Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5363841/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034840","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Task Scheduling Problem for Distributed Sensor Network with Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736c308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064505S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","xplore-issue":"5362587","articleId":"5363841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5363883,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaxin Yuan","affiliation":["The School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, China"],"firstName":"Jiaxin","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37678326800"},{"name":"Xiaofang Su","affiliation":["Hubei University of education, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofang","lastName":"Su","id":"37667986000"},{"name":"Baichao Chen","affiliation":["The School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, China"],"firstName":"Baichao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37441275000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5363883","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Pulse width modulation inverters","Switching loss","Space vector pulse width modulation","Space technology","Switching circuits","RLC circuits","Genetic mutations","Voltage control","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-objective genetic algorithm","voltage-source type inverter","fitness function optimization","PWM methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["algorithm","inverter","multi-objective optimization","switching loss"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363883","abstract":"There is many control strategies used in the inverter.

This paper addresses to a clonal selection algorithm (CSA) that is one of the most representative IA and was applied into the protein structure prediction (PSP) on AB off-lattice model, in which the memory B cells of the CSA was innovated by employing different strategies: local search and global search in the phase of the mutation. And the CSA was further improved by adding aging operator to combat the premature convergence. However the pure aging operator didn't achieve effective results and sometimes the optimum solution was eliminated. To resolve this problem, the current best solution was reserved by an antibody and it was not eliminated when its age reached its life span. In our experiments the improved algorithm was compared with the standard CSA and the pure aging CSA, which of the results demonstrated that the improved strategy with the memory B cells and long life aging was very effective to overcome premature convergence and to avoid trapped in the local-best solution, and it was also effective in keeping the diversity of the small size population.","doi":"10.1109/ICINIS.2009.175","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Intelligent Networks and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362495/5362496/05363926.pdf","startPage":"685","endPage":"688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINIS.2009.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clonal Selection Algorithm with Aging Operators for Protein Structure Prediction on AB Off-Lattice Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5363926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5363926/","displayDocTitle":"Clonal Selection Algorithm with Aging Operators for Protein Structure Prediction on AB Off-Lattice Model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11024338","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5363926/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clonal Selection Algorithm with Aging Operators for Protein Structure Prediction on AB Off-Lattice Model","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3852a685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055402S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362495","isNumber":"5362496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362495","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5362496","articleId":"5363926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5363973,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Now we present the contribution that these new operators bring to this field, comparing them with similar versions present in the literature that do not use local search mechanisms. For this purpose, we have tested different configurations of mutation operators in eight BAliBASE alignments, taking conclusions regarding population evolution and quality of the final results.

The network structure and its on-line learning algorithm using delta adaptation law of the RWNN are described in detail.

In function approximation applications, when a functional relationship between input and output variables is supposed to exist, the presence of data where the similar set of input variables is associated to very different values of the output is not always beneficial for the final system to design. A method is presented which can be used to detect anomalous data, namely non-coherent associations between input and output patterns. This technique, by mean of a comparison between two distance matrix associated to the input and output patterns, is able to detect elements in a dataset, where similar values of input variables are associated to quite different output values. A numerical example and a more complex application in the pre-processing of data coming from an industrial database were presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on

The Elman neural network observer can be considered as a special kind of feed-forward neural network with additional memory neurons and local feedback. Because of the context neurons and local recurrent connections between the context layer and the hidden layer, it facilitates the nonlinear states estimation for the sensorless control of PMLSM. The Elman neural network is trained both off-line and on-line. In the off-line training process with the training data, the connective weights of the Elman neural network are trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, while on-line learning, the connective weights of the Elman neural network are trained using supervised gradient decent method.

Bit error rate (BER) of BPSK-OFDM based WLAN in presence of Bluetooth (BT) interference using rectangular BT spectrum is given in some previous work. But it is seen actual BT spectrum is non rectangular. So when Bluetooth's interference power will be high with respect to WLAN's power BER or symbol error rate (SER) of WLAN obtained using rectangular BT spectrum will not match with actual values of BER or SER in presence of Bluetooth interference. The reason is leakage effect in other sub carriers with respect to the sub carriers where Bluetooth has actually hopped is not considered in case of rectangular BT spectrum. In this paper we propose a interference model to find the power of Bluetooth (BT) interference for each sub-carrier of an OFDM based WLAN. Then using sub carrier power to interference power ratio symbol error rate (SER) for each WLAN sub-carrier is obtained in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel. Finally average SER for the MQAM-OFDM based WLAN in presence of Bluetooth interference is given. Comparisons of BER or SER using the proposed model with the model of rectangular BT spectrum are given.. From the results it is seen that SER or BER curves using proposed model is closely matching with the actual SER or BER curves.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of MQAM OFDM based WLAN System in presence of bluetooth interference with AWGN and rayleigh fading channel","publicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing","doi":"10.4108/ICST.COLLABORATECOM2009.8280","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5353246/5362572/05364046.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.4108/ICST.COLLABORATECOM2009.8280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5364046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of MQAM OFDM based WLAN System in presence of bluetooth interference with AWGN and rayleigh fading channel","conferenceDate":"11-14 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5364046/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of MQAM OFDM based WLAN System in presence of bluetooth interference with AWGN and rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"040paper8280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08711S","chronDate":"11-14 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5353246","isNumber":"5362572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353246","xplore-issue":"5362572","articleId":"5364046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5364083,"authors":[{"name":"Xiannuan Liang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiannuan","lastName":"Liang","id":"37310886800"},{"name":"Yang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37277582300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-9799-76-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5364083","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"abstract":"In this paper, we study a true coalition formation of three robots (i.e., 2 robots vs. 1 robot) in order to detect and capture intrusions in a curved loop.

When the number of variables in Bayesian Network is large, the process of searching is likely to fall into premature convergence and return a local optimal network structure. A new approach for Bayesian Networks structure learning, which is based on the discrete Binary Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, is introduced. The proposed approach is used to find a Bayesian Network that best matches sample data sets. For evaluating the best matching degree between Bayesian Network and sample data sets, Bayesian Information Criterion score is proposed. Then ASIA network, a benchmarks of Bayesian Networks, is used to test the new approach. The results of experiment show that the proposed technique converges more rapidly than other evolutionary computation methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364103/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11034737","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5364103/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks Based on Discrete Binary Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks Based on Discrete Binary Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736f086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076372S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5362549","articleId":"5364103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5364123,"authors":[{"name":"Wang He","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"He","id":"38276373200"},{"name":"Chen Zhi-mei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhi-mei","id":"38276082900"},{"name":"Zhang Jing-gang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jing-gang","id":"38273471300"},{"name":"Meng Wen-jun","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Wen-jun","id":"38277255700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5364123","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sliding mode control","Genetic algorithms","Control systems","Trajectory","System performance","Robustness","Nonlinear systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Robot control","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","genetic algorithms","mobile robots","position control","tracking","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["terminal sliding mode control","multi-degree-of-freedom","genetic algorithm","trajectory tracking control","robot","system state variables","chattering","simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["terminal sliding mode control","GA","robust","chattering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5364123","abstract":"According to trajectory tracking of robot, a method of a terminal sliding model controller based on genetic algorithms is presented.

The interest in finding an optimal partitioning especially in VLSI design has been a hot issue in recent years. In VLSI circuit partitioning, the problem of obtaining a minimum cut is of prime importance. In this paper, a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithm is proposed for the optimization of VLSI intercomnection (netlist) bipartition. Meanwhile, the corresponding evaluation function and the operators of crossover and mutation are designed. The algorithm is implemented to test ISCAS89 benchmark circuits. Compared with the traditional genetic algorithm (GA) with the same evaluation function and the same genetic operators concerned above, partitioning results by DPSO algorithm is markedly improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discrete PSO for Partitioning in VLSI Circuit","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CISE.2009.5364339","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362500/5362501/05364339.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISE.2009.5364339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5364339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Discrete PSO for Partitioning in VLSI Circuit","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5364339/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11033810","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Discrete PSO for Partitioning in VLSI Circuit","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04345S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362500","isNumber":"5362501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362500","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5362501","articleId":"5364339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5364342,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Saint John''s University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"38184468900"},{"name":"Li-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Saint John''s University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37677042600"},{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Saint John''s University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Liu","id":"37673199700"},{"name":"Hung-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37560131900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3819-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5364342","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5364342","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimal scheduling","Water resources","Thermal loading","Cost function","Power generation","Reservoirs","Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydroelectric generators","hydroelectric power stations","particle swarm optimisation","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydro generation scheduling","particle swarm optimization","encoding/decoding","thermal units","evolutionary process","actual utility system","hydro plants"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","hydro generation scheduling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEET.2009.137","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362516/5362519/05364342.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Energy and Environment Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Energy and Environment Technology","startPage":"541","endPage":"544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEET.2009.137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization to Hydro Generation Scheduling","abstract":"This paper presents new solution methods and results based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) for solving the hydro generation scheduling problem. Complete solution algorithms and encoding/decoding techniques are proposed in the paper. The optimal schedules of both hydro and thermal units are concurrently obtained within the evolutionary process of evaluation functions. Significantly, no hydro-thermal iteration is needed.

The results indicate the attractive properties of the PSO approach in practical application, namely, a highly optimal solution cost and more robust convergence behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364342/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11069112","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5364342/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization to Hydro Generation Scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization to Hydro Generation Scheduling","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"3819a541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04509S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362516","isNumber":"5362519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362516","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5362519","articleId":"5364342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5364366,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Minshui","affiliation":["Wuhan Polytechnic, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Minshui","id":"37088094192"},{"name":"Li Jie","affiliation":["School of Environment and Civil Engineering, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CHINA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jie","id":"37535683900"},{"name":"Zhu Hong-ping","affiliation":["School of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CHINA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Hong-ping","id":"38275759000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5364366","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"abstract":"An improved genetic algorithm-based damage identification method is presented that accurately identifies both the location and severity of damage in a simulated simply supported beam. Damage identification based on finite element model updating is often used and damage is identified by minimizing the error between measured and analytical results. But whether model updating can be carried out successfully mainly depends on accuracy of model, quality of vibration testing, definition of optimization problem and calculation performance of optimization algorithm. In the paper, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is presented firstly, the construction technique of objective function based on different residuals and their weight coefficients is introduced secondly, in the end through the simulation of a simply supported beam, and damage identification is studied comparatively. From the results it can be seen that the damage identification method developed using IGA provides greater accuracy in identifying the location and severity of damage, and the performance is better when frequency residual has a larger weight coefficient.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","Civil engineering","Structural

Because insulator has complex operating environment and its infection factors interact on each other, the diagnosis of insulator running state is very difficult. It is needed to use some useful information to conclude insulator operating state. Here, RBF neural network is employed to identify and predict the needed time signals. In order to overcome the shortcoming of general RBF net that convergence speed is slow and plunge local extremum easily, a practical learning algorithm was proposed for adjusting the node number, centers and width of Gaussian function of hidden layer nodes effectively. Off-line training and on-line identifying were combined together to train networks and identify wire net signal.

Experiment results show that the good solution quality is obtained from combination of a larger size of neighborhood and a intermediate size of disaster.","doi":"10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5364398","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362513/5362514/05364398.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5364398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Cellular Genetic Algorithms with Disaster: The Size of Disaster Effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Cellular Genetic Algorithms with Disaster: The Size of Disaster Effects","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11033092","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5364398/","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Cellular Genetic Algorithms with Disaster: The Size of Disaster Effects","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"5-139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046791S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362513","isNumber":"5362514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5362514","articleId":"5364398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5364439,"authors":[{"name":"Pruet Boonma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Boston, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Pruet","lastName":"Boonma","id":"37298420800"},{"name":"Junichi Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Boston, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37290996900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5619-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3920-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"}],"articleNumber":"5364439","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Artificial intelligence","Computer science","USA Councils","Equations","Degradation","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["confidence-based dominance operator","evolutionary algorithms","noisy multiobjective optimization problems","noise-aware dominance operator","noise distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiobjective optimization","Evolutionary Algorithm","Noise-Aware"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a noise-aware dominance operator for evolutionary algorithms to solve the multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) that contain noise in their objective functions. This operator takes objective value samples of given two individuals (or solution candidates), estimates the impacts of noise on the samples and determines whether it is confident enough to judge which one is superior/inferior between the two individuals. Since the proposed operator assumes no noise distributions a priori, it is well applicable to various MOPs whose objective functions follow unknown noise distributions.

This paper brings some traditional algorithms and insights together to construct a framework for a new field called Supermarket Monitoring. Unlike the common surveillance system, the whole body was tracked. In our project, only the moving hands are considered. To fulfill the automated monitoring task, the self-adaptive background subtraction technique and the YIQ skin color model are combined to detect the moving hands. In order to accurate localization at palm, a new method is developed. After successfully detecting the moving hands, a linear prediction model is cited to realize the object tracking.

Based on the average time-delayed correlation matrices, a new kind of plural blind source separation method using the singular value decomposition is proposed. The array manifold is estimated based on it. Then combining the complex blind source separation method with the high resolution method, a new kind of method for DOA estimation is proposed. Namely, the array signal is separated firstly, then reconstructing the array signal according to the separation matrix and separated signals. Lastly the DOA is estimated by minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming method. And this new method was tested by the narrowband simulation data. Results show that this method can complete the real-time estimation of the target orientation and estimate the number of targets. And this new method is superior to the single MVDR method in the request of the sensors number, signal-to-noise and snapshots number to achieve the same results under same condition. At the same time, it has higher resolution than single MVDR algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Kind of Method for DOA Estimation Based on Blind Source Separation and MVDR Beamforming","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.10","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362506/05364601.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362506","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5364601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Kind of Method for DOA Estimation Based on Blind Source Separation and MVDR Beamforming","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5364601/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11024378","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Kind of Method for DOA Estimation Based on Blind Source Separation and MVDR Beamforming","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736b486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050492S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5362506","articleId":"5364601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5364611,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenchao Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenchao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37675496900"},{"name":"Haibin Duan","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Duan","id":"37312778300"},{"name":"Xiangyin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37675606000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5364611","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1651},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Traveling salesman problems","Greedy algorithms","Genetic mutations","Optimization methods","Automation","Electronic mail","Hybrid power systems","Testing","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","greedy algorithms","search problems","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved greedy genetic algorithm","travelling salesman problem","initial population","local search ability","hybrid algorithms","optimal solution","complex optimization problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm (GA)","Greedy algorithm","Improved greedy genetic algorithm (IGAA)","Traveling Salesman Problem","Base point"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5364611","abstract":"Genetic algorithm (GA) is too dependent on the initial population and a lack of local search ability.

In order to model normal behaviors accurately and improve the performance of intrusion detection, a joint evolutionary neural network (JENN) is presented in this paper. Input features, network structure and connection weights are evolved jointly using genetic algorithm. To evolve all three tasks jointly, a hybrid representation scheme is employed, and penalty factors for the number of input nodes and hidden nodes are introduced into fitness function. The generated-subnet based crossover operator is adopted in consideration of the relationship between genotype and phenotype.

Since the dawn of this discipline, much work based on different techniques has been published which shows that traffic signs can be first detected and then classified in video sequences in real time. While detection is usually performed using classical computer vision techniques based on color and/or shape matching, most often classification is performed by neural networks. In this work we present a novel approach based on both sign shape and color which uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for detection. Remarkably, a single fitness function can be used both to detect a sign belonging to a certain category and, at the same time, to estimate its actual position with respect to the camera reference frame. To speed up execution times, the algorithm exploits the parallelism offered by modern graphics cards and, in particular, the CUDA\u00bf architecture by nVIDIA. The effectiveness of the approach has been assessed on a synthetic video sequence, which has been successfully processed in real time at full frame rate.","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362793/5362794/05364748.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-Based Road Sign Detection Using Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2009.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2009.88","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5364748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Based Road Sign Detection Using Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036518","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5364748/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Based Road Sign Detection Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3872a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049777S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362793","isNumber":"5362794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362793","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5362794","articleId":"5364748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5364768,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this space, each classifier or individual is represented by the set of the accuracies of the classifier for each class of the problem. The proposed sensitivity clustering is able to obtain groups of individuals that perform similarly for the different classes. Then, a representative of each group is selected and it is improved by a local search procedure. This method is applied in specific stages of the evolutionary process. The sensitivity clustering process is compared to a clustering process applied over the Tridimensional space that represent the behaviour of the classifier over each training pattern, where n is the number of patterns. This second method clearly results in a higher computational cost. The comparison is performed in ten imbalanced datasets, including the minimum sensitivity results (i.e. the accuracy for the worst classified class). The results indicate that, although in general the differences are not significant, the sensitivity clustering obtains the best performance for almost all datasets both in accuracy and minimum sensitivity, involving a lower computational demand.","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2009.209","startPage":"187","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent

continuous weights, and its characteristic tidy memory capacity in embedded systems, a neural network optimization method is proposed. Firstly, we represent the weights of neural network with integers and train the neural network using the genetic algorithm. Secondly, the continuous nonlinear-activation function of the neuron is transformed into discrete and linear function using the least-squares arithmetic. Then, the optimized neural network is applied to the image sharpening for verifying its feasibility. Results of experiment show that the new method has a good real time capability and effect in hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364769/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11034640","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5364769/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Research on Real-Time Image Sharpening Methods Based on Optimized Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Real-Time Image Sharpening Methods Based on Optimized Neural Network","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736b424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06047S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5362506","articleId":"5364769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5364773,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Currently, several physical-statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) wind speed prediction models are used to this end. A recently proposed hybrid model is based on hybridizations of global and mesoscale forecasting systems, with a final downscaling step using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In this paper, we test an alternative neural model for this final step of downscaling, in which projection hyperbolic tangent units (HTUs) are used within feed forward neural networks. The architecture, weights and node typology of the HTU-based network are learnt using a hybrid evolutionary programming algorithm. This new methodology is tested over a real problem of wind speed forecasting, in which we show that our method is able to improve the performance of previous MLPs, obtaining an interpretable model of final regression for each turbine in the wind park.","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2009.30","startPage":"193","endPage":"198","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362793/5362794/05364773.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2009.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperbolic Tangent Basis Function Neural Networks Training by Hybrid Evolutionary Programming for Accurate Short-Term Wind Speed Prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Functional programming","Genetic programming","Wind speed","Predictive models","Wind forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Testing","Wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","evolutionary computation","feedforward neural nets","forecasting theory","perceptrons","wind","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperbolic tangent basis function","neural networks training","hybrid evolutionary programming","short term wind speed prediction","wind parks management","physical statistical artificial intelligence","wind speed prediction models","proposed hybrid model","mesoscale forecasting systems","final downscaling step","multilayer perceptron","alternative neural model","projection hyperbolic tangent units","feed forward neural networks","HTU based network","evolutionary programming algorithm","wind speed forecasting","wind park turbine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Short-term wind speed forecasting","Global forecast models","Downscaling","Hyperbolic Tangent Neural networks","Evolutionary Programming","Hybrid Algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hyperbolic Tangent Basis Function Neural Networks Training by Hybrid Evolutionary Programming for Accurate Short-Term Wind Speed Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5364773/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11047795","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperbolic Tangent Basis Function Neural Networks Training by Hybrid Evolutionary Programming for Accurate Short-Term Wind Speed Prediction","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3872a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062548S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362793","isNumber":"5362794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362793","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5362794","articleId":"5364773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5364779,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Miguel F.

In this context, the wavelength converter allocation problem has become a key factor to minimize blocking. The wavelength converter allocation problem has been treated as a mono-objective problem minimizing the number of wavelength converters or minimizing blocking; however, both criteria are in conflict with each other. Therefore, the wavelength converter allocation problem is studied here in a pure multi-objective optimization context for more appropriate decision making. This work proposes a multi-objective optimization approach based on an evolutionary algorithm which simultaneously minimizes blocking and the number of wavelength converters. Extensive simulations on three real optical networks show promising results in the sense that our algorithm generates the trade-off curve between blocking and the number of converters needed, and outperforms a recently proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2009.56","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362793/5362794/05364898.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"419","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2009.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelength Converter Allocation in Optical Networks: An Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5364898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wavelength Converter Allocation in Optical Networks: An Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11036539","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5364898/","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelength Converter Allocation in Optical Networks: An Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Approach","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3872a414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072492S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362793","isNumber":"5362794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362793","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5362794","articleId":"5364898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5364957,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Lin","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37676914900"},{"name":"Yan-feng Qiao","affiliation":["Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Yan-feng","lastName":"Qiao","id":"38104237700"},{"name":"Wan-xin Su","affiliation":["Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Wan-xin","lastName":"Su","id":"37673172800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4994-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-7379"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-7387"}],"articleNumber":"5364957","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Physics","Estimation error","Finite impulse response filter","Mathematical model","Degradation","MATLAB","Error correction","Phase noise","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware description languages","mathematics computing","mobile communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile OFDM carrier frequency offset","step-size estimation model","algorithmic stability","mathematic model","stepsize estimation algorithm","MATLAB simulation","interleaver modulation","subcarrier modulation","VHDL","circuit board"]}],"abstract":"In order to maintain orthogonality among subcarriers for mobile OFDM, a CFOs step-size estimation model is established to avoid severe performance degradation caused by ICI, and algorithmic stability, step-size parameter, the error of CFOs estimate and etc are investigated.

In this work, GMM parameters estimation was performed through a variation of the well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that was developed within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, the adopted mixture learning technique incorporates a built-in mechanism for automatically assessing the number of components during the parameter estimation procedure. Then, generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is considered for detecting anomalies.

Given the hop interval, the FH signals can be identified and the hopping frequencies can be estimated with a tiny number of measurements.

The continuous monitoring and the automatic detection of arrhythmias of the heart may help specialists to perform a faster diagnostic. The main contribution of this work is to show that self-organized artificial neural networks (ANNs), as the ART2, can be applied in arrhythmias automatic detection, working with Wavelet transforms for feature extraction. The self-organized ANN allows, at any time, the inclusion of other groups of arrhythmias, without the need of a new complete training phase.

The cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO), can significantly improve the performance of the original algorithm. However, CPSO has the defect of leading to pseudominimizer, which can not be easily escaped by interleaving the CPSO and PSO algorithm. Therefore, we take full advantages of the characteristics of ergodicity and randomness of chaotic variables to help the particles escape from pseudominimizer and converge to global optimum. The experimental results on some benchmark functions show that TCCPSO outperforms the CPSO. In addition, simulation results show that algorithm computation precision is increased and that the algorithm convergence is improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5365043/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11033290","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5365043/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Chaotic Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Tent Map","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Tent Map","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"2-017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079647S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362513","isNumber":"5362514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362513","xplore-issue":"5362514","articleId":"5365043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5365051,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An example and comparison are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5365335/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11023857","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5365335/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Global Robust Exponential Stability for a Class of Delayed Reaction-Diffusion Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Robust Exponential Stability for a Class of Delayed Reaction-Diffusion Neural Network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01-02-077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109867S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362500","isNumber":"5362501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362500","xplore-issue":"5362501","articleId":"5365335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5365337,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37675720600"},{"name":"Mingyan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37270835500"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5365337","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Hopfield neural networks","Wireless mesh networks","Frequency conversion","Constraint optimization","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Delay effects","Optimization methods","Greedy algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","greedy algorithms","Hopfield neural nets","matrix algebra","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication computing","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer resource allocation optimization","Hopfield neural networks","OFDMA-based wireless mesh networks","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","system maximization","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","time delay constraint","bit-loading matrix"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel method based on Hopfield neural networks (HNN) for cross-layer dynamical resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based wireless mesh networks (WMN).

floating-car data measured from urban links, some data-processing techniques including data mending, wavelet de-noise and others are used to establish a time series of data to better reflect the original running characteristic of urban links. On this basis, the travel time forecasting researches are executed both by the BP neural network based on Bayesian Regularization algorithm and the genetic algorithm based on BP network. In this period, several prediction schemes are designed according to different network architecture and sample data. What's more, the validity evaluation and the results contrast are performed. The experiments prove that the genetic algorithm based on BP artificial neural network is more practical and can improve the precision better.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5365470/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5365470/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034515","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Travel Time Prediction Method for Urban Expressway Link Based on Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Travel Time Prediction Method for Urban Expressway Link Based on Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736a358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057619S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5362504","articleId":"5365470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5365543,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Jie","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Science and, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Jie","id":"37669676300"},{"name":"Wang Chenghua","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Science and, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Chenghua","id":"37681058700"},{"name":"Hong Feng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Science and, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37668651100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3819-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5365543","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Pulse width modulation inverters","Bridge circuits","Stress","Pulse width modulation","Topology","Frequency","Low voltage","Inductors","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","semiconductor diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diode-clamped three-level dual buck inverter","bipolar PWM waveform","voltage stress","unipolar PWM output waveforms","half load-cycle operation mode","bridge voltage","magnetic component"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverter","Three-level","Half bridge","Integrated Magnetics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5365543","doi":"10.1109/ICEET.2009.269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEET.2009.269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362517","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Energy and Environment Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Energy and Environment Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362516/5362517/05365543.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diode-Clamped Three-Level Dual Buck Inverter","abstract":"Dual Buck inverter(DBI) is a new topology which has the characteristics of high frequency and efficiency.

To overcome these problems, a novel three-level DBI, which has unipolar PWM output waveforms and low voltage stress, is presented in this paper. And the half load-cycle operation mode of DBI is remained in it. But over-voltage may occur if the current of inductor is discontinuous. To solve this problem, a diode-clamped three-level DBI is adopted, then the bridge voltage could be clamped, the volume and weight of magnetic component are reduced at the same time. The merits of DBI such as high efficiency and reliability are remained at the same time.

Novel approaches to feature extraction based on the nonlinear Teager energy operator (TEO) calculated within critical bands, discrete wavelet transform bands, and wavelet packet bands are presented. The classification process was performed using two types of neural networks: the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and the probabilistic neural network (PNN). The classification efficiency was tested using the actual stress dataset from the SUSAS database. The speech recordings were made by 15 speakers (8 females and 7 males) reading a list of 35 words under three actual conditions: high stress, low stress, and neutral. The best overall performance was observed for the features extracted using the TEO parameters calculated within perceptual wavelet packet bands(TEO-PWP). Depending on the type of mother wavelet, the correct classification scores for the PWP features ranged from 71.24% to 91.56% (using the MLPNN classifier), and from 86.63% to 93.67% (using the PNN). The PNN classifier outperformed the MLPNN classification method.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.56","startPage":"227","endPage":"231","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362506/05365560.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Networks and TEO Features for an Automatic Recognition of Stress in Spontaneous Speech","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Automatic speech recognition","Stress","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet packets","Multi-layer neural network","Feature extraction","Speech analysis","Multilayer perceptrons","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","multilayer perceptrons","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","TEO features","automatic recognition","spontaneous speech stress","automatic stress recognition methods","nonlinear Teager energy operator","discrete wavelet transform","wavelet packet bands","multilayer perceptron neural network","MLPNN","probabilistic neural network","stress dataset","SUSAS database","feature extraction","perceptual wavelet packet bands"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MLPNN","PNN","TEO features","stress and emotion recognition","speech classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5365560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural Networks and TEO Features for an Automatic Recognition of Stress in Spontaneous Speech","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5365560/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034652","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Networks and TEO Features for an Automatic Recognition of Stress in Spontaneous Speech","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736b227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068494S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5362506","articleId":"5365560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5365561,"authors":[{"name":"Yanxia Hu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanxia","lastName":"Hu","id":"37896820100"},{"name":"Na Ma","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Ma","id":"37670405700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5365561","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5365561","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Asymptotic stability","Linear matrix inequalities","Sufficient conditions","Delay effects","Computer networks","Physics computing","Mathematics","Delay lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","cellular neural nets","delays","linear matrix inequalities","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural networks stability","time-varying delay","global asymptotic stability","delayed cellular neural networks","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Delay","Linear matrix inequality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.74","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362587/05365561.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"486","endPage":"489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Result on Stability of Cellular Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delay","abstract":"In a recent paper written by Yu et al., a sufficient condition on the existence of unique equilibrium point and its global asymptotic stability for delayed cellular neural networks (DCNNs) is proposed.

One subpopulation consists of the top individuals of the current population and employs scheme DE/best/1/bin to improve the convergence speed by learning the non-dominated individuals; the other is composed of the rest individuals of the current population and uses scheme DE/rand/2/bin to improve and guarantee the convergence rate. Through validating the two performance metrics on three benchmark multi-objective optimization test problems, the presented algorithm is compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms.

There is not a fixed lighting in the heating kiln, and the illumination would change gradually with the change of temperature in the heating kiln. Background subtraction is the most popular and simple detection method used in quickly detecting and tracking moving object from images. However, it would extract false object information as the illumination changes. This paper proposes a novel multi-background images model for detecting the moving billet in the heating kiln using particle swarm optimization. The algorithm extracts a current background image from these multi-representative background images, which extracts from the sensed images data in off-line learning. This billet location control system gets a good control performance in a workshop.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Particle swarm optimization","Billets","Heating","Kilns","Data mining","Lighting","Object detection","Control systems","Temperature control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["billets","image motion analysis","kilns","lighting control","object detection","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust moving-object detecting method","particle swarm optimization","billet location control","heating kiln","illumination","multi-representative background images"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.394","startPage":"195","endPage":"199","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362587/05365732.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Moving-Object Detecting Method Using Particle Swarm Optimization for a Billet Location Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Robust Moving-Object Detecting Method Using Particle Swarm Optimization for a Billet Location Control","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11034885","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5365732/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5365732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Moving-Object Detecting Method Using Particle Swarm Optimization for a Billet Location Control","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736c195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13137S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","xplore-issue":"5362587","articleId":"5365732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5365748,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mehedi Hassan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mehedi","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37394952400"},{"name":"Biao Song","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Song","id":"37671655500"},{"name":"Seung-Min Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Min","lastName":"Han","id":"37674755100"},{"name":"Eui-Nam Huh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eui-Nam","lastName":"Huh","id":"37326597300"},{"name":"Changwoo Yoon","affiliation":["IPTV Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changwoo","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37391263700"},{"name":"Won Ryu","affiliation":["IPTV Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37284337600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5619-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3920-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"}],"articleNumber":"5365748","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5365748","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a promising multi-objective (MO) optimization model for partner selection in a market-oriented dynamic collaboration (DC) platform of cloud providers (CPs) to minimize the conflicts among providers that may happen when negotiating among providers.

The results which show that the product of the maximum overshoot and the angular frequency of damped oscillation approximately equal to 1 when the angular frequency belongs to (0.65\u00bf, 0.35\u00bf) are the promising guidelines for parameter selection in PSO. Moreover, comparisons are made between research results both in opened literatures and this paper in order to show the validity of the new guidelines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5365850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034887","htmlLink":"/document/5365850/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Guidelines for Parameter Selection in Particle Swarm Optimization According to Control Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guidelines for Parameter Selection in Particle Swarm Optimization According to Control Theory","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736c520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073384S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5362587","articleId":"5365850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5365853,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Ma","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37675928400"},{"name":"Donglai Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Donglai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291866300"},{"name":"Dianguo Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Dianguo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278438500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5365853","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5365853","abstract":"In hydraulic system of the roof supports of longwall coal mining face, electromagnetic valve translates the electrical control signals to hydraulic signals to realize the roof support, coal mining, and the advance of longwall face. Thus, it is important to identify current as well as future conditions of electromagnetic valves to avoid unexpected failure. Most of fault diagnosis and maintenance methods mainly focus on short or open circuit failure detection and regular replacement, detection, and repair. In contrast, this paper develops real-time fault detection and degradation failure prediction methods for intrinsically safe electromagnetic valve used in underground longwall coal mining based on coil current. The analytical relationship of the force, air gap, and coil driving current are analyzed according to the mechanical kinematical character of electromagnetic actuator in the valve, and an experimental setup is developed to perform accelerated electromagnetic valve tests while the coil current information is collected from two types of electromagnetic valves that are running until failure. This information is then used for real-time detection on validity of switching activity and for degradation feature extraction. The neural network is used for degradation failure classification and prediction. The results has shown that the discrimination of 5 levels of degradation failure for the two types of tested valves can reach 92.5% and 99.3% respectively, and that the developed method can be an effective assistant for maintenance of mining used electromagnetic valve.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.225","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362506/05365853.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation Failure Prediction from Coil Current Signals of Electromagnetic Valves in Coal Mining Based on Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Coils","Valves","Neural networks","Electromagnetic forces","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","Electromagnetic analysis","Failure analysis","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coal","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","hydraulic systems","mining industry","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degradation failure prediction","coil current signals","electromagnetic valves","neural network","hydraulic system","real-time fault detection","underground longwall coal mining","degradation failure classification","mining maintenance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["longwall coal mining","hydraulic","electromagnetic valve","degradation failure prediction","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5365853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Degradation Failure Prediction from Coil Current Signals of Electromagnetic Valves in Coal Mining Based on Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5365853/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034659","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation Failure Prediction from Coil Current Signals of Electromagnetic Valves in Coal Mining Based on Neural Network","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736b208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062986S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5362506","articleId":"5365853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5365960,"authors":[{"name":"Xueli Wu","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China","Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Xueli","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407325100"},{"name":"Wenxia Du","affiliation":["Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China","Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Wenxia","lastName":"Du","id":"37532599200"},{"name":"Fan-hua Meng","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China","Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Fan-hua","lastName":"Meng","id":"37684305600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5365960","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Cellular neural networks","Neural networks","Delay effects","Asymptotic stability","Sufficient conditions","State feedback","Computer networks","Electronic mail","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","cellular neural nets","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delayed cellular neural network","time-varying delay","delay-dependent global asymptotically robust stability condition","Lyapunov function","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["delayed cellular neural networks (DCNNs)","Lyapunov functional","LMI","global asymptotically robust stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5365960","abstract":"In the paper, a novel method is proposed for global asymptotically robust stability of cellular neural networks with time-varying delay.

The multipliers based on canonic signed-digit (CSD) are used to optimize the design of the 9/7 float wavelet finite impulse response digital filter. This architecture is a pipeline and memory efficient, improving the implementation of the 2D-DWT by adopting an efficient usage of hardware resources, low control complexity; and reducing the embedded memory requirements and external memory access. Based on the line-based architecture, the column processor can start column wise transform while only five rows have been processed. For an 2N \u00d7 2N image, only 11 \u00d7 2N internal memory is required for the 9/7 float 2-D DWT.

However, traditional classifiers are often referred to as point or pixel-based classifiers in that they label a pixel on the basis of its spectral properties alone. In this paper, we present a new context-sensitive neural network classifier, which take into account the spatial context information, using fuzzy method and probabilistic label relaxation. The experiment result shows that the new classifier can reduce some isolated mislabeling and improve the accuracy. The spatial coherence of the classes improved.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.379","startPage":"565","endPage":"569","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362587","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362587/05366070.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fuzzy Context Neural Network Classifier for Land Cover Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5366070/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Fuzzy Context Neural Network Classifier for Land Cover Classification","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5366070/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11034892","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fuzzy Context Neural Network Classifier for Land Cover Classification","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736c565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047908S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5362587","articleId":"5366070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5366074,"authors":[{"name":"Jianguang Weng","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Media and Communications, China"],"firstName":"Jianguang","lastName":"Weng","id":"37667388400"},{"name":"Xiaowen Jia","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Media and Communications, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Jia","id":"37671028300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3736-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"5366074","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Tree graphs","Target recognition","Computer networks","Embedded computing","Portable computers","Search engines","Paramagnetic resonance","Decision trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","hidden Markov models","search problems","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory-efficient graph structured composite-state network","embedded speech recognition","low-resource portable devices","memory-efficient search space representation","HMM model","suffix part redundancy","topological structure","memory footprint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","HMM","composite-state network"]}],"abstract":"There is a great demand to optimize the search engine of embedded speech recognition (ESR) system to make it applicable for low-resource portable devices.

Our approach combines two vital models: (1) a latency model for connection establishment that captures the interactions between web browsers and web servers across network protocol layers and (2) a server performance model based on queueing theory that models performance across all tiers of a server complex. An algorithm capable of enforcing the optimal admission control based on the inter-arrival time between pageview admissions is given. Our approach has been implemented and evaluated in an experimental setting, demonstrating how CP-MDO achieves the minimal cost while providing minimal pageview response times under minimal drop rates across multiple classes of service.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366184","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5353818/5362673/05366184.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connection and performance model driven optimization of pageview response time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Connection and performance model driven optimization of pageview response time","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5366184/","accessionNumber":"11047512","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5366184/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connection and performance model driven optimization of pageview response time","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"73uhsubmitieee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084352S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5353818","isNumber":"5362673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353818","xplore-issue":"5362673","articleId":"5366184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5366202,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Kumar","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Sikkim, India"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086084928"},{"name":"Sucheta Sushan Ghose","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Sikkim, India"],"firstName":"Sucheta Sushan","lastName":"Ghose","id":"37667365100"},{"name":"M.

In this paper, we present a contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)-based method to remove fog.

First, the background image is extracted from the video sequence. And then the moving pixels are estimated and bounded into foreground images. Second, the foreground and background images are defogged respectively by CLAHE. Third, the foreground and background images are fused into the new frames. Finally, the defogged video sequence is obtained. We experiment with a video sequence degraded by fog to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.

However, its quick convergence often implies a rapid loss of diversity, which inevitably results in prematurity. Borrowed the idea of non-uniform mutation from evolutionary algorithm (EA) a non-uniform variance fuzzy guided PSO (fGuiPSO) is presented in this paper. The new particle updating strategy is based on the concept of fuzzy global best to deal with the premature convergence and diversity maintenance within the swarm. The variance of the global best determines its perturbing neighbor size and the non-uniform mutation operation has the merits of searching the space uniformly initially and very locally at later stage. Therefor the non-uniform idea is applied to adjust the variance of the global best particle. This non-uniform variance fuzzy guided particle updating scheme is also theoretically analyzed. Eight benchmarks are used to validate fGuiPSO and experiments indicate that fGuiPSO performs much better than PSO both in quality of solutions and robustness. The experiments confirm us that the non-uniform fuzzy particle updating strategy is a useful attempt for stochastic heuristic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.294","startPage":"341","endPage":"345","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362493/05366264.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-uniform Variance Fuzzy Guided Particle Swarm Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Convergence","Analysis of variance","Stochastic processes","Telecommunication computing","Mathematics","Evolutionary computation","Robustness","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","fuzzy set theory","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform variance fuzzy guided particle swarm algorithm","evolutionary algorithm","fuzzy global best","premature convergence","diversity maintenance","nonuniform mutation operation","space searching","nonuniform idea","nonuniform variance fuzzy guided particle updating scheme","stochastic heuristic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5366264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Non-uniform Variance Fuzzy Guided Particle Swarm Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5366264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034390","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-uniform Variance Fuzzy Guided Particle Swarm Algorithm","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736d341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.179533S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","xplore-issue":"5362493","articleId":"5366264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5366266,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Meng","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Meng","id":"37534744100"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37538190400"},{"name":"Xue-Li Wu","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Xue-Li","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407325100"},{"name":"Xuan Lv","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Lv","id":"37547934000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5366266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Cellular neural networks","Delay effects","Neural networks","Uncertainty","Asymptotic stability","Stability criteria","Lyapunov method","Equations","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","delays","Lyapunov methods","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","cellular neural networks","time-varying delay","global stability","Lyapunov stability theory","LMI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5366266","abstract":"In this paper, the global stability is investigated for cellular neural networks with time-varying delays and uncertainty.

Genetic algorithm is wildly used to solve Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem. This paper presents an improved genetic algorithm. The improved genetic algorithm we proposed uses many different strategies to get a better result. During the phase of create initial population, the improved genetic algorithm takes into account the number of operations in each job. And the intelligent mutation strategy is used which makes every individual and gene have different probability to mutate. In this paper, the object of scheduling algorithm is to get a sequence of the operations on machines to minimize the makespan.

Genetic algorithm (GA), as a general-purposed global optimization algorithm, has the disadvantages of the premature phenomenon and poor performance in local optimization. In the present paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which combines the conjugate gradient method (CGM) with GA, is proposed to improve the performance of GA for cable forces optimization in a CFST arch bridge. The advantages of GA in global optimization and CGM in local searching ability are both included in the HGA method. Numerical example indicates that the results based on the method may be used to the backward analysis of the initial state, and that the proposed HGA has excellent features of quick convergence rate and best global performance.","doi":"10.1109/CISE.2009.5366302","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software

The experimental results indicate that the optimization precision and the convergence speed of the proposed method are significantly improved when compared with those of original AFSA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2009.343","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362492/5362493/05366399.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"285","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2009.343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5366399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11034398","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5366399/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm","confLoc":"Tianjian, China","sourcePdf":"3736d281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053177S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5362492","isNumber":"5362493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5362492","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5362493","articleId":"5366399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5366400,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Lu","affiliation":["School of Hydropower and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Lu","id":"37644850500"},{"name":"Jianzhong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Hydropower and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianzhong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278268500"},{"name":"Yaoyao He","affiliation":["School of Hydropower and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yaoyao","lastName":"He","id":"37669758900"},{"name":"Ying Liu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering & Information Technology College, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Liu","id":"37675755900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4994-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-7379"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-7387"}],"articleNumber":"5366400","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5366400","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Simulated annealing","Particle swarm optimization","Support vector machines","Load modeling","Load forecasting","Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Statistical learning","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","particle swarm optimisation","regression analysis","simulated annealing","support vector machines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing theory","particle swarm optimization","support vector machine","load forecasting","statistical learning theory","nonlinear regression","time series problems","electric power system load"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5366400","pdfPath":"/iel5/5362513/5362514/05366400.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5366400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulated Annealing Theory Based Particle Swarm Optimization for Support Vector Machine Model in Short-Term Load Forecasting","abstract":"Support vector machine (SVM) is based on the statistical learning theory. It has recently been successfully used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems and has been applied to predict values. The key problem of SVM is the choice of SVM parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has the ability of global optimization. This paper proposed an improved PSO algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA) theory. The strong searching ability of SA was employed to PSO algorithm to avoid the premature convergence with better stability and astringency. The SA based PSO algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of SVM model. The study used the new model to forecast load of electric power system.

In this paper, a 2-DOF redundantly actuated parallel robot is taken as the object of study. Diagonal recurrent neural network (DRNN) is known for its dynamic mapping and fit for nonlinear dynamical systems.

The DRNN neural network makes up the deficiency of the conventional PID control, and strengthens the adaptivity of the whole system. The conventional PID controller is applied to compare with the proposed controller. The two controllers are used to track a straight line under the trapezoidal velocity planning.

This method does not depend on classifier. The main idea is: at first, a group of particles are generated randomly. The OIE between attribute set and class attribute is used as BPSO algorithm's fitness function, its size denotes the correlation degree between selected attribute set and class attribute. Then, feature subset is optimized by BPSO. Finally, feature subset, which has the largest OIE with class attribute, is selected as the optimal feature subset.

It firstly selects some large samples from a dynamic instruction stream as candidates of detail simulation and then samples some small groups from each selected first stage sample to do detail simulation. Since the distribution of standard deviation of cycle per instruction (CPI) is insensitive to microarchitecture, TSS could be used to speedup design space exploration by splitting the sampling process into two stages, which is able to remove redundant instruction samples from detail simulation when the program is in stable program phase (standard deviation of CPI is near zero). It also adopts systematic sampling to accelerate the functional warm-up in sampling simulation. Experimental results show that, by combining these two techniques, TSS achieves an average and maximum speedup of 1.3 and 2.29 over SMARTS, with the average CPI relative error is less than 3%. TSS could significantly accelerate the time consuming iterative early design evaluation process.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366603","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5353818/5362673/05366603.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TSS: Applying two-stage sampling in micro-architecture simulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"TSS: Applying two-stage sampling in micro-architecture simulations","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5366603/","accessionNumber":"11036120","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5366603/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TSS: Applying two-stage sampling in micro-architecture simulations","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"48submitieee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091399S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5353818","isNumber":"5362673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353818","xplore-issue":"5362673","articleId":"5366603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5366613,"authors":[{"name":"Liuge Du","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Liuge","lastName":"Du","id":"37395007700"},{"name":"Kang Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Li","id":"37403410600"},{"name":"Fanmin Kong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Fanmin","lastName":"Kong","id":"37400014700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5366613","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Computer graphics","Computer architecture","Difference equations","Concurrent computing","Application software","Differential equations","Maxwell equations","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","coprocessors","finite difference time-domain analysis","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time domain method","general purpose graphics processing units","computer unit device architecture","3D FDTD simulation","GT200 coprocessor"]}],"abstract":"Parallel Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method has been explored over past few years because of the expensive computation needed for its application.

Gradient-based learning procedures are easily implemented through semi-automatic differentiation of complex models constructed by assembling predefined modules. We introduce an open-source and cross-platform C++ library called EBLearn to enable the construction of energy-based learning models. EBLearn is composed of two major components, libidx: an efficient and flexible multi-dimensional tensor library, and libeblearn: an object-oriented library of trainable modules and learning algorithms.

It is presents a novel approaches that can improve image quality by reducing corrupted pixels, but leave good pixels unchanged. First, information measure method is introduced to extract noise features from observation image.

Compared to the traditional enterprise class hard disks, SSDs provide faster read performance, lower cooling cost, and higher power efficiency. However, write performance of a flash based SSD can be up to an order of magnitude slower than its read performance. Furthermore, frequent write operations degrade the lifetime of flash memory. A nonvolatile cache can greatly help to solve these problems. Although a RAM cache is relative high in cost, it has successfully eliminated the performance gap between fast CPU and slow magnetic disk. Similarly, a nonvolatile cache in an SSD can alleviate the disparity between the flash memory's read and write performance. A small write cache that reduces the number of flash block erase operations, can lead to substantial performance gain for write-intensive applications and can extend the overall lifetime of flash based SSDs. This paper presents a novel write caching algorithm, the Large Block CLOCK (LB-CLOCK) algorithm, which considers `recency' and `block space utilization' metrics to make cache management decisions. LB-CLOCK dynamically varies the priority between these two metrics to adapt to changes in workload characteristics. Our simulation based experimental results show that LB-CLOCK outperforms the best known existing flash caching algorithms for a wide range of workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5353818/5362673/05366737.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5362673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5366737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large Block CLOCK (LB-CLOCK): A write caching algorithm for solid state disks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Solid state circuits","Costs","Flash memory","Nonvolatile memory","Hard disks","Cooling","Degradation","Read-write memory","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","disc storage","flash memories","hard discs","NAND circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large block CLOCK","write caching algorithm","solid state disks","NAND flash memory","I-O intensive applications","nonvolatile cache","write-intensive applications","cache management decisions","block space utilization metrics","recency metrics","RAM cache"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5366737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Large Block CLOCK (LB-CLOCK): A write caching algorithm for solid state disks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5366737/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11036142","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Block CLOCK (LB-CLOCK): A write caching algorithm for solid state disks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"19submitieee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082486S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5353818","isNumber":"5362673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353818","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5362673","articleId":"5366737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5366748,"authors":[{"name":"Jiong Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and System, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407601100"},{"name":"Xiaoyong Lei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and System, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyong","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085419497"},{"name":"Shuling Dai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and System, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuling","lastName":"Dai","id":"37089123495"},{"name":"Na Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and System, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Chen","id":"37676948200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4507-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5366748","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5366748","abstract":"In distributed virtual environment many methods of data distribution management (DDM) are presented to efficiently improve network traffic situation and save system resources, these technologies are based on virtual environment partition.

Since temporal locality is dominant in page references of virtual memory, LRU and its approximated algorithms are widely used. However, we show that this is not true for write references. We analyze the characteristics of virtual memory read and write references separately, and find that the temporal locality of write references is weak and irregular. Based on this observation, we present a new page replacement algorithm that uses different strategies for read and write operations in predicting the re-reference likelihood of pages. For read operations, temporal locality alone is used, but for write operations, write frequency as well as temporal locality is used. The algorithm partitions the memory space into a read area and a write area to keep track of their reference patterns precisely, and then adjusts their sizes dynamically based on their reference patterns and I/O costs. Though the algorithm has no external parameter to tune, it performs better than CLOCK, CAR, and CFLRU by 20-66%. It also supports optimized implementations for virtual memory systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5366768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11047520","htmlLink":"/document/5366768/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing virtual memory write references for efficient page replacement in NAND flash memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing virtual memory write references for efficient page replacement in NAND flash memory","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"157submitieee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105139S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5353818","isNumber":"5362673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353818","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5362673","articleId":"5366768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5366838,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Jinhui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37678514800"},{"name":"Chengfang Tian","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Chengfang","lastName":"Tian","id":"37575483900"},{"name":"Wei Fang","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Fang","id":"37400404500"},{"name":"Nannan Zhang","affiliation":["Commercial Foreign Language Department, Hebei College of Finance, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Nannan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37670667600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5557-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3852-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5366838","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical technology","fuzzy neural nets","power engineering computing","thermal power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evaluation model","desulphurizer performance","fuzzy probabilistic neural network","microstructure","catalytic performance","relative membership degree","fuzzy mathematics","MATLAB simulation verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy mathematics","relative membership degree","probabilistic neural network","desulphurizer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5366838","abstract":"Based on combination of the microstructure and catalytic performance of desulphurizer, the paper proposes the evaluation model for desulphurizer performance based on Fuzzy Probabilistic Neural Network Model (FPNN) which combines the relative membership degree in fuzzy mathematics with Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN).

An improved CC framework is proposed, which designs a basic optimizer that has better performance in high-dimension optimization. The optimizer is a simplex-based genetic algorithm (HD-simplex GA) that is composed by a fusion of the multi-direction searches of the Nelder-Mead simplex method and the evolution mechanism of steady GA. Based on above points, a simplex-based cooperative co-evolution genetic algorithm (Simplex CCGA) is presented. Extensive computational studies had been made to evaluate the performance of simplex CCGA in several benchmark functions with up to 500-1500 dimension.

These signals can be considered as those received by a virtual array of MN elements. However, for many MIMO radar array geometries, multiple virtual array elements can exist at the same location. Therefore, an equivalent virtual array may consist of less than MN elements with some 'natural' weighting upon elements. Shading may be applied to the virtual array, incorporating the natural weights, to yield desired beampatterns. This paper investigates array shading for a range of MIMO radar array geometries. Robustness to element failure is also discussed.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.0401","publicationTitle":"2009 IET International Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IET International Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5353247/5367270/05367414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.0401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO arrays and array shading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5367414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5367414/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO arrays and array shading","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10665343","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO arrays and array shading","confLoc":"Guilin","sourcePdf":"20090401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058149S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2009","isNumber":"5367270","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353247","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5367414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5367434,"authors":[{"name":"Guolong Cui","affiliation":["School of Electric Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Guolong Cui"},{"name":"Lingjiang Kong","affiliation":["School of Electric Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Lingjiang Kong"},{"name":"Xiaobo Yang","affiliation":["School of Electric Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xiaobo Yang"},{"name":"Jianyu Yang","affiliation":["School of Electric Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jianyu Yang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-84919-010-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0537-9989"}],"articleNumber":"5367434","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"abstract":"This paper deals with the problem of detecting signal with MIMO radar in correlated Gaussian clutter with known covariance matrix.

Relevance feedback (RF) has been proven to be an effective method for integrating the user's knowledge into the retrieval process to eliminate the semantic gap between the high level semantic concept and the low level features of an image. In this paper we present a framework of content-based medical image retrieval with RF based on support vector machine (SVM). In the framework, we design two novel sampling methods, i.e., nearest positive margin sampling algorithm (NPMSA) and positive margin sampling algorithm (PMSA), which can select informative images to feedback to user; and we adopt 10-level soft label instead of 2-level hard label, which increases the annotation accuracy. The results of experiments on medical image database show that the proposed sampling methods, especially NPMSA one, both outperform SVMactive sampling method, and the soft SVM classifier based on the framework behaves better than SVMactive. The convergence speed of RF based on the proposed framework and the sampling methods is faster than that of SVMactive.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.196","startPage":"483","endPage":"488","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05367888.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft SVM and Novel Sampling Rule Based Relevance Feedback for Medical Image Retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Soft SVM and Novel Sampling Rule Based Relevance Feedback for Medical Image Retrieval","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5367888/","accessionNumber":"11051199","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5367888/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft SVM and Novel Sampling Rule Based Relevance Feedback for Medical Image Retrieval","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3896a483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064043S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367867","isNumber":"5367868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367867","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5367868","articleId":"5367888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5367938,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Ho Song","affiliation":["INBS (intelligent NanoBio System Co-Design Centre), School of Engineering and Energy, Faculty of Minerals and Energy, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Byoung-Ho","lastName":"Song","id":"37671657000"},{"name":"Jang-Jae Lee","affiliation":["INBS (intelligent NanoBio System Co-Design Centre), School of Engineering and Energy, Faculty of Minerals and Energy, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Jang-Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37676984000"},{"name":"Mike Lee","affiliation":["INBS (intelligent NanoBio System Co-Design Centre), School of Engineering and Energy, Faculty of Minerals and Energy, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Lee","id":"37676146100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5244-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5367938","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5367938","abstract":"Ubiquitous health (U-Health) system witch focuses on automated applications that can provide healthcare to human anywhere and anytime using wired and wireless mobile technologies is becoming increasingly important.

The algorithm has low computational complexity. By simulation experimentation on Macbeth color chart and real images, the algorithm is proved to be effective and produces better quality images with conventional color interpolation methods.

The classification performance largely relies on the accuracy of segmentation. Unfortunately, perfect precision and disambiguation of segmentation cannot be reached. In order to solve this problem, a novel Chinese text classification method using string kernel is presented. String kernel computes the similarity of a pair of documents by comparing common substrings they have. Experimental results show that our method greatly enhances the classification on small training data sets. Although the performance of traditional string kernel is comparable to that of BOW methods on larger data set, the dimension of feature space is so high that the calculation process is very time-consuming. Our proposed key characters string kernel technique solves the efficiency and effectiveness problems. Experiments on larger data set show that SVM with key characters string kernel can achieve superior performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368021/5368022/05368026.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grid","doi":"10.1109/SKG.2009.59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SKG.2009.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5368022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chinese Text Classification Using Key Characters String Kernel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text categorization","Kernel","Data mining","Frequency","Natural languages","Support vector machines","Databases","Learning systems","Training data","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","natural language processing","support vector machines","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chinese text classification","key characters string Kernel","SVM","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sting Kernel","text classification","Support Vector Machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Chinese Text Classification Using Key Characters String Kernel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5368026/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11049792","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chinese Text Classification Using Key Characters String Kernel","confLoc":"Zhuhai, China","sourcePdf":"3810a113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055215S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368021","isNumber":"5368022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368021","xplore-issue":"5368022","articleId":"5368026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5368076,"authors":[{"name":"Shouhua Yu","affiliation":["College of Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shouhua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37405529700"},{"name":"Jingying Ou","affiliation":["College of Public Management, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jingying","lastName":"Ou","id":"37391160300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3876-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1472"}],"articleNumber":"5368076","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Economic forecasting","Agricultural products","Neural networks","Demand forecasting","Fluctuations","Artificial neural networks","Production","Innovation management","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agricultural products","forecasting theory","neural nets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forecasting model","agricultural products prices","wholesale markets","combined BP neural network-time series model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["agricultural products wholesale prices","forecast","BP Neural Network Model","Time Series Model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368076","abstract":"By considering the characteristics of agricultural products prices such as great fluctuations, nonstationarity and nonlinearity, a BP neural network model was designed for forecasting and verified by real data from some agricultural products wholesale markets.

Past studies focus on designing algorithms to minimize imposed workload by a fixed set of update transactions while maintaining data freshness within validity intervals. In this paper we revisit this problem by investigating the cost of data freshness maintenance and online scheduling overhead in the presence of mode changes in real-time systems. We propose to apply periodic scheduling policies when the imposed update workload is low to maintain high data freshness. When the update workload becomes high, we propose to switch to more sophisticated algorithms to improve schedulability. In the latter case, not only each scheduling policy must be able to schedule the task set in the corresponding mode, temporal validity must also be maintained during the mode changes. To address this problem, two algorithms, named search-based switch (SBS) and adjustment-based switch (ABS) are proposed to search for the proper switch point online. SBS checks the temporal validity at the beginning time slot of each idle period while ABS further relaxes this restriction through schedule adjustment. Our experimental results demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of these two algorithms. Our results also show that scheduling switch according to the runtime processor workload can significantly outperform a single fixed scheduling policy in terms of data freshness while incurring only limited online switch overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Scheduling Switch for Maintaining Data Freshness in Flexible Real-Time Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 30th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2009.36","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 30th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368115/5368116/05368167.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2009.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5368116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Online Scheduling Switch for Maintaining Data Freshness in Flexible Real-Time Systems","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5368167/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11050776","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Scheduling Switch for Maintaining Data Freshness in Flexible Real-Time Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3875a115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081192S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368115","isNumber":"5368116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368115","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5368116","articleId":"5368167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5368168,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New york, Binghamton, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37532952200"},{"name":"Kyoung-Don Kang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New york, Binghamton, USA"],"firstName":"Kyoung-Don","lastName":"Kang","id":"37279668600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3875-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1052-8725"}],"articleNumber":"5368168","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Delay","Feedback control","Error correction","Testing","Traffic control","Feedforward systems","Adaptive control","Fluctuations","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","feedback","feedforward","real-time systems","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust real-time data service","dynamic workload","feedback control","statistical feed-forward approach","real-time data service delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368168","abstract":"Real-time data services are needed in data-intensive real-time applications such as e-commerce or traffic control. However, it is challenging to support real-time data services, if workloads dynamically change based on the market or traffic status. To enhance the quality of real-time data services even in the presence of dynamic workloads, feedback control theory has been applied. However, a major drawback of feedback control is that it only reacts to performance errors. To improve the robustness of real-time data services, we develop a statistical feed-forward approach that proactively adapts the incoming load, if necessary, to support the desired real-time data service delay. Further, we integrate it with a feedback controller to compensate potential prediction errors and adjust the system behavior in a reactive manner for timely data services. Performance evaluation results acquired in our real-time data service testbed show that our integrated approach considerably reduces the average delay and transient delay fluctuations, while improving throughput compared to the tested baselines including the feed-forward-only and feedback-only approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5368116","publicationTitle":"2009 30th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 30th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368115/5368116/05368168.pdf","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2009.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2009.22","startPage":"105","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Proactive and Reactive Approaches for Robust Real-Time Data Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368168/","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Proactive and Reactive Approaches for Robust Real-Time Data Services","htmlLink":"/document/5368168/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11050777","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Proactive and Reactive Approaches for Robust Real-Time Data Services","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3875a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104028S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368115","isNumber":"5368116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368115","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5368116","articleId":"5368168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5368169,"authors":[{"name":"Duhee Lee","affiliation":["School of CSE, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Duhee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599976600"},{"name":"Chang-gun Lee","affiliation":["School of CSE, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang-gun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280420900"},{"name":"Kanghee Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kanghee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37336591000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3875-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1052-8725"}],"articleNumber":"5368169","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic Framework for Soft Real-Time Program Executions on NAND Flash Memory in Multi-Tasking Embedded Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 30th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368115/5368116/05368169.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2009 30th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5368116","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2009.33","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Embedded system","Read-write memory","Random access memory","Time to market","Shadow mapping","Portable media players","Nonvolatile memory","Job shop scheduling","Cellular phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","flash memories","iterative methods","optimisation","random-access storage","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time program executions","nonvolatile NAND flash memory","multi-tasking embedded systems","mRT-PLRU","multi-tasking real-time constrained combination","stochastic-analysis-in-loop optimization","iterative convex optimization","probabilistic schedulability check"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time","NAND flash memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368169","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel technique called mRT-PLRU (multi-tasking real-time constrained combination of pinning and LRU), which forms a generic framework to use inexpensive nonvolatile NAND flash memory for storing and executing real-time programs in multi-tasking environments. In order to execute multiple real-time tasks stored in NAND flash memory with the minimal usage of expensive RAM, the mRT-PLRU is optimally configured in two steps. In the first step, the per-task analysis finds the function of RAM size vs. execution time for each individual task. Using these functions for all the tasks as inputs, the second-step called a stochastic-analysis-in-loop optimization conducts an iterative convex optimization with the stochastic-analysis for the probabilistic schedulability check. As a result, the optimization loop can optimally allocate RAM to multiple tasks such that their deadlines are probabilistically guaranteed with the minimal usage of RAM. Moreover, the mRT-PLRU is optimally configured in a developer-transparent way without giving any burden to the program developer, which is essential for the embedded system industry under a high pressure of time-to-market. The usefulness of the developed technique is intensively verified through both simulation and actual implementation. Our experimental study shows that mRT-PLRU can save up to 80% of RAM required by the industry-common shadowing approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11050778","htmlLink":"/document/5368169/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Generic Framework for Soft Real-Time Program Executions on NAND Flash Memory in Multi-Tasking Embedded Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Framework for Soft Real-Time Program Executions on NAND Flash Memory in Multi-Tasking Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3875a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085641S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368115","isNumber":"5368116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368115","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5368116","articleId":"5368169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5368189,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Seong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Dong Seong","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239544300"},{"name":"Fumio Machida","affiliation":["Service Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumio","lastName":"Machida","id":"37283174200"},{"name":"Kishor S.

Compare with the traditional methods of drawing and fitting of a polynomial, the method of BP neural network simulating can improve both the design precision and the working efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/WISM.2009.61","startPage":"261","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISM.2009.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367999","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367998/5367999/05368209.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulating and Design of the Irregular Cutting Edge with BP Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368209/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulating and Design of the Irregular Cutting Edge with BP Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5368209/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11049232","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulating and Design of the Irregular Cutting Edge with BP Neural Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3817a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03916S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367998","isNumber":"5367999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367998","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5367999","articleId":"5368209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5368265,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoping Su","affiliation":["School of information engineering, Hu Zhou Teachers College, Huzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoping","lastName":"Su","id":"37667986700"},{"name":"Ji Zhao","affiliation":["School Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37675808300"},{"name":"Jun Sun","affiliation":["School Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37281411900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3817-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5368265","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Genetic algorithms","Information systems","Educational institutions","Information technology","Differential equations","Acceleration","Organisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","genetic algorithms","identification","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online system identification","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithms","differential equations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["System Identification","QPSO"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WISM.2009.102","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367998/5367999/05368265.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISM.2009.102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online System Identification Based on Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, we explore the applicability of quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, an efficient variant of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, to online system identification problems.

The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides an advantage in the data throughput and blocking probability in case that high data rate traffics are heavily requested in the cell.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.327","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05368488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","startPage":"937","endPage":"942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Code Switching via an Optical Repeater for the Enhancement of User Capacity in WCDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Code Switching via an Optical Repeater for the Enhancement of User Capacity in WCDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368488/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11051314","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5368488/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Code Switching via an Optical Repeater for the Enhancement of User Capacity in WCDMA Systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3896a937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083251S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367867","isNumber":"5367868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367867","xplore-issue":"5367868","articleId":"5368488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5368489,"authors":[{"name":"Liming Wu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290618600"},{"name":"Junxiu Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Junxiu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405242100"},{"name":"Yuling Luo","affiliation":["Faculty of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuling","lastName":"Luo","id":"37671205100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5244-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5368489","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Design of Co-processor for the Image Processing Single Chip System","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05368489.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"946","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.26","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Image processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Filters","Hardware","Software architecture","Software design","Performance evaluation","Computer architecture","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","image processing","median filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessor design","image processing single chip system","hardware-software architecture","field programmable gate array","soft-core processor MicroBlaze core processor","external median filter coprocessor","bitonic sort","Xilinx Virtex-II Pro chip","embedded design kit","chip memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["embedded system","image processing","bitonic sort","parallel computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368489","abstract":"The performance of a hardware/software architecture designed to perform a wide range of fast image processing tasks is evaluated and presented in this paper.

A heuristic crossover and mutation operation have been proposed to prevent premature convergence. Presented operations try not only to solve this challenge by means of a heuristic function but also considerably accelerate the speed of convergence by reducing excessively the number of generations. By considering TSP's evaluation function, as a traveled route among all n cities, the probability of crossover and mutation have been adaptively and nonlinearly tuned. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed algorithm due to the heuristic performance is not easily getting stuck in local optima and has a reasonable convergent speed to reach the global optimal solution. Besides, implementation of the algorithm does not have any complexities.","doi":"10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.33","startPage":"112","endPage":"116","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368598/5368599/05368619.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5368599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Solve Traveling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm Based on Heuristic Crossover and Mutation Operator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traveling salesman problems","Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","Cities and towns","Biological cells","Pattern recognition","Acceleration","Cost function","Ant colony optimization","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traveling salesman problem","genetic algorithm","heuristic crossover","mutation operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Fitness Function","Heuristic Crossover","Mutation","Traveling Salesman Problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Solve Traveling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm Based on Heuristic Crossover and Mutation Operator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5368619/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11050932","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Solve Traveling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm Based on Heuristic Crossover and Mutation Operator","confLoc":"Malacca, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3879a112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049096S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368598","isNumber":"5368599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368598","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5368599","articleId":"5368619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5368620,"authors":[{"name":"Chu-Hsing Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chu-Hsing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291389600"},{"name":"Chen-Yu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Yu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406329300"},{"name":"Jung-Chun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Chun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292081000"},{"name":"Hao-Tian Zuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Tian","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37682077200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5330-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3879-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5368620","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Shortest path problem","Computer science","Genetic mutations","Evolution (biology)","Navigation","Graph theory","Roads","Biology computing","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","graph theory","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","shortest driving time problem","population size","mutation rate","crossover rate","converging rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["shortest path problem","genetic algorithm","shortest driving time","route guidance","approximate solutiont"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368620","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the influences on the genetic algorithm for the shortest driving time problem due to factors such as nodes on a map, the population size, the mutation rate, the crossover rate, and the converging rate.

Recently due to the vast improvement in machine learning and pattern recognition methods many computer scientists have applied these methods to solve this problem. However, protein folding problem is much more complicated than ordinary machine learning problems because of its natural complexity imposed by the high dimensionality of feature space and diversity of different protein fold classes. To deal with such a challenging problem, we use an ensemble classifier model by applying MLP and RBF Neural Networks and Bayesian ensemble method. Also we have used the Laplace estimation method in order to smooth confusion matrices of the base classifiers. Experimental results imply that RBF Neural Network holds better Correct Classification Rate (CCR) compared to other common classification methods such as MLP networks. Our experiments also show that the Bayesian fusion method can improve the correct classification rate of proteins up to 20% with the final CCR of 59% by reducing both bias and variance error of the RBF classifiers, on a benchmark dataset containing 27 SCOP folds.","doi":"10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.91","startPage":"436","endPage":"441","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5368599","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368598/5368599/05368628.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protein Fold Pattern Recognition Using Bayesian Ensemble of RBF Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368628/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Protein Fold Pattern Recognition Using Bayesian Ensemble of RBF Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5368628/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11050847","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protein Fold Pattern Recognition Using Bayesian Ensemble of RBF Neural Networks","confLoc":"Malacca, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3879a436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075633S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368598","isNumber":"5368599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368598","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5368599","articleId":"5368628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5368639,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Djerou","affiliation":["Department Computer Science, Med Khider University, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Djerou","id":"37681296700"},{"name":"Nacer Khelil","affiliation":["Department Mathematics, Med Khider University, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Nacer","lastName":"Khelil","id":"37684274400"},{"name":"Houssem Eddine Dehimi","affiliation":["Department Computer Science, Med Khider University, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Houssem Eddine","lastName":"Dehimi","id":"37681293500"},{"name":"Mohamed Batouche","affiliation":["Department Computer Science,CCIS, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Batouche","id":"37282512600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5330-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3879-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5368639","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Image segmentation","Computer science","Pixel","Iterative algorithms","Ant colony optimization","Entropy","Genetic algorithms","Pattern recognition","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic multilevel thresholding","binary particle swarm optimization","image segmentation","optimal thresholds","gray level thresholds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Thresholding","Binary Particle Swarm","Optimization","Image segmentation","Kapur's method","Otsu's method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368639","abstract":"In this paper an automatic multilevel thresholding approach, based on binary particle swarm optimization, is proposed.

In this paper, a piecewise quadratic function is used to show the fuel cost equation of each generation units, and the B-coefficient matrix is used to represent transmission losses. The feasibility of the proposed method to show the performance of this method to solve and manage a constraint problems is demonstrated in 4 power system test cases, consisting 3,6,15, and 40 generation units with neglected losses in two of the last cases. The obtained PSO results are compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Quadratic Programming (QP) base approaches.

To resolve the multi-objective dilemma when choosing one signal estimation for multiple receive-antenna-branches, the proposed scheme updates each quantum particle in a Pareto optimal way. Simulations and comparisons with the QPSO of linear combining strategy and the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367995/5367996/05368713.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"480","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","doi":"10.1109/ISCID.2009.265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2009.265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QPSO Based Multiuser Detection for Antenna-Diversity-Aided MC-CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Receiving antennas","Particle swarm optimization","Signal resolution","Estimation","Maximum likelihood detection","Fading","Active noise reduction","Computational intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","antenna-diversity","multicarrier code-division multiple-access","quantum particle swarm optimization","log-likelihood function","receive antennas","signal estimation","Pareto optimisation","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","multiuser detection","QPSO","Pareto optimality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A QPSO Based Multiuser Detection for Antenna-Diversity-Aided MC-CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5368713/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11037256","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QPSO Based Multiuser Detection for Antenna-Diversity-Aided MC-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"3865b477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065464S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367995","isNumber":"5367996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367995","xplore-issue":"5367996","articleId":"5368713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5368730,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37667989700"},{"name":"Sun Hailong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Hailong","id":"37393878200"},{"name":"Li Xiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37562607700"},{"name":"Zhou Chao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Chao","id":"37672100300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3865-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5368730","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"abstract":"Software production line and Web services are two new hot topics in the field of software engineering and distributed computing.

Comparing with traditional PSOs, the QPSO has better global-convergence and fewer parameters. Both PSO and QPSO were generally considered to have high requirement for the computing platform; hence, it is thought impractical to employ them into resource-constrained embedded real-time systems. However, with the development of FPGA technology, recently many complex algorithms were implemented in FPGA to get high computing performance for the embedded real-time applications. In this paper, a microarchitecture specific for QPSO suited to be implemented in a low-end FPGA is proposed.

In addition, a specific neurobiological network is also introduced and some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed criteria.","doi":"10.1109/ISCID.2009.51","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367995/5368739/05368847.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2009.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5368739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pinning Synchronization Control of Stochastic Neural Networks with Time Delays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Neural networks","Delay effects","Symmetric matrices","Communication system control","Asymptotic stability","Uncertainty","Image processing","Working environment noise","Neurotransmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","delays","neural nets","neurophysiology","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pinning synchronization control","stochastic neural networks","time delays","neurobiological network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pinning","synchronization","stochastic neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Pinning Synchronization Control of Stochastic Neural Networks with Time Delays","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5368847/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11048994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pinning Synchronization Control of Stochastic Neural Networks with Time Delays","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"3865a174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090813S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367995","isNumber":"5368739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367995","xplore-issue":"5368739","articleId":"5368847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5368848,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Zhang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37676775500"},{"name":"Gangsheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Education, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Gangsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37676175700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3865-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5368848","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multiuser detection","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Nonlinear equations","Noise measurement","Filtering algorithms","Nonlinear systems","Convergence","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","Kalman filters","multiuser detection","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint recursive channel estimation","multiuser detection method","flat fading CDMA systems","code-division multiple-access","state equation","multiplicative noise equation","nonlinear measurement equation","optimal filtering algorithm","engineering problems","fast convergence rate","low bit error rate","Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","multiuser detection","CDMA","extended Kalman filter","joint estimation"]}],"abstract":"For a flat fading code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system, by representing it as the appropriate system model consisting of state equation, multiplicative noise equation and the nonlinear measurement equation, an optimal filtering algorithm is used for joint recursive channel estimation and multiuser detection based on the established model.

Keyword search techniques on the Web cannot directly be applied to databases because the data on the Internet and database are in different forms. So keyword search systems in relational databases have recently proposed. However existing systems limit type of keywords to database value terms, and generally assumed that answers are in instance level. Thus, this research aims to propose an effective approach for free-form keyword searching in databases which allows users to search either with database value terms, metadata terms or user terms. The metadata model accommodates these terms as well as underlying database semantics. Moreover, we present a branch and bound algorithm used for finding the optimal answer graphs. Our preliminary experiment results confirm precision of our approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05368850.pdf","endPage":"658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Metadata Search Approach with Branch and Bound Algorithm to Keyword Query in Relational Databases","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.145","startPage":"653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Metadata Search Approach with Branch and Bound Algorithm to Keyword Query in Relational Databases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368850/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11051401","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5368850/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Metadata Search Approach with Branch and Bound Algorithm to Keyword Query in Relational Databases","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3896a653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060815S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367867","isNumber":"5367868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367867","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5367868","articleId":"5368850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5368859,"authors":[{"name":"Qi-yi Zhang","affiliation":["Transp.

For dealing with the problem that genetic algorithm are hardly applied to community detection, we propose a genetic algorithm with ensemble learning (GAEL) for detecting community structure in complex networks. GAEL replaces its traditional crossover operator with a multi-individual crossover operator based on ensemble learning. Therefore, GAEL can avoid the problems that are brought by traditional crossover operator which is only able to mix string blocks of different individuals, but not able to recombine clustering contexts of different individuals into new better ones. In addition, the local search strategy, which makes mutated node be placed into the community where most of its neighbors are, is used in mutation operator. At last, a Markov random walk based method is used to initialize population in this paper, and it can provide us a population of accurate and diverse clustering solutions. Those diverse and accurate individuals are suitable for ensemble learning based multi-individual crossover operator. The proposed GAEL is tested on both computer-generated and real-world networks, and compared with current representative algorithms for community detection in complex networks. Experimental results demonstrate that GAEL is highly effective at discovering community structure.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.189","startPage":"702","endPage":"707","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05368902.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm with Ensemble Learning for Detecting Community Structure in Complex Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Complex networks","Educational institutions","Computer science","Computer networks","Social network services","Information technology","Helium","Genetic mutations","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","pattern clustering","query formulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["community structure detection","complex networks","genetic algorithm with ensemble learning","multiindividual crossover operator","clustering contexts","local search strategy","diverse clustering solutions","Markov random walk"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["complex network","community structure","genetic algorithm","ensemble learning","local search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5368902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm with Ensemble Learning for Detecting Community Structure in Complex Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5368902/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11051357","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm with Ensemble Learning for Detecting Community Structure in Complex Networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3896a702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093835S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367867","isNumber":"5367868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367867","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5367868","articleId":"5368902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5368913,"authors":[{"name":"Jishun Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, China"],"firstName":"Jishun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37675304900"},{"name":"Hua Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Ji","id":"37669586300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3865-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5368913","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5368913","abstract":"This paper introduces the multiple sensing mechanism of online moisture test for grain and improved BP neural network, and gives hardware structure of moisture test system for grain centering on TMS320F2812.

Compared with traditional discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the DTCWT has nearly shift invariant and directionally selective in two and higher dimensions important properties, which are suitable for image denoising. The bandelet transform has offer an asymptotically optimal representation for geometric images, but it lacks translation invariant. Firstly, the DTCWT is employed to obtain subands, and then bandeletization is implemented in each subband. During finding the best geometrical flow and optimal quadtree segment, the cost term of Lagrangian is confirmed by Bayes estimator. At last, Bayes soft-threshold shrinkage denoising in bandelet transform domain is implemented. The experiments show that the proposed denoising method has better results than several DTCWT-based methods for image with rich directional features. The denoised images recovered by the proposed scheme are visually more appealing.","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2009.255","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367971/5367972/05369051.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2009.255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Image Denosing Scheme via Combining Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Bandelets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5369051/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Image Denosing Scheme via Combining Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Bandelets","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11051527","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5369051/","conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Image Denosing Scheme via Combining Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Bandelets","confLoc":"Nanchang, China","sourcePdf":"3859a509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101822S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367971","isNumber":"5367972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367971","xplore-issue":"5367972","articleId":"5369051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5369073,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Jun","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hubei University of Industrial, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Jun","id":"37682257400"},{"name":"Li Jian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Hubei University of Education, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jian","id":"37397004500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3859-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5369073","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Topology","Chromium","Information technology","Application software","Industrial electronics","Computer industry","Electronics industry","Computer science education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid differential evolution","particle swarm optimization","global optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential Evolution","Particle Swarm Optimization","Global Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369073","abstract":"A hybrid differential evolution (HDE) approach derived from both the differential evolution (DE) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed.

In the latter, instead of the whole population, each individual can only communicate with its neighbors, and each individual creates its trial vector based on the best individual found by its neighbors so far.

Clipping can be performed in two ways- one is to clip the complex envelopes of OFDM signal and the other is to clip the Inphase (I-signal) and Quadrature phase (Q-signal) independently. The detailed investigation concerning the PAPR reduction and Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of both the techniques is made. A novel approach based on clipping and amplification is introduced as a mean for reducing PAPR in OFDM signal. Our Proposed scheme combines the effect of clipping the peak signals and amplifying the signals that have low amplitude of OFDM signal, hence the name Clipping and Amplification method. The method is then simulated and detailed comparisons in terms of PAPR reduction with other methods are made. Comparison among different M-array modulation techniques is made to draw the conclusion for the best suited modulation technique for OFDM in terms of PAPR reduction. Finally, relations among PAPR, threshold of clipping, threshold of amplification and CCDF are established. Results show that our proposed approach gives better performance than clipping method at the expense of increased CCDF.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM): A Novel Approach Based on Clipping and Amplification","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.254","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05369132.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5369132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM): A Novel Approach Based on Clipping and Amplification","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5369132/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11037572","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM): A Novel Approach Based on Clipping and Amplification","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3896a921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078651S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367867","isNumber":"5367868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367867","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5367868","articleId":"5369132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5369160,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Aidi","affiliation":["College of Foreign Languages, Zhejiang Normal University, ZJNU, Jinhua, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Aidi","id":"37681408800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3859-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5369160","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369160","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information processing","Information technology","Educational institutions","Information analysis","Courseware","Animation","Videos","Auditory system","Geometry","Cognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","Internet","multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive overload","information processing","student learning","hypertext structure","auditory information","visual information","multimedia learning","incidental processing","representational holding","Web-based learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive overload","cognitive load","Web-based Learning","information processing","information technology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IITA.2009.278","endPage":"394","startPage":"391","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367971/5367972/05369160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2009.278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Overload and Its Countermeasures from the Angle of Information Processing","abstract":"The problems of cognitive overload have greatly influenced students' learning in multimedia and Web-based environment.

The problem could be considered as a multi-objective optimization problem, owing to that it requires all kinds of network performances be optimized at the same time and keeps the cost minimum, and has been proven to be a NP-hard problem by some researchers. There is no existing effective determinant algorithm that can solve it so far. In this paper, we introduce the Pareto optimization theory, Pareto ranking technique and the Pareto converging genetic algorithm based on them, and a PCGA based algorithm for solving bicriteria network topology design problems of local area network, is presented, considering the network average delay and network cost. We also adopt the Pru\u00bffer number to represent chromosomes in order to ensure the tree topology of LAN. Besides, traditional crossover approach is improved to speed up the algorithm and a new variant based halting criteria is proposed to enhance the stability of the GA results. Thought the comparison between our results and that of exhausted search, our algorithm turns out to be correct and effective, and compared with the classic NPGA, the proposed method can search faster and produce topologies closer to the real Pareto-front.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5369271/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11048951","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5369271/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Research of an Approach to Design Local Area Network Topology Based on Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Research of an Approach to Design Local Area Network Topology Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"3865a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049265S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367995","isNumber":"5368739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367995","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5368739","articleId":"5369271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5369290,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yan-Gao","affiliation":["College of Water Resource and Hydropower Institute, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yan-Gao","id":"38270551900"},{"name":"Ma Guangwen","affiliation":["College of Water Resource and Hydropower Institute, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Guangwen","id":"37637185100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3859-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5369290","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369290","abstract":"Accurate electricity price forecasting can provide crucial information for electricity market participants to make reasonable competing strategies.

In the study, support vector machine trained by genetic algorithm (GA-SVM) is adopted to forecast electricity price, in which GA is used to select parameters of SVM.

For UCT algorithm, Monte-Carlo simulations are performed with the guidance of UCB1 formula, which are averaged to evaluate a specified action. We observe that, as more simulations are performed, later ones usually lead to more accurate results, partly because the level of the search used in the later simulation is deeper and partly because more results are available to direct subsequent simulations. This paper presents a new method to improve the performance of UCT algorithm by increasing the feedback value of the later simulations. And the experimental results in the classical game Go show that our approach increases the performance of Monte-Carlo simulations significantly when exponential models are used.","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2009.331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367980","startPage":"125","endPage":"128","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367971/5367980/05369603.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2009.331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backpropagation Modification in Monte-Carlo Game Tree Search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Application software","Computational modeling","Telecommunication computing","Machine learning","Distributed computing","Financial advantage program","Information technology","Backpropagation algorithms","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","games of skill","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation modification","Monte Carlo game tree search","multi armed bandit problem","tree structured search space","classical game Go","exponential models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine learning","monte-carlo tree search","weight factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Backpropagation Modification in Monte-Carlo Game Tree Search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5369603/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5369603/","accessionNumber":"11051758","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backpropagation Modification in Monte-Carlo Game Tree Search","confLoc":"Nanchang, China","sourcePdf":"3859b125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046187S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367971","isNumber":"5367980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367971","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5367980","articleId":"5369603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5369634,"authors":[{"name":"Zhifeng Chen","affiliation":["Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404309100"},{"name":"Peide Qian","affiliation":["Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peide","lastName":"Qian","id":"37265206200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3859-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5369634","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":712},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intrusion detection","Feedforward neural networks","Particle swarm optimization","Artificial neural networks","Feeds","Degradation","Genetic algorithms","Intelligent networks","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","radial basis function networks","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO-RBF neural network","network intrusion detection","network security","radial basis function neural network","feedforward neural network","real-time pattern classification","particle swarm optimization algorithm","nonlinear programming problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369634","abstract":"Detecting all kinds of intrusions efficiently is significant to network security. Radial basis function (RBF) neural network is a kind of feed forward neural network, which is widely employed as a real-time pattern classification. In RBF neural network, the center of radial basis function, the variance of radial basis of function and the weight have to be chosen. If they are not appropriately chosen, the RBF neural network may degrade validity and accuracy of modeling. Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is a member of the wide category of swarm intelligence methods to solve non-linear programming problems. PSO has proved to be competitive with genetic algorithm (GA) in parameter optimization. So PSO is used to optimize the RBF neural network parameters in this work. Therefore, the novel combination method based on RBF neural network and PSO (PSO-RBFNN) is adapted to network intrusion detection. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the conventional RBF neural network.","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2009.154","startPage":"362","endPage":"364","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2009.154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367972","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367971/5367972/05369634.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of PSO-RBF Neural Network in Network Intrusion Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5369634/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of PSO-RBF Neural Network in Network Intrusion Detection","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5369634/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11051591","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of PSO-RBF Neural Network in Network Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"Nanchang, China","sourcePdf":"3859a362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045018S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367971","isNumber":"5367972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367971","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5367972","articleId":"5369634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5369834,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Jing","affiliation":["Management College, Changchun University, Changchun, China","College of Biology & Agriculture Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Jing","id":"37669751200"},{"name":"Zhang Dongjie","affiliation":["Food Science College, Heilongjiang August First Land Reclamation University, DaQing, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Dongjie","id":"37088273910"},{"name":"Ma Zhongsu","affiliation":["College of Biology & Agriculture Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Zhongsu","id":"37088274913"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3876-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1472"}],"articleNumber":"5369834","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369834","abstract":"This article has conducted the research to the food supply chain's security problem from the supply chain risk management perspective.

In order to generate initialization vectors and keys for such communication fast enough, a true random number generator (TRNG) with a high bit rate is needed. In this paper an FPGA implementation of a TRNG based on several equal length oscillator rings that achieves a high bit rate is analyzed by using spectral analysis. The design is examined by defining a MatLab model of the TRNG and by investigating the frequency spectrum at different locations in order to find the speed increasing potential of the TRNG. Experiments performed on an Altera Cyclone II FPGA have shown that a TRNG, whose parameters were optimized by means of such a model, achieves a bit rate of 300 Mbit/s. Experiments with repeated restarts from a known state have shown that the output of the TRNG contains true randomness and not only pseudo randomness.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.95","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05369959.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5369959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Speed of a True Random Number Generator in FPGA by Spectral Analysis","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11051433","htmlLink":"/document/5369959/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Speed of a True Random Number Generator in FPGA by Spectral Analysis","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3896b105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047922S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367867","isNumber":"5367868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367867","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5367868","articleId":"5369959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5369970,"authors":[{"name":"Young Min Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei Univeristy, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young Min","lastName":"Cho","id":"37403266100"},{"name":"Janghoon Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei Univeristy, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Janghoon","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406103400"},{"name":"Seung Gye Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei Univeristy, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Gye","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37405508300"},{"name":"Dae Wook Byun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei Univeristy, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dae Wook","lastName":"Byun","id":"38257462500"},{"name":"Dong Ku Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei Univeristy, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Ku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"},{"name":"Young-il Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-il","lastName":"Kim","id":"38256032400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5244-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5369970","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power control","Downlink","Throughput","Mobile computing","Power system relaying","Distributed computing","Power engineering computing","Information technology","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","mobile communication","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-TDD","distributed mobile relay power control scheme","downlink throughput enhancement","mobile relay station aided system","numerical simulation","cell throughput performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.16j","mobile relay station","distributed power control"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a distributed mobile relay power control (DMRPC) scheme for maximizing individual cell throughput is proposed for mobile relay station (MRS) aided system. In the system with DMRPC, the power levels of MRSs are controlled by individual cell without cell cooperation and signaling overhead, and the appropriate power levels of MRSs are selected to maximize the cell throughput of their individual serving cell. It is demonstrated by numerical simulation that DMRPC provides the better cell throughput performance than either the full power MRS aided system or conventional system without MRS does. Moreover, it is shown that the MRS aided system with DMRPC outperforms the full power MRS aided system in average cell edge throughput. Finally, it is also verified that MRS aided systems with DMRPC and the conventional system without MRS have almost identical average cell edge throughput performance, while full power MRS aided systems show worse performance in cell edge throughput performance than the system without MRS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM-TDD Based Distributed Mobile Relay Power Control Scheme for Downlink Throughput Enhancement","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2009.86","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367867/5367868/05369970.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2009.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5367868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5369970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5369970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"OFDM-TDD Based Distributed Mobile Relay Power Control Scheme for Downlink Throughput Enhancement","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5369970/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11037588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM-TDD Based Distributed Mobile Relay Power Control Scheme for Downlink Throughput Enhancement","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3896a897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040529S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367867","isNumber":"5367868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367867","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5367868","articleId":"5369970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5369981,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Jae Kwak","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Jae","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37281260500"},{"name":"Nah-Oak Song","affiliation":["Mobile Multimedia Platform Center, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nah-Oak","lastName":"Song","id":"37280973000"},{"name":"Bumsoo Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bumsoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37675225600"},{"name":"Demijan Klinc","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Demijan","lastName":"Klinc","id":"37392241700"},{"name":"Steven W.
