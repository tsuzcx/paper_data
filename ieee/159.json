Implementing the identification technique using a dedicated hardware could be very useful to achieve smart units. In this context, the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) offer an efficient technology to realize a pattern classification strategy. A speaker identification system can be implemented using many classification approaches, one of these, the vector quantization technique (VQ), which is considered one of the most powerful classification techniques. In this paper a vector quantization is implemented in an FPGA.

The design of an efficient online memory BIST with low hardware overhead was always a goal for BIST designers, however having a fault tolerant BIST and reliable BIST architecture is one important issue that if neglected can make the whole BIST architecture useless. This paper presents a design approach for an on-line BIST architecture with fault tolerant ability for the SRAM IP-cores, which also has a respectful fault tolerant and data safety reliability. Proposed design has a low hardware overhead in contrast with the previous ones. Proposed architecture can guarantee the on-line BIST at the presence of a fault in the spare registers, used to keep a copy of source data of the under test memory cell. The optimum number of extra registers has been calculated which can guarantee 99% correcting ability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1590079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1590079/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Fault Tolerant On-Line Bisted SRAM IP-Core","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fault Tolerant On-Line Bisted SRAM IP-Core","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"01590079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041628S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10600","isNumber":"33508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10600","xplore-issue":"33508","articleId":"1590079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1590080,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The major part of an AES design is designing substitute boxes (S-box). S-boxes in our design are implemented at a lower cost rather than the existing implementations.

The high spectral efficiency in spectrum reuse is achieved by exploiting both the temporal and spectral characteristics of the multi-path fading channels suitable for high data rate applications.

This problem poses many challenges like location of license plate from images taken in poor illumination and bad weather condition; plates that are partly obscured by dirt and images that have low contrast. This paper presents a new morphology based method for license plate extraction from car images. The algorithm uses morphological operations on the preprocessed, edge images of the vehicles. Characteristic features such as license plate width and height, character height and spacing are considered for defining structural elements for morphological operations. Connected component analysis is used to select the band containing license plate from the candidate segmented. The experimental results with a reasonably large set of car images are very encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2005.1590116","publicationTitle":"2005 Annual IEEE India Conference - Indicon","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Annual IEEE India Conference - Indicon","pdfPath":"/iel5/10601/33509/01590116.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2005.1590116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33509","startPage":"24","endPage":"27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Morphology Based Approach for Car License Plate Extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1590116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Morphology Based Approach for Car License Plate Extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1590116/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1590116/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Morphology Based Approach for Car License Plate Extraction","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"01590116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096627S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10601","isNumber":"33509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10601","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"33509","articleId":"1590116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1590150,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

In Selective Mapping (SLM) technique, input data is multiplied with different number of phase sequences prior to OFDM modulation. The OFDM sequence with lowest PAPR is selected and transmitted. In order to reconstruct the data at the receiver, phase sequence must be transmitted as side information, which leads to loss in data rate. In this paper new SLM technique is used for PAPR reduction of convolutionally coded OFDM signal. U numbers of different sequences are generated by inserting different bit labels at the beginning of the data. At the receiver side, the receiver dose not need any side information and the bit labels are discarded after decoding. Usage of convolutional coding will offer two advantages, significant PAPR reduction and astonishing bit error rate (BER) performance.

This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach for solving the contingency-constrained reactive power optimization problem. Voltage bus magnitude, transformer tap setting and reactive power generation of capacitor bank are the control variables. A binary-coded GA with tournament selection, two point crossover and bit-wise mutation is used to solve this complex optimization problem. In the proposed algorithm, some modifications are applied to the original GA in order to take into account the discrete nature of transformer tap setting and capacitor bank. The proposed approach has been evaluated with four different objective functions namely, loss minimization, voltage profile improvement, voltage stability enhancement and total cost minimization. Voltage stability level of the system is defined based on the L-index of load buses. The optimal locations of the VAR sources are also identified using the GA based algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been tested on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus test systems and successful results have been obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1590223/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1590223/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Genetic Algorithm Approach for Multi-Objective contingency constrained Reactive Power Planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Genetic Algorithm Approach for Multi-Objective contingency constrained Reactive Power Planning","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"01590223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06094S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10601","isNumber":"33509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10601","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33509","articleId":"1590223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1590224,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The working of DSTATCOM with self supported dc bus is used in two different modes; one is, unity power factor (UPF) mode and second is, zero voltage regulation (ZVR) mode. The heart of the control of DSTATCOM is the derivation of reference currents, which decide the switching of three legs of voltage source inverter (VSI) used in DSTATCOM. The NNRCE is used for control of DSTATCOM, which operates on LMS algorithm. The real positive sequence current component of current is extracted using NNRCE without any phase shift. A PI controller is used to regulate the voltage across the capacitor connected at the dc bus of the VSI. In the ac voltage regulation mode, second PI controller is used to maintain the constant voltage at PCC with variation of load. To reduce the rating of DSTATCOM, an ac capacitor bank of almost half rating of the VAR required is connected at the load end. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB environment for unity power factor operation and ac voltage regulation through leading power factor operation.

The proposed strategy improves the Power Density of the SRM by 11.7% using GA. Similarly using SA, the power density of the machine is increased by 26.94%. The proposed design, in comparison with standard design procedures, highlights improvement in performance with considerable reduction in size. Both the methods GA and SA maximize Flux linkage and Torque per unit rotor volume of the SRM. Even in very high power applications such as Aerospace applications, it is possible to achieve similar optimization using the proposed strategy.

Using a dispersive medium as standard single mode optical fiber (SSMF) both in-phase and quadrature components of the QAM signal are simultaneously downconverted to baseband. In addition, the architecture provides easily remote detection capabilities.

When multiple targets are closely spaced, the conventional approach (MHT/assignment) may not give satisfactory results, mainly due to the difficulty in deciding the number of targets. Recently, the first moment of the \"multi-target posterior density\", called the probability hypothesis density (PHD), has been proposed to address the multi-target tracking problem. Particle filtering techniques have been applied to implement the PHD based tracking. In this paper, we explain our interpretation of the PHD, and then investigate its performance on the problem of tracking unresolved targets from multiple sensors. In the set-up, there are two different radars, which monitor the targets, and the PHD is fed sequentially by these scans. In the scenario, we investigate 3 different levels of complexity in terms of measurement extraction methodologies of sensors when there are unresolved targets 1) Sensor model reports a measurement with variance /spl sigma//sub mono//sup 2/. (Sensor is not capable of sensing any abnormality in radar return). 2) Sensor model gives a single measurement with a larger variance /spl sigma//sub azi//sup 2//spl ges//spl sigma//sub mono//sup 2/ 3) Sensor model uses a multi-target measurement extractor. Unresolved targets create separate measurements with variance /spl sigma//sub mono//sup 2/. Simulation results for two-dimensional scenario are given to show the performance of the approach. Based on our simulation results, we also discuss difficulties the PHD algorithm seems to encounter, especially as is reflected in the target \"death\" event.","doi":"10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591848","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/10604/33512/01591848.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591848","publicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","startPage":"8 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probability hypothesis density filter for multitarget multisensor tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1591848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Probability hypothesis density filter for multitarget multisensor tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1591848/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1591848/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8873956","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability hypothesis density filter for multitarget multisensor tracking","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01591848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066334S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10604","isNumber":"33512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10604","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"33512","articleId":"1591848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1591857,"authors":[{"name":"X.R.

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is a recursion that propagates the posterior intensity function-a 1st-order moment-of the random set of multiple targets in time. Like the Bayesian single-target filter, the PHD recursion also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although sequential Monte Carlo implementations have demonstrated the potential of the PHD filter, so far no closed-form solutions have yet been developed. In this paper, an analytic solution to the PHD recursion is proposed for linear Gaussian target dynamics with Gaussian births. This result is analogous to the Kalman recursion in Bayesian single-target filtering.

In this paper, we discuss an implementation of a 9-camera D-WASS with non-contiguous views, and analyse the performance of the tracking and vision sub-systems both empirically and analytically. In this application, event-based change detection algorithms in image space, as well as data association and tracking algorithms in a consistent real world coordinate system are realised in a real-time environment where both physical and temporal constraints are taken into consideration. This system has been demonstrated to work satisfactorily under various operating conditions. In order to characterise the performance of the system, the vision and tracking components, as well as the dependence of the latter on the former from a systems viewpoint, are studied analytically. The results are compared with those obtained empirically from real ground-truthed data. Potential extensions and improvements to the current implementation are also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/10604/33513/01591973.pdf","startPage":"8 pp.","publicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","doi":"10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1591973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision system for decentralised wide area surveillance using multiple nodes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Surveillance","Performance analysis","Object detection","Event detection","Maintenance","Cameras","Detection algorithms","Change detection algorithms","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target tracking","sensor fusion","computer vision","surveillance","cameras","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision subsystem tracking","decentralised wide area surveillance","9-camera D-WASS","event-based change detection algorithm","data association","physical constaints","temporal constraints","multiple nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wide area surveillance","decentralised data fusion","tracking","event-based change detection","system performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1591973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Vision system for decentralised wide area surveillance using multiple nodes","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1591973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8884726","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision system for decentralised wide area surveillance using multiple nodes","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01591973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059521S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10604","isNumber":"33513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10604","xplore-issue":"33513","articleId":"1591973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1591999,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

In this paper, we consider nonlinear, non-Gaussian systems monitored by multiple sensors. Normal and faulty behaviors can be modeled as two hypotheses. Due to the communication constraints, it is assumed that sensors can only send binary data to the fusion center. Under the assumption of independent, identically distributed observations, we propose a distributed fault detection algorithm, including local detector design and decision fusion rule design, based on the state estimation by particle filtering. Experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm and its superiority over the conventional Kalman filter-based methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591999","publicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/10604/33513/01591999.pdf","startPage":"8 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed fault detection via particle filtering and decision fusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1591999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1591999/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed fault detection via particle filtering and decision fusion","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8873960","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1591999/","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed fault detection via particle filtering and decision fusion","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01591999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047452S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10604","isNumber":"33513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10604","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"33513","articleId":"1591999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1592000,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The post-processing steps include recursive trending which implicitly forces the prognostic trend to be confirmed before updated estimates are reported. Prognostic false positives and false negatives are introduced as innovative measures that help in assessing the performance of the approach.

Choosing the most suited sensor for the execution of a sensor function is based on sensor capabilities and function attributes. When these characteristics change rapidly, sensor allocation for sensor functions will shift. To increase performance of the entire sensor network, the total set of sensors should be scheduled in a single system. This paper puts forward and compares three new methods for scheduling prioritised tasks in sensor networks. The first is based on fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis. The other two use a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the set of schedules. The second scheduler uses this set to (re)train a neural network to be used online. The third approach is a novel online use of the GA. Tests showed that the novel online GA leads to a robust scheduling algorithm with high overall performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent sensors","Intelligent networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Sensor systems","Network synthesis","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Testing","Robustness","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","intelligent sensors","fuzzy logic","Lyapunov methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","genetic algorithms","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["situational awareness","intelligent task scheduling","sensor network","fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis","genetic algorithm","optimization","trained neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor Management","Task Scheduling","Command & Control","Online Genetic Algorithms","fuzzy Lyapunov"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIF.2005.1592013","publicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/10604/33513/01592013.pdf","startPage":"8 pp.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIF.2005.1592013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent task scheduling in sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1592013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent task scheduling in sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592013/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1592013/","accessionNumber":"8873954","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent task scheduling in sensor networks","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01592013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057189S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10604","isNumber":"33513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10604","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33513","articleId":"1592013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1592096,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is more complicated under the grid computing environment. In this paper, we consider the problem of allocating independent, heterogeneous tasks on grid environment. A heuristic task scheduling strategy which is composed of two algorithms satisfied with resource load balance is presented. The WMTG-min heuristic algorithm schedules tasks by employing the weighted mean execution time, which reflects the performance of overall machines, and it is a high efficient algorithm. The further optimal scheduling result of the above algorithm is gained by the WMTSG-min algorithm which employs the weighted mean execution time and sufferage value as heuristic information. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via extensive simulation experiments. Experiment results show that the heuristic strategy performs significantly to ensure high throughput. Furthermore, results show that although it may not be polynomial, the WMTSG-min algorithm is efficient","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on High-Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region (HPCASIA'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10608/33517/01592326.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on High-Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region (HPCASIA'05)","doi":"10.1109/HPCASIA.2005.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCASIA.2005.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1592326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic scheduling strategy for independent tasks on grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Throughput","Grid computing","Heuristic algorithms","Resource management","Distributed computing","Computer science","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","grid computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic scheduling","grid computing","task scheduling","NP-complete problem","parallel computing","distributed computing","resource load balance","WMTG-min heuristic algorithm","weighted mean execution time","optimal scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-1 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic scheduling strategy for independent tasks on grid","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1592326/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8970118","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic scheduling strategy for independent tasks on grid","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01592326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070557S","chronDate":"1-1 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10608","isNumber":"33517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10608","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33517","articleId":"1592326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1592483,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Nuno-Maganda","affiliation":["Optics and Electronics, National Institute for Astrophysics Optics and Electronics, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Nuno-Maganda","id":"38277291100"},{"name":"M.O.

The processor presents a hybrid structure both synchronous and self-timed. Where the neuronal network blocks (SOM) are synchronized with a protocol of 4 phases, for the control of data flow. The neuroprocessor was designed for the analysis and classification of tension deformation patterns of the knee ligaments.

However, implementations of BWT-based algorithms have been limited due to the complexity of the suffix sorting process applied to the input string. Proposed solutions involve data structures combined with hardware architectures aimed at reducing computational complexity. However, advanced data structures are difficult to be implemented directly into hardware architectures as they require sophisticated control units. In this paper we present a novel architecture based on a parallel sorting block to implement the BWT transform. The proposed architecture has been implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device providing good performance improvements compared with other reported implementations on FPGAs. Results obtained show a reduction in the number of cycles and an increase in the maximum frequency compared with other works. FPGA implementation results are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/RECONFIG.2005.9","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10611/33520/01592499.pdf","startPage":"7 pp.","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RECONFIG.2005.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based parallel sorting architecture for the Burrows Wheeler transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1592499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592499/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based parallel sorting architecture for the Burrows Wheeler transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8978772","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1592499/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based parallel sorting architecture for the Burrows Wheeler transform","confLoc":"Puebla, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01592499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072684S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10611","isNumber":"33520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10611","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"33520","articleId":"1592499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592503,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Effectiveness and results are presented, robustness is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/SADFE.2005.8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SADFE.2005.8","startPage":"264","endPage":"278","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Workshop on Systematic Approaches to Digital Forensic Engineering (SADFE'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10612/33521/01592538.pdf","publicationTitle":"First International Workshop on Systematic Approaches to Digital Forensic Engineering (SADFE'05)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting digital tampering by blur estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Detecting digital tampering by blur estimation","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1592538/","accessionNumber":"8749642","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592538/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting digital tampering by blur estimation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"01592538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040614S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10612","isNumber":"33521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10612","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"33521","articleId":"1592538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1592556,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Zhuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ling Zhuo","id":"37281877500"},{"name":"V.K.

However, due to the pipelining in the FPGA-based floating-point units, data hazards may occur during reduction of series of values. A typical example of reduction is the accumulation of sets of floating-point values, which is needed in many scientific operations such as dot product and matrix-vector multiplication. Reduction circuits can significantly impact the overall performance, impose unrealistic buffer requirements, or occupy large area on the FPGA. In this paper, we introduce a high-performance and area-efficient FPGA-based reduction circuit. It can reduce multiple sets of sequentially delivered floating-point values without stalling the pipeline. In contrast with previous works, the proposed circuit uses one floating-point adder, and can handle input sets of arbitrary size. The buffer size needed by the circuit is independent of the size of the individual sets and the number of input sets. Using a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA as the target device, we implement the proposed reduction circuit and present performance and area results.","doi":"10.1109/CAHPC.2005.28","publicationTitle":"17th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing (SBAC-PAD'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"17th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing (SBAC-PAD'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10613/33522/01592556.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAHPC.2005.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1592556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance and area-efficient reduction circuits on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592556/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance and area-efficient reduction circuits on FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1592556/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8814643","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance and area-efficient reduction circuits on FPGAs","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01592556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066414S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10613","isNumber":"33522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10613","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33522","articleId":"1592556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592593,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The Data-IntensiVe Architecture (DIVA) system combines PIM memories with one or more external host processors and a PIM-to-PIM interconnect. DIVA increases memory bandwidth through two mechanisms: (1) performing selected computation in memory, reducing the quantity of data transferred across the processor-memory interface; and (2) providing communication mechanisms called parcels for moving both data and computation throughout memory, further bypassing the processor-memory bus. DIVA uniquely supports acceleration of important irregular applications, including sparse-matrix and pointer-based computations. In this paper, we focus on several aspects of DIVA designed to effectively support such computations at very high performance levels: (1) the memory model and parcel definitions; (2) the PIM-to-PIM interconnect; and, (3) requirements for the processor-to-memory interface. We demonstrate the potential of PIM-based architectures in accelerating the performance of three irregular computations, sparse conjugate gradient, a natural-join database operation and an object-oriented database query.","doi":"10.1109/SC.1999.10019","publicationTitle":"SC '99: Proceedings of the 1999 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '99: Proceedings of the 1999 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10615/33524/01592700.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.1999.10019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping Irregular Applications to DIVA, a PIM-based Data-Intensive Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mapping Irregular Applications to DIVA, a PIM-based Data-Intensive Architecture","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592700/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 Nov. 1999","conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping Irregular Applications to DIVA, a PIM-based Data-Intensive Architecture","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01592700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05391S","chronDate":"13-18 Nov. 1999","isNumber":"33524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10615","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1592700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592742,"authors":[{"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kwan-Liu Ma","id":"37275869400"},{"name":"D.M.

We present new algorithms and cost models for selecting tiling shapes and array pads. We explain why tiling is rarely needed for 2D PDE solvers, but can be helpful for 3D stencil codes. Experimental results show tiling 3D codes can reduce miss rates and achieve performance improvements of 17-121% for key scientific kernels, including a 27% average improvement for the key computational loop nest in the SPEC/NAS benchmark MGRID.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '00: Proceedings of the 2000 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10616/33525/01592745.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"SC '00: Proceedings of the 2000 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2000.10015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2000.10015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1592745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tiling Optimizations for 3D Scientific Computations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Program processors","Kernel","Partial differential equations","Microprocessors","Computer science","Educational institutions","Optimizing compilers","Tiles","Costs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-10 Nov. 2000","displayDocTitle":"Tiling Optimizations for 3D Scientific Computations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","conferenceDate":"4-10 Nov. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tiling Optimizations for 3D Scientific Computations","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01592745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045314S","chronDate":"04-10 Nov. 2000","isNumber":"33525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10616","citationCount":"95","articleId":"1592745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592757,"authors":[{"name":"D.

To achieve performance on the Grid, such applications must be scheduled so that shared data files are strategically placed to maximize reuse, and so that the application execution can adapt to the deliverable performance potential of target heterogeneous, distributed and shared resources. Parameter sweep applications are an important class of applications and would greatly benefit from the development of Grid middleware that embeds a scheduler for performance and targets Grid resources transparently. In this paper we describe a user-level Grid middleware project, the AppLeS Parameter Sweep Template (APST), that uses application-level scheduling techniques [1] and various Grid technologies to allow the efficient deployment of parameter sweep applications over the Grid. We discuss several possible scheduling algorithms and detail our software design. We then describe our current implementation of APST using systems like Globus [2], NetSolve [3] and the Network Weather Service [4], and present experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2000.10061","startPage":"60","publicationTitle":"SC '00: Proceedings of the 2000 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '00: Proceedings of the 2000 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10616/33525/01592773.pdf","endPage":"60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2000.10061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"4-10 Nov. 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-10 Nov. 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592773/","displayDocTitle":"The AppLeS Parameter Sweep Template: User-Level Middleware for the Grid","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The AppLeS Parameter Sweep Template: User-Level Middleware for the Grid","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01592773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080854S","chronDate":"04-10 Nov. 2000","isNumber":"33525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10616","citationCount":"113","articleId":"1592773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592790,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

Gauss-Seidel is not used to our knowledge on distributed memory machines as it is not obvious how to parallelize it effectively. We, among others, have found that Krylov solvers preconditioned with Jacobi, block Jacobi or overlapped Schwarz are effective on unstructured problems. Gauss-Seidel does however have some attractive properties, namely: fast convergence, no global communication (ie, no dot products) and fewer .ops per iteration as one can incorporate an initial guess naturally. This paper discusses an algorithm for parallelizing Gauss-Seidel for distributed memory computers for use as a multigrid smoother and compares its performance with preconditioned conjugate gradients on unstructured linear elasticity problems with up to 76 million degrees of freedom.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","Gaussian processes","Jacobian matrices","Character generation","Concurrent computing","Computational modeling","Damping","Convergence","Elasticity","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unstructured multigrid","algebraic multigrid","parallel graph algorithms","parallel Gauss-Seidel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unstructured multigrid","algebraic multigrid","parallel graph algorithms","parallel Gauss-Seidel"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/582034.582038","startPage":"14","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"SC '01: Proceedings of the 2001 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '01: Proceedings of the 2001 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10617/33526/01592790.pdf","doi":"10.1145/582034.582038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Memory Unstructured Gauss-Seidel Algorithm for Multigrid Smoothers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Memory Unstructured Gauss-Seidel Algorithm for Multigrid Smoothers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2001","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1592790/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Memory Unstructured Gauss-Seidel Algorithm for Multigrid Smoothers","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"01592790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087379S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2001","xplore-pub-id":"10617","isNumber":"33526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10617","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33526","articleId":"1592790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1592857,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The automated tuning system is able to tune the application parameers to within a few percent of the best value after evaluating only 11 out of over 1,700 possible configurations.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2002.10062","publicationTitle":"SC '02: Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","startPage":"44","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2002.10062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33527","pdfPath":"/iel5/10618/33527/01592880.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '02: Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application software","Software libraries","Grid computing","Specification languages","Computational modeling","Runtime library","Computerized monitoring","Automatic control","Control systems","Computer science"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Active Harmony: Towards Automated Performance Tuning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592880/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1592880/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"2002","conferenceDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Harmony: Towards Automated Performance Tuning","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"01592880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041239S","chronDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"10618","isNumber":"33527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10618","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"33527","articleId":"1592880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":1592883,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Conventional mass storage systems use either high performance RAID clusters, automated tape libraries or a combination of tape and disk. In this paper, we analyze an alternative design using massive arrays of idle disks, or MAID. We argue that this storage organization provides storage densities matching or exceeding those of tape libraries with performance similar to disk arrays. Moreover, we show that with effective power management of individual drives, this performance can be achieved using a very small power budget. In particular, we show that our power management strategy can result in the performance comparable to an always-on RAID system while using 1/15th the power of such a RAID system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","publicationDate":"2002","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1592883/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Massive Arrays of Idle Disks For Storage Archives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive Arrays of Idle Disks For Storage Archives","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"01592883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101209S","chronDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"10618","isNumber":"33527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10618","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"33527","articleId":"1592883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Non IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592884,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

Parallel systems based on this new technology are expected to provide higher scalability, adaptability, robustness, fault tolerance and lower power consumption than current MPPs or commodity clusters. In this paper we describe the design of Gilgamesh a PIM-based massively parallel architecture, and elements of its execution model. Gilgamesh extends existing PIM capabilities by incorporating advanced mechanisms for virtualizing tasks and data and providing adaptive resource management for load balancing and latency tolerance. The Gilgamesh execution model is based on macroservers a middleware layer which supports object-based runtime management of data and threads allowing explicit and dynamic control of locality and load balancing. The paper concludes with a discussion of related research activities and an outlook to future work.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2002.10061","publicationTitle":"SC '02: Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '02: Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10618/33527/01592884.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2002.10061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gilgamesh: A Multithreaded Processor-In-Memory Architecture for Petaflops Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1592884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592884/","displayDocTitle":"Gilgamesh: A Multithreaded Processor-In-Memory Architecture for Petaflops Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1592884/","conferenceDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gilgamesh: A Multithreaded Processor-In-Memory Architecture for Petaflops Computing","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"01592884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072931S","chronDate":"16-22 Nov. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"10618","isNumber":"33527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10618","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"33527","articleId":"1592884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592896,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

The system generalizes load balancing and server provisioning. It balances file metadata workload by moving file sets among cluster server nodes. It also responds to changing server resources that arise from failure and recovery and dynamically adding or removing servers. The system is adaptive and self-managing. It operates without any a-priori knowledge of workload properties or the capabilities of the servers. Rather, it continuously tunes load placement using a technique called adaptive, non-uniform (ANU) randomization. ANU randomization realizes the scalability and metadata reduction benefits of hash-based, randomized placement techniques. It also avoids hashing's drawbacks: load skew, inability to cope with heterogeneity, and lack of tunability. Simulation results show that our load-management algorithm performs comparably to a prescient algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2003.10045","publicationTitle":"SC '03: Proceedings of the 2003 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '03: Proceedings of the 2003 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10619/33528/01592910.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2003.10045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling Heterogeneity in Shared-Disk File Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","displayDocTitle":"Handling Heterogeneity in Shared-Disk File Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2003","htmlLink":"/document/1592910/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling Heterogeneity in Shared-Disk File Systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"01592910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108369S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10619","isNumber":"33528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10619","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33528","articleId":"1592910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1592938,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

Organizing the computation into streams and exploiting the resulting locality using a register hierarchy enables a stream architecture to reduce the memory bandwidth required by representative applications by an order of magnitude or more. Hence a processing node with a fixed bandwidth (expensive) can support an order of magnitude more arithmetic units (inexpensive). This in turn allows a given level of performance to be achieved with fewer nodes (a 1-PFLOPS machine, for example, with just 8,192 nodes) resulting in greater reliability, and simpler system management. We sketch the design of Merrimac, a streaming scientific computer that can be scaled from a $20K 2 TFLOPS workstation to a $20M 2 PFLOPS supercomputer and present the results of some initial application experiments on this architecture.","doi":"10.1145/1048935.1050187","publicationTitle":"SC '03: Proceedings of the 2003 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '03: Proceedings of the 2003 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10619/33528/01592938.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1048935.1050187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Merrimac: Supercomputing with Streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","displayDocTitle":"Merrimac: Supercomputing with Streams","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1592938/","publicationDate":"2003","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Merrimac: Supercomputing with Streams","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"01592938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056722S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10619","isNumber":"33528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10619","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"33528","articleId":"1592938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592946,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

To improve availability and manageability, we investigate and compare data location schemes for a large self-organizing storage cluster that can quickly adapt to the additions or departures of storage nodes. We further present an efficient location scheme that differentiates between small and large file blocks for reduced management overhead compared to uniform strategies. In our protocol, small blocks, which are typically in large quantities, are placed through consistent hashing. Large blocks, much fewer in practice, are placed through a usage-based policy, and their locations are tracked by Bloom filters. The proposed scheme results in improved storage utilization even with non-uniform cluster nodes. To achieve high scalability and fault resilience, this protocol is fully distributed, relies only on soft states, and supports data replication. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this protocol through trace-driven simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1592956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","publicationDate":"2003","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1592956/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Data Location Protocol for Self.organizing Storage Clusters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Data Location Protocol for Self.organizing Storage Clusters","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"01592956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10574S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10619","isNumber":"33528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10619","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33528","articleId":"1592956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1592958,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In response to increasingly severe threats from military targets with reduced radar cross sections (RCSs), slow-moving and low-flying aircraft hidden in foliage, and in environments with large numbers of targets, knowledge-based (KB) signal and data processing techniques offer the promise of significantly improved performance of all radar systems. Radars under KB control can be deployed to utilize valuable resources such as airspace or runways more effectively and to aid human operators in carrying out their missions. As battlefield scenarios become more complex with increasing numbers of sensors and weapon systems, the challenge will be to use already available information effectively to enhance radar performance, including positioning, waveform selection, and modes of operation. KB processing fills this need and helps meet the challenge.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/33529/01593334.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"29","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2006.1593334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2006.1593334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-based radar signal and data processing: a tutorial review","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar signal processing","Signal processing","Data processing","Radar detection","Radar cross section","Military aircraft","Radar antennas","Doppler radar","Airborne radar","Radar applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge based systems","radar signal processing","radar computing","military computing","military radar","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge-based radar signal","data processing","military operations","battlefield scenarios","weapon systems","positioning","waveform selection","receiver portion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-based radar signal and data processing: a tutorial review","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593334/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8945286","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-based radar signal and data processing: a tutorial review","sourcePdf":"01593334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075432S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"33529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"33529","articleId":"1593334","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1593335,"authors":[{"name":"S.

All three of these ingredients feature in the echo-location system of a bat, which may be viewed as a physical realization (albeit in neurobiological terms) of cognitive radar. Radar is a remote-sensing system that is widely used for surveillance, tracking, and imaging applications, for both civilian and military needs.

The DARPA KA sensor signal processing and expert reasoning (KASSPER) program has as its goal the demonstration of a high performance embedded computing (HPEC) architecture capable of integrating high-fidelity environmental knowledge (i.e., priors) into the most computationally demanding subsystem of a modern radar: the adaptive space-time beamformer. This is no mean feat as environmental knowledge is a memory quantity that is inherently difficult (if not impossible) to access at the rates required to meet radar front-end throughput requirements.

The topic is treated from both intuitive and theoretical aspects. A key requirement of STAP is knowledge of the spectral characteristics underlying the interference scenario of interest. Additional issues of importance in STAP include the computational cost of the adaptive algorithm as well as the ability to maintain a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) over widely varying interference statistics. This article addresses these topics, developing the need for a knowledge-based (KB) perspective. The focus here is on signal processing for radar systems using multiple antenna elements that coherently process multiple pulses. An adaptive array of spatially distributed sensors, which processes multiple temporal snapshots, overcomes the directivity and resolution limitations of a single sensor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/33529/01593337.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"65","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2006.1593337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2006.1593337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time adaptive processing: a knowledge-based perspective for airborne radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Airborne radar","Sensor arrays","Interference","Radar signal processing","Radar antennas","Spaceborne radar","Art","Computational efficiency","Adaptive algorithm","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time adaptive processing","radar signal processing","airborne radar","radar interference","knowledge based systems","radar computing","radar antennas","adaptive antenna arrays","distributed sensors","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time adaptive processing","knowledge-based perspective","airborne radar","STAP","interference","spectral characteristics","constant false alarm rate","multiple antenna elements","adaptive array","spatially distributed sensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Space-time adaptive processing: a knowledge-based perspective for airborne radar","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593337/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8945289","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time adaptive processing: a knowledge-based perspective for airborne radar","sourcePdf":"01593337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093443S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"33529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"33529","articleId":"1593337","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1593341,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Hao Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Miami University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Chi-Hao Cheng is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Miami University.

Many popular optical devices could be represented with a digital filter model as described in this article. Use of well-developed signal processing techniques and algorithms to design these optical devices is a wise use of existing technology. The wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) system, which is the dominating optical communication system, is introduced in this article. Three signal processing application examples for optical communications are presented: optical wavelength interleaver, an all-pass filter for chromatic dispersion compensation, and an electronic equalizer. As demonstrated in this article, signal processing could play an important role in the development of advanced optical communication systems. However, as demonstrated in the case of an electronic equalizer, some optical system characteristics may require special attention if signal processing techniques are to be applied successfully. Therefore, interdisciplinary cooperation between researchers in optics and signal processing will be crucial for optical communications to fully benefit from signal processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593341/","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593341/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8945292","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Signal processing for optical communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal processing for optical communication","sourcePdf":"01593341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065102S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"33529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33529","articleId":"1593341","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593365,"authors":[{"name":"L.S.J.

In the proposed DDFS architecture the ROM stores a few of the sinusoidal values, and the interpolation points between the successive stored values are calculated using linear arid nonlinear addressing schemes. The nonlinear addressing scheme is used to adaptively vary the number of interpolation points as the slope of the sinusoid changes, leading to a greatly reduced ROM size. The proposed architecture achieves a high compression ratio with a spurious response comparable to that of recent ROM compression techniques. To validate the proposed DDS architecture, the linear, nonlinear, and conventional DDS ROM architectures were implemented in a Xilinx Spartan II FPGA and their spurious performances were compared.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Read only memory","Quantization","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency synthesizers","Table lookup","Clocks","Interpolation","Phase noise","Piecewise linear techniques","Linear approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["read-only storage","direct digital synthesis","piecewise linear techniques","interpolation","quantisation (signal)","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DDS","nonlinear ROM addressing scheme","compression ratio","quantization noise","direct digital frequency synthesis","piecewise linear technique","interpolation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593365","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593365","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33532/01593365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593365","startPage":"274","endPage":"283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel DDS using nonlinear ROM addressing with improved compression ratio and quantization noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel DDS using nonlinear ROM addressing with improved compression ratio and quantization noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593365/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1593365/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8797942","pubMedId":"16529101","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel DDS using nonlinear ROM addressing with improved compression ratio and quantization noise","sourcePdf":"01593365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061857S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"33532","articleId":"1593365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593368,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

A computer is used as the interface for image display. The beamformer that applies delays to the echoes for each channel is implemented with the strategy of combining the coarse and fine delays. The coarse delays that are integer multiples of the clock periods are achieved by using a first-in-first-out (FIFO) structure, and the fine delays are obtained with a fractional delay (FD) filter. Using this principle, dynamic receiving focusing is achieved. The image from a wire phantom obtained with the imaging system was compared to that from a prototype ultrasonic backscatter microscope with a 45 MHz single-element transducer. The improved lateral resolution and depth of field from the wire phantom image were observed. Images from an excised rabbit eye sample also were obtained, and fine anatomical structures were discerned.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593369","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33532/01593369.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"309","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-frequency ultrasound annular array imaging.

The system can handle up to 64-element linear array transducers and excite 16 channels and receive simultaneously at 100 MHz sampling frequency with 8-bit precision. Radio frequency (RF) signals are digitized, delayed, and summed through a real-time digital beamformer, which is implanted using a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Using fractional delay filters, fine delays as small as 2 ns can be implemented. A frame rate of 30 frames per second is achieved. Wire phantom (20 /spl mu/m tungsten) images were obtained and -6 dB axial and lateral widths were measured. The results showed that, using a 30 MHz, 48-element array with a pitch of 100 /spl mu/m produced a -6 dB width of 68 /spl mu/m in the axial and 370 /spl mu/m in the lateral direction at 6.4 mm range.

In this paper both SH-SAW and SH-BAW generated by finite-length, interdigital transducers (IDTs) on langasite, Euler angles (0/spl deg/, 22/spl deg/, 90/spl deg/), are simulated using combined finite- and boundary-element methods (FEM/BEM). Aluminum and gold IDT electrodes ranging in thickness from 600 /spl Aring/ to 2000 /spl Aring/ have been simulated, fabricated, and tested, with both free and metalized surfaces outside the IDT regions considered. Around the device's operating frequency, the percent difference between the calculated IDT impedance magnitude using the FEM/BEM model and the measurements is better than 5% for the different metal layers arid thicknesses considered. The proportioning of SH-SAW and SH-BAW power is analyzed as a function of the number of IDT electrodes; type of electrode metal; and relative thickness of the electrode film, h//spl lambda/, where /spl lambda/ is the SH-SAW wavelength. Simulation results show that moderate mechanical loading by gold electrodes increases the proportion of input power converted to SH-SAW. For example, with a split-electrode IDT, comprising 238 electrodes with a relative thickness h//spl lambda/ = 0.63% and surrounded by an infinitesimally thin conducting film, nearly 9% more input power is radiated as SH-SAW when gold instead of aluminum electrodes are used.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33532/01593379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33532","startPage":"402","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM/BEM impedance and power analysis measured LGS SH-SAW devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FEM/BEM impedance and power analysis measured LGS SH-SAW devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8797954","pubMedId":"16529115","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM/BEM impedance and power analysis measured LGS SH-SAW devices","sourcePdf":"01593379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062892S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33532","articleId":"1593379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1593381,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The array was manufactured using low-temperature processes suitable for CMOS electronics integration on a single chip. The measured radiation pattern of a 43 /spl times/ 140-/spl mu/m array element depicts a 40/spl deg/ view angle for forward-looking imaging around a 15-MHz center frequency in agreement with theoretical models. Pulse-echo measurements show a -10-dB fractional bandwidth of 104% around 17 MHz for wire targets 2.5 mm away from the array in vegetable oil. For imaging and SNR measurements, RF A-scan data sets from various targets were collected using an interconnect scheme forming a 32-element array configuration. An experimental point spread function was obtained and compared with simulated and theoretical array responses, showing good agreement. Therefore, this study demonstrates that annular-ring CMUT arrays fabricated with CMOS-compatible processes are capable of forward-looking IVUS imaging, and the developed modeling tools can be used to design improved IVUS imaging arrays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Annular-ring CMUT arrays for forward-looking IVUS: transducer characterization and imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593387","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33532/01593387.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Annular-ring CMUT arrays for forward-looking IVUS: transducer characterization and imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1593387/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8797961","pubMedId":"16529123","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Annular-ring CMUT arrays for forward-looking IVUS: transducer characterization and imaging","sourcePdf":"01593387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121038S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"33532","articleId":"1593387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593524,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Qian","affiliation":["University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico"],"bio":{"p":["Yi Qian yqian@ece.uprm.edu [m] is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.

The framework, called WLAN voice manager, manages admission control for voice over IP (VoIP) calls with WLANs as the access networks. WLAN voice manager interacts with WLAN medium access control (MAC) layer protocols, soft-switches (VoIP call agents), routers, and other network devices to perform end-to-end (ETE) quality of service (QoS) provisioning and control for VoIP calls originated from WLANs. By implementing the proposed WLAN voice manager in the WLAN access network, a two-level ETE VoIP QoS control mechanism can be achieved: level 1 QoS for voice traffic over WLAN medium access and level 2 QoS for ETE VoIP services in the networks with WLANs as the local access. The implementation challenges of this framework are discussed for both level 1 and level 2.

To engineer a CDMA system whose performance will no longer be interference-limited, many challenging issues should be tackled, such as novel CDMA code sets, efficient spreading and carrier modulation schemes, and signaling format for high-speed burst traffic. This article reviews our ongoing research on next-generation CDMA technologies. In particular, we propose a new CDMA code design methodology, real environment adapted linearization (REAL), which can generate CDMA code sets with inherent immunity against multipath interference and multiple access interference for both uplink and downlink transmissions. It is also shown that interference-free CDMA can only be implemented with the help of orthogonal complementary codes. The article goes further to reveal that cell-wise capacity for such interference-free CDMA is equal to the number of element codes assigned to each user, making OFDM a natural choice to implement interference-free CDMA. Several other issues of OCC-CDMA, such as its system implementation and performance, are also addressed in this article.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2006.1593527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/33537/01593527.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2006.1593527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal complementary codes for interference-free CDMA technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal complementary codes for interference-free CDMA technologies","volume":"13","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8810521","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1593527/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593527/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal complementary codes for interference-free CDMA technologies","sourcePdf":"01593527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052951S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"33537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"33537","articleId":"1593527","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593545,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

These enhancements provide significant gains in spectral efficiency and substantial improvements in QoS support relative to 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision 0. In particular, 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision A approximately doubles the uplink spectral efficiency and doubles the number of terminals with delay-sensitive applications that can be simultaneously supported on the system. It provides substantial reduction in latencies (approximately 50 percent) during both connection setup and the connected state. It offers comprehensive network control over terminal and application performance to enable the desired trade-offs between capacity and latency/ fairness, thereby providing full QoS support and enhanced user experience. It also provides coverage improvement (approximately 1.5 dB) relative to 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision 0. This enables operators to offer services such as VoIP, video telephony, mobile network gaming, push-to-talk, Web browsing, file transfer, and video on demand to a larger number of simultaneous users.

Together with quality of service (QoS) requirements, we emphasize practical issues such as mobility, degradation of feedback-channel quality, and packet overheads. Novel techniques are presented for voice processing such as smart blanking and adaptive dejitter playback buffer with time warping. These techniques help to meet QoS constraints to achieve a circuit-like voice quality while improving overall capacity. Detailed end-to-end simulations are presented and system capacity is analyzed under the QoS and system stability constraints. We claim that DO-Rev A can provide VoIP capacity comparable to circuit-switched cellular CDMA technologies (e.g., IS-2000) and simultaneously carry significant amount of other types of traffic such as non-delay sensitive applications and downlink multicast.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/33538/01593550.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2006.1593550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2006.1593550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VoIP over cdma2000 1xEV-DO revision A","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Performance analysis","Degradation","Blanking","Analytical models","Circuit simulation","Circuit stability","Stability analysis","Multiaccess communication","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","Internet telephony","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VoIP","cdma2000 1xEV-DO Revision A","mobility","capacity","quality of service","QoS","feedback-channel quality","packet overheads","voice processing","smart blanking","adaptive dejitter playback buffer","time warping","circuit-like voice quality","system capacity","DO-Rev A"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"VoIP over cdma2000 1xEV-DO revision A","volume":"44","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1593550/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8850884","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VoIP over cdma2000 1xEV-DO revision A","sourcePdf":"01593550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094925S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"33538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"33538","articleId":"1593550","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1593551,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is shown that applying interference cancellation to CDMA achieves the multiple access channel sum rate capacity for either frame synchronous or asynchronous users. The per user SINR gain from space-time interference cancellation translates directly into a CDMA capacity gain of the same factor, allowing EV-DO Rev A to support more users with higher data rates. We demonstrate how interference cancellation can be added to base station processing without modifying user terminals, EV-DO standards, or network coverage. We present commercially viable receiver architectures for implementing interference cancellation with the asynchronism and H-ARQ of EV-DO RevA, and explain why closed loop power control can operate the same way it does today. Network level simulations over a wide range of channels confirm that interference cancellation offers significant capacity gains for all users, while maintaining the same link budget and system stability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing interference cancellation to increase the EV-DO Rev A reverse link capacity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2006.1593551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/33538/01593551.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2006.1593551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Implementing interference cancellation to increase the EV-DO Rev A reverse link capacity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1593551/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8850885","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing interference cancellation to increase the EV-DO Rev A reverse link capacity","sourcePdf":"01593551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049522S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"33538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"33538","articleId":"1593551","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1593567,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We discuss the implementation of temperature sensor. The fully integrated complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) batteryless device measures temperature and performs calibration to compensate for the sensor's inherent imperfections.

This challenge is aggravated if new types of processes and components are introduced, as existing components are expected to interact with the novel entities but have no previous knowledge on how to collaborate. This statement not only applies to innovative processes and devices, but is also due to the impossibility to incorporate knowledge in a single device about all types of available system components. This paper proposes the use of Semantic Web Services in order to overcome this challenge. The use of ontologies and explicit semantics enable performing logical reasoning to infer sufficient knowledge on the classification of processes that machines offer, and on how to execute and compose those processes to carry out manufacturing orchestration autonomously. A series of motivating utilization scenarios are illustrated, and a research roadmap is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic web services in factory automation: fundamental insights and research roadmap","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2005.862144","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/33541/01593597.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2005.862144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Semantic web services in factory automation: fundamental insights and research roadmap","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593597/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8810018","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic web services in factory automation: fundamental insights and research roadmap","sourcePdf":"01593597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103717S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"33541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"33541","articleId":"1593597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1593601,"authors":[{"name":"Hing Kai Chan","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/33541/1593601/1593601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hing Kai Chan (M'98\u2013SM'04) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.Sc. degree in industrial engineering and industrial management, both from the University of Hong Kong, in 1995 and 2000, respectively.

Although these approaches have been shown to be effective, most of them were developed without considering uncertainties in supply chains to simplify the analysis. In fact, uncertainties can deteriorate the performance of supply chains, such as increase in total cost, or drop in fill rate, of the whole system. In distributed supply chains, participating members are not under a sole control by a central authority, the problem is even more stringent due to incomplete information sharing, or so called asymmetrical information sharing. One way to improve the system performance is to achieve coordination among participating parties through establishment of contracts. The objectives of this paper are i) to evaluate the effects of demand uncertainty in a distributed supply chain, which is modelled as an agent-based system; ii) to propose a coordination mechanism with early order completion contract to minimize the negative impacts of demand uncertainty; and iii) to present associated simulation results. Performance of the system is measured in terms of costs and fill rate. Simulation results indicate that the proposed contract approach is able to improve the performance measures of the system.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2005.864217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","startPage":"48","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2005.864217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33541","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/33541/01593601.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Uncertainty","Supply chains","Modeling","Costs","Centralized control","System performance","Supply chain management","Couplings","Globalization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supply chain management","contracts","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["early order completion contract","demand uncertainty","distributed supply chains","agent-based system","supply chain management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contract","coordination","simulation","supply chain management","uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Early order completion contract approach to minimize the impact of demand uncertainty on supply chains","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593601/","volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593601/","accessionNumber":"8810022","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early order completion contract approach to minimize the impact of demand uncertainty on supply chains","sourcePdf":"01593601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066042S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"33541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33541","articleId":"1593601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1593611,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The additional challenge is to solve this problem in the context of multiple moving sources. An effective and simple technique for both separation and localization of EEG sources is therefore proposed by incorporating an algorithmically coupled blind source separation (BSS) approach. The method relies upon having a priori knowledge of the locations of a subset of the sources. The cost function of the BSS algorithm is constrained by this information, and the unknown sources are iteratively calculated. An important application of this method is to localize abnormal sources, which, for example, cause changes in attention, movement, and behavior. In this application, the Alpha rhythm was considered as the known sources.

However, such kinds of learning algorithms usually cannot minimize the empirical risk (training error) and expected risk (testing error) simultaneously, and thus cannot reach a good classification performance in the testing phase. To tackle this drawback, a support-vector-based fuzzy neural network (SVFNN) is proposed for pattern classification in this paper. The SVFNN combines the superior classification power of support vector machine (SVM) in high dimensional data spaces and the efficient human-like reasoning of FNN in handling uncertainty information. A learning algorithm consisting of three learning phases is developed to construct the SVFNN and train its parameters. In the first phase, the fuzzy rules and membership functions are automatically determined by the clustering principle. In the second phase, the parameters of FNN are calculated by the SVM with the proposed adaptive fuzzy kernel function. In the third phase, the relevant fuzzy rules are selected by the proposed reducing fuzzy rule method. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SVFNN classification, it is applied to the Iris, Vehicle, Dna, Satimage, Ijcnn1 datasets from the UCI Repository, Statlog collection and IJCNN challenge 2001, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed SVFNN for pattern classification can achieve good classification performance with drastically reduced number of fuzzy kernel functions.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.861604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/33544/01593641.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.861604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support-vector-based fuzzy neural network for pattern classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593641/","displayDocTitle":"Support-vector-based fuzzy neural network for pattern classification","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8855111","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1593641/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support-vector-based fuzzy neural network for pattern classification","sourcePdf":"01593641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096279S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"33544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"33544","articleId":"1593641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593644,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Yow Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/33544/1593644/1593644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuang-Yow Lian (S'91\u2013M'94) received the B.S. in engineering science from National Cheng-Kung University and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taiwan, in 1984 and 1996, respectively.","From 1986 to 1988, he served as a Control Engineer at ITRI.

The output regulation problems of a basic buck converter and a zero-voltage-transition (ZVT) buck converter are used as application examples to illustrate the control performance of the proposed methodology. First, we consider a general nonlinear system which can represent the large-signal models of the converters. After introducing an added integral state of output regulation error and taking coordinate translation on an equilibrium point, the resulting augmented system is represented into a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. Then, the concept of parallel distributed compensation is applied to design the control law whereby the control gains are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

A fuzzy vector B is an n-tuple of fuzzy numbers. Since fuzzy numbers are often associated with linguistic terms, such as \"small,\" \"medium,\" etc., a fuzzy vector can also be called a linguistic vector. Similarly, an HMM that processes linguistic vectors can be called a \"linguistic HMM.\" The derivation of the linguistic HMM (LHMM) from the continuous HMM is performed using the extension principle and the decomposition theorem. We prove that a LHMM behaves in the same fashion as the CHMM in the degenerate linguistic case when the fuzzy numbers are singletons (real numbers). We also provide an example where an LHMM was used for the recognition of a play (pick-and-shoot) during a basketball game. The positions of the players were described using spatial fuzzy relations. For the recognition experiment, we generated two sets of 100 sequences containing pick-and-shoot and non pick-and-shoot sequences, respectively. The LHMM results obtained for the fuzzy sequences were compared to the CHMM results obtained on a crisp version of the same sequences. The results obtained showed that the fuzzy spatial relations together with the LHMM provide a better description of the movement than the CHMM.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.861615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/33544/01593645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.861615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33544","startPage":"81","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy spatial pattern processing using linguistic hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy spatial pattern processing using linguistic hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8855115","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593645/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy spatial pattern processing using linguistic hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"01593645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065829S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"33544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33544","articleId":"1593645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593648,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Kwun Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/33544/1593648/1593648-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sung-Kwun Oh (M'98) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1981, 1983, and 1993, respectively.","During 1983\u20131989, he was a Senior Researcher of the R&D Laboratory of Lucky-Goldstar Industrial Systems Co., Ltd., Anyang, Korea.

The study offers a comprehensive design methodology involving mechanisms of genetic optimization, especially those exploiting genetic algorithms (GAs). Let us recall that the design of the \"conventional\" FPNNs uses an extended group method of data handling (GMDH) and uses a fixed scheme of fuzzy inference (such as simplified, linear, and regression polynomial fuzzy inference) in each FPN of the network. It also considers a fixed number of input nodes (as being selected in advance by a network designer) at FPNs (or nodes) located in each layer. However such design process does not guarantee that the resulting FPNs will always result in an optimal networks architecture. Here, the development of the FPNN gives rise to a structurally optimized topology and comes with a substantial level of flexibility which becomes apparent when contrasted with the one we encounter in the conventional FPNNs. The design of each layer of the FPNN deals with its structural optimization involving a selection of preferred nodes (or FPNs) with specific local characteristics (such as the number of input variables, the order of the polynomial forming a consequent part of fuzzy rules and a collection of the specific subset of input variables) and addresses detailed aspects of parametric optimization. Along this line, two general optimization mechanisms are explored. The structural optimization is realized via GAs. In case of the parametric optimization we proceed with a standard least square method-based learning. Through the consecutive process of such structural and parametric optimization, an optimized and flexible fuzzy neural network becomes generated in a dynamic fashion. To evaluate the performance of the genetically optimized FPNN (gFPNN), we experimented with two time series data (gas furnace and chaotic time series) as well as some synthetic data. A comparative analysis reveals that the proposed FPNN exhibits higher accuracy and superb predictive capability in comparison to some previous models available in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593648/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8855118","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593648/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetically optimized fuzzy polynomial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetically optimized fuzzy polynomial neural networks","sourcePdf":"01593648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116659S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"33544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"33544","articleId":"1593648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1593649,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/33544/1593649/1593649-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong-Jong Wai (M'99\u2013A'00\u2013SM'05) was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1974.

In this study, a robust fuzzy-neural-network (FNN) control system is implemented to control a dual-axis inverted-pendulum mechanism that is driven by permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motors. The energy conservation principle is adopted to build a mathematical model of the motor-mechanism-coupled system. Moreover, a robust FNN control system is developed for stabilizing and tracking control of the dual-axis inverted-pendulum system. In this control system, a FNN controller is used to learn an equivalent control law as in the traditional sliding-mode control, and a robust controller is designed to ensure the near total sliding motion through the entire state trajectory without a reaching phase. The salient advantages of this FNN-based control scheme are as follows. 1) It does not require a perfect knowledge of system uncertainties so that this brings a high level of autonomy to the overall system and make the use of this control scheme very attractive for real time applications. 2) All adaptive learning algorithms in this control system are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability analysis, so that system-tracking stability can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. 3) Not only the weight vector in the rule-to-output layer are adjusted on line but also the mean and the standard deviation of Gaussian functions in the membership function layer. This training scheme will increase the learning capability of the FNN. 4) An adaptive bound estimation algorithm is investigated to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertain term including the minimum reconstructed error, higher-order term in Taylor series, and network parameters approximation error. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy can be verified by numerical simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859305","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/33544/01593649.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilizing and tracking control of nonlinear dual-axis inverted-pendulum system using fuzzy neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing and tracking control of nonlinear dual-axis inverted-pendulum system using fuzzy neural network","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8855119","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593649/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing and tracking control of nonlinear dual-axis inverted-pendulum system using fuzzy neural network","sourcePdf":"01593649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124164S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"33544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"33544","articleId":"1593649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1593659,"authors":[{"name":"O.G.

Our primary application is on missing regions of pixels containing textures, edges, and other image features that are not readily handled by prevalent estimation and recovery algorithms. We assume that we are given a linear transform that is expected to provide sparse decompositions over missing regions such that a portion of the transform coefficients over missing regions are zero or close to zero. We adaptively determine these small magnitude coefficients through thresholding, establish sparsity constraints, and estimate missing regions in images using information surrounding these regions. Unlike prevalent algorithms, our approach does not necessitate any complex preconditioning, segmentation, or edge detection steps, and it can be written as a sequence of denoising operations. We show that the region types we can effectively estimate in a mean-squared error sense are those for which the given transform provides a close approximation using sparse nonlinear approximants. We show the nature of the constructed estimators and how these estimators relate to the utilized transform and its sparsity over regions of interest. The developed estimation framework is general, and can readily be applied to other nonstationary signals with a suitable choice of linear transforms.

Traditionally the Hough transform, (a special case of the Radon transform) has been widely used to solve this problem for binary images. In this paper, we pose the problem of detecting straight lines in gray-scale images as an inverse problem. Our formulation is based on use of the inverse Radon operator, which relates the parameters determining the location and orientation of the lines in the image to the noisy input image. The advantage of this formulation is that we can then approach the problem of line detection within a regularization framework and enhance the performance of the Hough-based line detector through the incorporation of prior information in the form of regularization. We discuss the type of regularizers that are useful for this problem and derive efficient computational schemes to solve the resulting optimization problems enabling their use in large applications. Finally, we show how our new approach can be alternatively viewed as one of finding an optimal representation of the noisy image in terms of elements chosen from a dictionary of lines. This interpretation relates the problem of Hough-based line finding to the body of work on adaptive signal representation.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.863021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33545/01593662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.863021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33545","startPage":"582","endPage":"591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line detection in images through regularized hough transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Line detection in images through regularized hough transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8854280","pubMedId":"16519345","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593662/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line detection in images through regularized hough transform","sourcePdf":"01593662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055185S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"33545","articleId":"1593662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593663,"authors":[{"name":"Hu He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/33545/1593663/1593663-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hu He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","His research interests include digital image processing and video communications, with s focus on super-resolution and restoration."]},"lastName":"Hu He","id":"37278860400"},{"name":"L.P.

In this respect, we analyze cases where the probability of signal presence is 1) fixed per subband, 2) conditioned on a local spatial context, and 3) conditioned on information from multiple image bands. All the probabilities are estimated assuming a generalized Laplacian prior for noise-free subband data and additive white Gaussian noise. The results demonstrate that the new subband-adaptive shrinkage function outperforms Bayesian thresholding approaches in terms of mean-squared error. The spatially adaptive version of the proposed method yields better results than the existing spatially adaptive ones of similar and higher complexity. The performance on color and on multispectral images is superior with respect to recent multiband wavelet thresholding.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.863698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.863698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33545/01593669.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating the probability of the presence of a signal of interest in multiresolution single- and multiband image denoising","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the probability of the presence of a signal of interest in multiresolution single- and multiband image denoising","volume":"15","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8854287","pubMedId":"16519352","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1593669/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the probability of the presence of a signal of interest in multiresolution single- and multiband image denoising","sourcePdf":"01593669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084417S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"274","xplore-issue":"33545","articleId":"1593669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593689,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xu","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications CERCIA, School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK","City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/33546/1593689/1593689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Xu (M'06) received the M.Sc. degree in applied optics and lasers from Fujian Normal University, China, in 1987, and the Ph.D. degree in physics specializing in nature-inspired approaches to optical network design from Xiamen University, China, in 2002.","In 1978, he joined Fujian Normal University, where he is a professor.

As a measure of the prediction fitness potential, an expected utility criterion is considered which is consistently estimated by a sample-reuse computation. As opposed to classic point-prediction-based cross-validation methods, this expected utility is defined from the logarithmic score of the neural model predictive probability density. It is shown how the advocated choice of a conjugate probability distribution as prior for the parameters of a competing network, allows a consistent approximation of the network posterior predictive density. A comparison of the performances of the proposed method with the performances of usual selection procedures based on classic cross-validation and information-theoretic criteria, is performed first on a simulated case study, and then on a well known food analysis dataset.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2005.860883","startPage":"35","endPage":"47","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2005.860883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33546","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/33546/01593690.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian multioutput feedforward neural networks comparison: a conjugate prior approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593690/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian multioutput feedforward neural networks comparison: a conjugate prior approach","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593690/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8843260","pubMedId":"16526474","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian multioutput feedforward neural networks comparison: a conjugate prior approach","sourcePdf":"01593690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105468S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"33546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33546","articleId":"1593690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593693,"authors":[{"name":"Jinn-Tsong Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Medical Information Management, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/33546/1593693/1593693-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinn-Tsong Tsai received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan, in June 1986 and June 1988, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering science and technology from National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, in June 2004.","He is currently an Assistant Professor of Medical Information Management Department at Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.

The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2005.860885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/33546/01593693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2005.860885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33546","startPage":"69","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning the structure and parameters of a neural network by using hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tuning the structure and parameters of a neural network by using hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8843263","pubMedId":"16526477","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593693/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning the structure and parameters of a neural network by using hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"01593693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0788S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"33546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"33546","articleId":"1593693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1593694,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is modified to efficiently transform a multiclass- (rather than numerical-) valued function over a multidimensional (rather than low dimensional) domain, or transform a multiclass-valued decision tree into another useful representation. We prove that this multidimensional, multiclass DWT uses dynamic programming to minimize (within its framework) the number of nontrivial wavelet coefficients needed to summarize a training set or decision tree. It is a spatially localized algorithm that takes linear time in the number of training samples, after a sort. Convergence of the DWT to benchmark training sets seems to degrade with rising dimension in this test of high dimensional wavelets, which have been seen as difficult to implement. This multiclass multidimensional DWT has tightly coupled applications from learning \"dyadic\" decision trees directly from training data, rebalancing or converting preexisting decision trees to fixed depth boolean or threshold neural networks (in effect parallelizing the evaluation of the trees), or learning rule/exception sets represented as a new form of tree called an \"E-tree,\" which could greatly help interpretation/visualization of a dataset.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2005.860830","startPage":"81","endPage":"93","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/33546/01593694.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2005.860830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized haar DWT and transformations between decision trees and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Decision trees","Neural networks","Multidimensional systems","Discrete transforms","Dynamic programming","Wavelet coefficients","Convergence","Benchmark testing","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Haar transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","decision trees","neural nets","dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Haar discrete wavelet transform","decision trees","neural network","dynamic programming","training set","E-tree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision tree rebalancing","fault tolerance","Haar wavelet","multiclass","rule generation","threshold network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Generalized haar DWT and transformations between decision trees and neural networks","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593694/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8843264","pubMedId":"16526478","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized haar DWT and transformations between decision trees and neural networks","sourcePdf":"01593694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104028S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"33546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33546","articleId":"1593694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1593696,"authors":[{"name":"Shangjiang Guo","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Econometrics, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China","Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/33546/1593696/1593696-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shangjiang Guo received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in applied mathematics from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","He is an Associate Professor of mathematics at Hunan University.

In this paper, first, a deterministic learning mechanism is presented, by which an appropriately designed adaptive neural controller is capable of learning closed-loop system dynamics during tracking control to a periodic reference orbit. Among various neural network (NN) architectures, the localized radial basis function (RBF) network is employed. A property of persistence of excitation (PE) for RBF networks is established, and a partial PE condition of closed-loop signals, i.e., the PE condition of a regression subvector constructed out of the RBFs along a periodic state trajectory, is proven to be satisfied. Accurate NN approximation for closed-loop system dynamics is achieved in a local region along the periodic state trajectory, and a learning ability is implemented during a closed-loop feedback control process. Second, based on the deterministic learning mechanism, a neural learning control scheme is proposed which can effectively recall and reuse the learned knowledge to achieve closed-loop stability and improved control performance. The significance of this paper is that the presented deterministic learning mechanism and the neural learning control scheme provide elementary components toward the development of a biologically-plausible learning and control methodology. Simulation studies are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning from neural control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2005.860843","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/33546/01593698.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2005.860843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593698/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Learning from neural control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593698/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8843268","pubMedId":"16526482","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning from neural control","sourcePdf":"01593698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114738S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"33546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"263","xplore-issue":"33546","articleId":"1593698","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1593699,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhi Gao","affiliation":["Rockwell Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/33546/1593699/1593699-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenzhi Gao was born in Luoyang, Henan, China, in 1970.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are the two most popular linear dimensionality reduction methods. However, PCA is not very effective for the extraction of the most discriminant features, and LDA is not stable due to the small sample size problem . In this paper, we propose some new (linear and nonlinear) feature extractors based on maximum margin criterion (MMC). Geometrically, feature extractors based on MMC maximize the (average) margin between classes after dimensionality reduction. It is shown that MMC can represent class separability better than PCA. As a connection to LDA, we may also derive LDA from MMC by incorporating some constraints. By using some other constraints, we establish a new linear feature extractor that does not suffer from the small sample size problem, which is known to cause serious stability problems for LDA. The kernelized (nonlinear) counterpart of this linear feature extractor is also established in the paper. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the new feature extractors are effective, stable, and efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8843270","pubMedId":"16526484","htmlLink":"/document/1593700/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient and robust feature extraction by maximum margin criterion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and robust feature extraction by maximum margin criterion","sourcePdf":"01593700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081449S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"33546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"580","xplore-issue":"33546","articleId":"1593700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593701,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The ensemble-based approach is based on the recently emerged technique known as \"boosting\". However, it is generally believed that boosting-like learning rules are not suited to a strong and stable learner such as LDA. To break the limitation, a novel weakness analysis theory is developed here. The theory attempts to boost a strong learner by increasing the diversity between the classifiers created by the learner, at the expense of decreasing their margins, so as to achieve a tradeoff suggested by recent boosting studies for a low generalization error. In addition, a novel distribution accounting for the pairwise class discriminant information is introduced for effective interaction between the booster and the LDA-based learner. The integration of all these methodologies proposed here leads to the novel ensemble-based discriminant learning approach, capable of taking advantage of both the boosting and LDA techniques. Promising experimental results obtained on various difficult face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We believe that this work is especially beneficial in extending the boosting framework to accommodate general (strong/weak) learners.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593701/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8832756","pubMedId":"16526485","htmlLink":"/document/1593701/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ensemble-based discriminant learning with boosting for face recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble-based discriminant learning with boosting for face recognition","sourcePdf":"01593701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103018S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"33546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"33546","articleId":"1593701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1593704,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Generally, multilength codes are designed to support multirate services, while the multiweight codes are designed to support differentiated quality of service (QoS) for multimedia applications. However, existing optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are limited to single class or multiclass with restricted weight and length properties. Therefore, there exists a lack of flexibility in the existing OOCs to support arbitrary rate and QoS. This paper presents a proposal of generation procedure and performance analysis of joint multiweight multilength strict OOCs. The approach used in this paper is to apply a methodology strongly relying on developed analytical theory that is supported by computer optimization, because it has turned out that it is mathematically intractable to construct unconstraint joint multilength multiweight OOCs using pure algebraic techniques. The generated code set fulfills the conditions of strictly OOCs, namely, the maximum nonzero shift autocorrelation and the maximum cross correlation constraints of one. The mark position difference (MPD) approach is used to generate in a flexible way the multiclass code set. The MPD results in the simple evaluation of multiclass code set cardinality. Furthermore, the multiple-access interference (MAI) in a multiclass OOC system is evaluated by modeling the interference per class as a Poisson distribution to simplify performance evaluation with acceptable accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.862439","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33548/01593738.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.862439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass optical orthogonal codes for multiservice optical CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593738/","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass optical orthogonal codes for multiservice optical CDMA networks","volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8848754","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1593738/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass optical orthogonal codes for multiservice optical CDMA networks","sourcePdf":"01593738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083025S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"33548","articleId":"1593738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1593746,"authors":[{"name":"I.B.

polarization-mode dispersion (PMD), and polarization-dependent loss (PDL) on the intensity noise suppression of spectrum-sliced incoherent light sources achieved by using gain-saturated (GS) semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are investigated. Passing the spectrum-sliced incoherent light through SOAs, the excess intensity noise (EIN) originating from beating of spontaneous emission against itself can be greatly reduced. However, since the noise suppression is achieved by an elaborate balancing between numerous frequency/polarization components of light, thus, forming a high correlation between them, it is vulnerable to frequency/polarization-dependent optical phenomena. Through Q-factor and bit error rate (BER) measurements, this paper shows that CD, PMD, or PDL deteriorates the SOA-based noise suppression technique by breaking the correlation. Spectral analysis is also performed to investigate the frequency dependency of these effects. It is shown that CD and PMD negate the noise suppression giving rise to intensity noise from high frequencies, whereas there is no frequency dependence for PDL effects. Therefore, CD-, PMD-, or PDL-induced penalties for incoherent light sources using the SOA-based noise suppression technique are considerably greater than those produced by pulse broadening or distortion alone.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593747/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8848763","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Impact of dispersion, PMD, and PDL on the performance of spectrum-sliced incoherent light sources using gain-saturated semiconductor optical amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of dispersion, PMD, and PDL on the performance of spectrum-sliced incoherent light sources using gain-saturated semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01593747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072558S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"33548","articleId":"1593747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1593768,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["Lightwave Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/33548/1593768/1593768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Chen received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1988, 1990, and 1994, respectively.","From 1994 to 1999, he was an Associate Professor at the Department of Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

To the authors' best knowledge, it is the first time that Raman amplifiers of more than one stage are considered in the design process so as to optimize multistage amplifier performance simultaneously. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that optical power path integrals among several stages can, in principle, be arbitrarily redistributed while maintaining its gain performance, as long as the consolidated sums at different pump wavelengths are unaltered. The overall gain spectrum of a multistage FRA is thus very close to the cumulative spectrum of chained identical single-stage amplifiers with span numbers equal to its stages. However, the traditional prerequisite to minimize gain flatness in every stage is no longer required. It provides flexibilities to take full advantage of pump lasers with moderate launched powers and allows the reduction of the number of pump lasers and/or wavelengths in most stages. By arranging small positive net gain to the first stages and enhancing it at shorter signal wavelengths, significant reduction and flattening of total noise figure (NF) is achieved even if a pure backward pumping scheme is utilized. Finally, various pumping configurations for Raman amplifiers with hybrid dispersion-compensating fiber (DCF) and standard single-mode fiber (SMF) are discussed, with the objective of realizing flattened gain and noise performance simultaneously without using forward pumps.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.861937","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33548/01593768.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"944","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.861937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of multistage gain-flattened fiber Raman amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of multistage gain-flattened fiber Raman amplifiers","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1593768/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8848784","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multistage gain-flattened fiber Raman amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01593768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087094S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33548","articleId":"1593768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1593782,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu-Pyung Hwang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kyu-Pyung Hwang (S'94\u2013M'02) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1993, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, in 2002.","He has been with Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, since 2002, where he is involved with research activities on high-speed interconnects, power delivery, and package-embedded passive components.

A coherent underwater acoustic communication system must deal with the inter-symbol interference caused by the time-varying, dispersive, shallow-water ocean environment. An approach is demonstrated that takes advantage of the focal properties of time reversal. The spatial and temporal compression available at the time-reversal focus mitigates channel fading, reduces the dispersion caused by the channel, and increases the signal strength. Thus, a time-reversal communication system does not require spatial diversity at the receiver, i.e., an array of receiving sensors, but takes advantage of spatial diversity at the transmitter. The time-reversal communications system concept is demonstrated using experimental data collected in shallow water. Data telemetry bit rates of 500 bps (BPSK) and 1000 bps (QPSK) with bit error rates of 0 out of 4976 bits and 254 out of 9953 bits, respectively, were obtained when transmitting to a receiver at a distance of 10 km, with a carrier frequency of 3500 Hz, and a 500 Hz bandwidth. In a shallow-water upslope region, bit error rates of 15 out of 4976 bits and 14 out of 4976 bits were achieved over the same distance. In neither case was complex processing at the receiver used (i.e., channel equalization, error correction coding). Time-reversal transmissions are intercompared with single source and broadside transmissions and shown to have superior results in both range independent and dependent bathymetries. The time-reversal performance appears limited by self-generated inter-symbol interference. In addition, an initial look at the application of a single channel adaptive channel equalizer to received time-reversal communication sequences is presented. The same properties that are beneficial to a single channel receiver are also beneficial to adaptive channel equalization. A single channel RLS DFE equalizer is cascaded with the received time-reversal sequences and shown to further reduce scatter in the I/Q plane. The bit error rate decreased in all but one of the cases","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2005.862137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/33550/01593829.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2005.862137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater acoustic communications using time reversal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Underwater acoustic communications using time reversal","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8819987","htmlLink":"/document/1593829/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater acoustic communications using time reversal","sourcePdf":"01593829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076118S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"33550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"33550","articleId":"1593829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593830,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

This work is motivated by the superior performance [bit error rate (BER)] of the multichannel DFE compared with other methods, such as passive-phase conjugation (PPC), at the same time noting its sensitivity to different acoustic environments. The approach is to couple PPC, utilizing its adaptability to different environments, with a single-channel DFE. This coupling forms an optimal processor for acoustic communications in theory, but it has never been implemented in practice. By coupling with DFE, the method achieves the same spatial diversity as conventional multichannel DFE, without requiring a large number of receivers as does PPC. The correlation-based DFE in terms of the autocorrelation functions of the channel impulse responses summed over the receiver channels (the Q function) is derived. This paper shows in terms of waveguide physics, further supported by real data, the many desirable features of the Q function that suggest, given adequate sampling of the water column, a general applicability of the correlation-based equalizer to different environments, irrespective of the sound speed profiles, bottom properties, and source-receiver ranges/depths. This property can be expected to hold approximately for a small number of receivers with spatial diversity. This paper demonstrates the robustness of the new equalizer with moving source data despite the range change (which modifies the impulse response) and symbol phase change due to time-varying Doppler","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2005.862126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/33550/01593830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2005.862126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33550","startPage":"865","endPage":"880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation-based decision-feedback equalizer for underwater acoustic communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Correlation-based decision-feedback equalizer for underwater acoustic communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8819988","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593830/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation-based decision-feedback equalizer for underwater acoustic communications","sourcePdf":"01593830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067873S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"33550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"33550","articleId":"1593830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593865,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It reports on the experience of using the technique of problem-based learning as a key pedagogical method for teaching practical network design within the context of a Master's program module in data telecommunications and networks at the University of Salford, Salford, Greater Manchester, U.K. A two-threaded approach was adopted that comprised a problem-based learning thread and a conventional lecture thread. The problem-based learning thread within the module comprised sessions designed to place the students in the position of network design consultants who are introduced to scenarios that have a high degree of realism in which a client has specific business requirements that can be met through the adoption of a network solution. In this way, the problem-based learning thread allows the students to develop their design skills, while the lecture thread uses traditional teaching methods to allow students to develop their understanding of key network components and architectures. A formal evaluation of this approach has been carried out and demonstrated a very effective and realistic learning experience for the students. Therefore, the authors propose that problem-based learning is an ideal pedagogical tool for the teaching of computer network design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593865/","volume":"49","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1593865/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8850725","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Problem-based learning as an effective tool for teaching computer network design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Problem-based learning as an effective tool for teaching computer network design","sourcePdf":"01593865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043166S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"33552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"33552","articleId":"1593865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593869,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

In this paper, we extend the theory of vector Lyapunov functions by constructing a generalized comparison system whose vector field can be a function of the comparison system states as well as the nonlinear dynamical system states. Furthermore, we present a generalized convergence result which, in the case of a scalar comparison system, specializes to the classical Krasovskii-LaSalle invariant set theorem. In addition, we introduce the notion of a control vector Lyapunov function as a generalization of control Lyapunov functions, and show that asymptotic stabilizability of a nonlinear dynamical system is equivalent to the existence of a control vector Lyapunov function. Moreover, using control vector Lyapunov functions, we construct a universal decentralized feedback control law for a decentralized nonlinear dynamical system that possesses guaranteed gain and sector margins in each decentralized input channel. Furthermore, we establish connections between the recently developed notion of vector dissipativity and optimality of the proposed decentralized feedback control law. Finally, the proposed control framework is used to construct decentralized controllers for large-scale nonlinear systems with robustness guarantees against full modeling uncertainty.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Lyapunov method","Feedback control","Standards development","Stability analysis","Convergence","Large-scale systems","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","Lyapunov methods","vectors","set theory","asymptotic stability","decentralised control","feedback","large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","vector Lyapunov functions","stability analysis","generalized convergence","scalar comparison system","Krasovskii-LaSalle invariant set theorem","universal decentralized feedback control law","vector dissipativity","optimality","large-scale nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Comparison principle","control vector Lyapunov functions","decentralized control","gain and sector margins","invariance principle","inverse optimality","large-scale systems","partial stability","vector Lyapunov functions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2005.863496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/33553/01593896.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2005.863496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the stability and control of nonlinear dynamical systems via vector Lyapunov functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the stability and control of nonlinear dynamical systems via vector Lyapunov functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593896/","volume":"51","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1593896/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8850680","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the stability and control of nonlinear dynamical systems via vector Lyapunov functions","sourcePdf":"01593896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127239S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"33553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"33553","articleId":"1593896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1593899,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering and the Center for Information and Systems Engineering, Boston University, Brooklyn, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/33553/1593899/1593899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Li received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in control theory and control engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

The team objective is to maximize the total reward accumulated over a given time interval. Complicating factors include uncertainties regarding the locations of target points and the effectiveness of collecting rewards, differences among vehicle capabilities, and the fact that rewards are time-varying. We propose a receding horizon (RH) controller suitable for dynamic and uncertain environments, where combinatorially complex assignment algorithms are infeasible. The control scheme dynamically determines vehicle trajectories by solving a sequence of optimization problems over a planning horizon and executing them over a shorter action horizon. This centralized scheme can generate stationary trajectories in the sense that they guide vehicles to target points, even though the controller is not explicitly designed to perform any discrete point assignments. This paper establishes conditions under which this stationarity property holds in settings that are analytically tractable, quantifies the cooperative properties of the controller, and includes a number of illustrative simulation examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","volume":"51","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593899/","accessionNumber":"8850683","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative receding horizon controller for multivehicle uncertain environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative receding horizon controller for multivehicle uncertain environments","sourcePdf":"01593899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117309S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"33553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"33553","articleId":"1593899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1593905,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengtao Ding","affiliation":["Control Systems Centre, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"lastName":"Zhengtao Ding","id":"37087204643"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"1593905","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Output feedback","Control systems","Amplitude estimation","Phase estimation","Linear systems","Frequency estimation","Control design","Automatic control","Feedforward systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","nonlinear control systems","linear systems","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic rejection","general periodic disturbances","output feedback","nonlinear systems","disturbance rejection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disturbance rejection","nonlinear systems","output feedback","stabilization"]}],"abstract":"This note deals with asymptotic rejection of general periodic disturbances in nonlinear systems. A novel approach based on integrations over the half of disturbance period is proposed to estimate disturbances which may not be harmonic or even smooth. The proposed algorithm uses the period and the knowledge of the basic disturbance patterns, while the amplitude and phase of the disturbances are unknown, and they are estimated. Based on the estimated disturbance, the disturbance rejection algorithm is then proposed for linear systems and nonlinear systems in the output feedback format, which asymptotically rejects the periodical disturbances. The proposed algorithm extends asymptotic rejection of unknown disturbances from sinusoidal disturbances to a more general class of periodical disturbances which includes zero-mean square waves, symmetric triangular waves etc.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2005.863523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/33553/01593905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2005.863523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33553","startPage":"303","endPage":"308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic rejection of general periodic disturbances in output-feedback nonlinear systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic rejection of general periodic disturbances in output-feedback nonlinear systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8850689","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593905/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic rejection of general periodic disturbances in output-feedback nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"01593905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067583S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"33553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"33553","articleId":"1593905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1593916,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Bo Ji","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Hai-Bo Ji","id":"37398694500"},{"name":"Hong-Sheng Xi","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Hong-Sheng Xi","id":"37268506500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"1593916","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":168,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1121},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Nonlinear systems","Interpolation","Stochastic resonance","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Probability","Backstepping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","feedback","stochastic systems","nonlinear control systems","stability","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive output-feedback tracking","stochastic nonlinear systems","canonical systems","Wiener noises","filtered transformation","backstepping techniques","stochastic control design","adaptive control","global stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stability in probability","stochastic adaptive stabilization","stochastic disturbance attenuation"]}],"abstract":"We address the adaptive stabilization and tracking problems for a class of output feedback canonical systems driven by Wiener noises of unknown covariance.

The proposed circuit is composed of phase-controlled Class-DE inverter and Class-E rectifier. The proposed circuit achieves the fixed frequency control without frequency harmonics lower than the switching frequency. Moreover, it is possible to achieve the continuous control in a wide range of the line and load variations. The output voltage decreases in proportion to the increase of the phase shift. The proposed converter keeps the advantages of Class-DE-E dc-dc converter, namely, a high power conversion efficiency under a high-frequency operation and low switch-voltage stress. Especially, high power conversion efficiency can be kept for narrow range control. We present numerical calculations for the design and the numerical analyses to clarify the characteristics of the proposed control. By carrying out circuit experiments, we show a quantitative similarity between the numerical predictions and the experimental results. In our experiments, the measured efficiency is over 84% with 2.5 W output power for 1.0-MHz operating frequency at the nominal operation. Moreover, the output voltage is regulated from 100% to 39%, keeping over 57% power conversion efficiency by using the proposed control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","volume":"53","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"8937984","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1593932/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Phase control for resonant DC-DC converter with class-DE inverter and class-E rectifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase control for resonant DC-DC converter with class-DE inverter and class-E rectifier","sourcePdf":"01593932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085311S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33554","articleId":"1593932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1593933,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In contrast, this paper presents the design and demonstration of a variable-capacitance vibration energy harvester that combines an asynchronous diode-based charge pump with an inductive energy flyback circuit to deliver 1.8 /spl mu/W to a resistive load. A cantilever beam variable capacitor with a 650-pF dc capacitance and a 348-pF zero-to-peak ac capacitance, formed by a 43.56cm/sup 2/ spring steel top plate attached to an aluminum base, drives the charge pump at its out-of-plane resonant frequency of 1.56 kHz. The entire harvester requires only one gated MOSFET for energy flyback control, greatly simplifying the clocking scheme and avoiding synchronization issues. Furthermore, the system exhibits a startup voltage requirement below 89 mV, indicating that it can potentially be turned on using just a piezoelectric film.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.856043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33554/01593935.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.856043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33554","startPage":"288","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A variable-capacitance vibration-to-electric energy harvester","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A variable-capacitance vibration-to-electric energy harvester","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8937987","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1593935/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A variable-capacitance vibration-to-electric energy harvester","sourcePdf":"01593935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045575S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"33554","articleId":"1593935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593941,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The proposed approaches are called variance-oriented approaches (VOAs). The VOA is then applied to three proposed receiver structures, especially the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) scheme that is generally the concept of spatial domain in beamforming system, to eliminate the MAI by one particular constraint in temporal domain. Besides, by this constraint, GSC filter possesses the property of global convergence in multipath environment once the channel estimation is appropriate.

According to a commonly used model, the error caused by timing jitter, integrated over the whole bandwidth, should not be bigger than the quantization noise, for a full swing input signals at the maximum input frequency. This results in unfeasible phase noise requirements for the sampling clock in software radio receivers with direct RF sampling. However, for a radio receiver not the total integrated error is relevant, but only the error signal in the channel bandwidth. This paper explores the clock jitter requirements for a software radio application, using a more realistic model and taking into account the power spectrum of both the input signal and the spectrum of the sampling clock jitter. Using this model, we show that the clock jitter requirements are very similar to reciprocal mixing requirements of superheterodyne receivers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2005.856893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/33555/01593962.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"94","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2005.856893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jitter requirements of the sampling clock in software radio receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Jitter requirements of the sampling clock in software radio receivers","volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1593962/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8938005","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jitter requirements of the sampling clock in software radio receivers","sourcePdf":"01593962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049476S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"33555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"33555","articleId":"1593962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1593965,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Although the operation is simple, the hardware is conditioned by the fact that due to bandwidth efficiency full raster rows must be read from the external memory, and that a row-major image scan should be performed to support shift-variant convolutions. When extending the architectures developed in prior-art to support shift-variant convolutions, we realize that they require large amounts of on-chip memory. While this fact may not have a large cost increase in ASIC implementations, it makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) implementations expensive or not feasible. In this paper, we propose several novel FPGA-efficient architectures for generating a moving window over a row-wise print path. Because the proposed concepts have different throughput and resource utilization, we provide a criteria to choose the optimum one for any design point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area-efficient 2-D shift-variant convolvers for FPGA-based digital image processing","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2005.857091","startPage":"105","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2005.857091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/33555/01593965.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1593965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1593965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Area-efficient 2-D shift-variant convolvers for FPGA-based digital image processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1593965/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8938008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-efficient 2-D shift-variant convolvers for FPGA-based digital image processing","sourcePdf":"01593965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036741S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"33555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"33555","articleId":"1593965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1593970,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These systems have the ability to incorporate very large band widths without sacrificing equalization complexity. The long symbol duration is effective at mitigating ISI, and adaptive modulation or frequency diversity can be used to provide protection against destructive fades. The benefit of MC CDMA is that it experiences frequency diversity because each bit is transmitted over several independently faded subcarriers. If some subcarriers experience destructive fades, diversity combining can be used at the receiver to recover the data. This improves the BER performance over OFDM, and this improvement is more significant as the number of subcarriers is increased. The draw back of MC-CDMA is that it may experience high levels of multiuser access interference (MAI) when the channel is heavily loaded. This occurs because each chip of the PN sequence experiences independent fading, which tends to destroy the orthogonality between spreading sequences. This increases the MAI and degrades the BER performance. Although OFDM, MC-CDMA, and MC-DS-CDMA signals experience a high PAPR, synchronization issues, and ICI, the benefits greatly outweigh these disadvantages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1594005/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8794897","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Meeting mobile's demands with multicarrier systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meeting mobile's demands with multicarrier systems","sourcePdf":"01594005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039892S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"45","isNumber":"33556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"45","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33556","articleId":"1594005","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1594027,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

In a practical OFDM system, carrier frequency offset (CFO) destroys the orthogonality among the subcarriers, and degrades the system performance. In this paper, a blind carrier frequency offset estimator (BCFOE) is proposed to identify CFO in OFDM systems. The proposed BCFOE is based on kurtosis, and can estimate CFO within the range of half subcarrier spacing. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed BCFOE outperforms existing techniques as presented in W. Chung and C. R. Johnson (2002) and Y. Yao and G. B.

Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed BCFOE.","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594055.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"130 Vol. 1","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind carrier frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems based on kurtosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Computational modeling","Training data","Delay estimation","Computational complexity","Narrowband","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","channel estimation","frequency estimation","communication complexity","blind equalisers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind carrier frequency offset estimation","kurtosis based OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless communications","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Blind carrier frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems based on kurtosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594055/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8931686","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind carrier frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems based on kurtosis","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066923S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1594057,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The architecture proposed in this paper is a parallel stream processor called neural networks stream processor or NnSP which can be programmed to realize different neural-network topologies and architectures. NnSP is a collection of programmable processing engines organized in custom FIFO-based cache architecture and busing system. Streams of synaptic data flow through the parallel processing elements, and computations are performed based on the instructions embedded in the preambles of the data streams. The command and configuration words embedded in the preamble of a stream, program each processing element to perform a desired computation on the upcoming data. The packetized nature of the stream architecture brings up a high degree of flexibility and scalability for NnSP.

This charge supply mechanism consists of two NMOS transistors in a serial connection and a feedback circuit. One of two NMOS transistors is connected to the N node of a photodiode for providing supplied charges and is controlled by the feedback circuit. The other NMOS transistor is addressed by the row-select control signal to reduce sensor's power consumption. The feedback circuit senses the pixel's output and converts it to a control signal for the operation of charge supply. A testing chip with a 128 /spl times/ 128 pixel array was fabricated by using the TSMC 0.35 /spl mu/m 2P4M CMOS technology. The measurement results demonstrate that the responses are around 25mV, 260mV and 150mV per decade of light intensity during high, middle and low luminance, respectively. The overall dynamic range could attain 120dB. With capability of using a single reset signal to read pixels, the proposed sensor is easily integrated with the correlated double sampling (CDS) circuit to effectively minimize fixed pattern noise (FPN). As compared to the conventional image sensors, the proposed image sensor would have high sensitivity under low light intensity. Moreover, the feedback circuit would automatically control the amount of supply charges during high light intensity to delay photodiode's saturation without any external control signal. Particularly, the pixel array can be partitioned into multiple sub-arrays that are addressed by different feedback circuits. The proposed image sensor can effectively increase its dynamic range and clearly sense the high contrast picture.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594118","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","startPage":"384","endPage":"387 Vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high dynamic-range CMOS image sensor with locally adjusting charge supply mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high dynamic-range CMOS image sensor with locally adjusting charge supply mechanism","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594118/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8938912","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1594118/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high dynamic-range CMOS image sensor with locally adjusting charge supply mechanism","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054684S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1594120,"authors":[{"name":"N.

By using time-multiplexing in the networks, high number of neurons and synapses can be integrated on the chip and the number of required interconnections is reduced. For training, perturbative training (Madaline Rule III) is applied, which is more robust for implementing mixed-signal designs. Training the network with node perturbation is faster, however, implementing node perturbation adds to the network complexity. In the proposed design most of the limiting factors of this training rule are solved by performing the operations in current mode and using counters. Arrays of mixed-signal multiplying-digital-to-analog-converters (MDAC) blocks are used for synaptic multiplication. A compact architecture with a more linear transfer function is used for the MDAC to reduce the area, power consumption and noise.

As a number of WPAN applications require protected communications, the standard defines security procedures. Since the procedures typically consume most processing capacity in the limited 802.15.4 devices, efficient implementations are needed. As a solution, this paper presents a compact and energy-efficient hardware design, supporting all the security suites of the standard. Compared to typical WPAN processors, the presented FPGA prototype and the estimated ASIC implementation offer significantly higher performance and lower energy consumption. The FPGA throughput at the highest security level is 90 Mb/s and the energy consumption is 1/190 of an 8-bit microcontroller and 1/5 of an ARM9. The estimated energy consumption for the equivalent ASIC implementation is 1/10 of the FPGA prototype. In addition to 802.15.4, the hardware design supports all wireless technologies derived from the IEEE 802.11i security specification.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594143","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594143.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"487 Vol. 1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation of security processing for IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594143/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation of security processing for IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8923727","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594143/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hardware implementation of security processing for IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094578S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1594148,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The ADC can be operated up to a clock sampling frequency of 8 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594157","startPage":"539","endPage":"542 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594157.pdf","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A programmable oversampling sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A programmable oversampling sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594157/","accessionNumber":"8956427","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594157/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A programmable oversampling sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039267S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1594169,"authors":[{"name":"D.C. de Souza","affiliation":["Department de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil","Department COMELEC, GET/ENST-T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, Paris, France"],"firstName":"D.C.","lastName":"de Souza","id":"37564893600"},{"name":"I.

Consequently, it is imperative to design systems that adopt leakage control techniques during both standby and active mode. In the recent past, the size of memory cores also has been increasing at a very rapid pace to cope with the demands of high computing processors. Such large memory cores will lead to significant leakage power dissipation, as most of the devices will be in a dormant or standby mode. This study addresses the static current dissipation problem in an SRAM memory core, by implementing a combinatorial approach to reduce leakage current. In this approach we have combined multiple-Vth devices, high-oxide thickness devices and dynamic Vth techniques to reduce both subthreshold and gate-oxide leakage current.

An RC filter and an NMOS transistor have been simulated as demonstration examples. The presented technique utilizes a digital signal-processing object (SPO) that is analogous to an analog operational amplifier. An array of SPOs solves nonlinear difference equations in the same way that an array of opamps solves nonlinear differential equations. The SPO is first designed in Simulink and then emulated in the Xilinx system generator. This model is then programmed onto an FPGA, Spartan-3, e.g. The simulation result is virtually identical to a standard SPICE simulation, but simulation speed is increased by more than an order of magnitude, as compared to simulations running on typical workstations. This is because a typical FPGA holds many SPOs, all running in parallel at a high clock rate. Advantages are: 1) speed of execution with little or no degradation in the accuracy, 2) no parallel programming step since the SPO interconnections are specified by the difference equations and 3) the resulting FPGA can act as a high speed attached processor to the workstation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8931698","htmlLink":"/document/1594186/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based MOS circuit simulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based MOS circuit simulator","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096122S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1594209,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

A digital background compensation technique for sample-time error in time-interleaved ADCs is proposed. This error estimation method does not use a calibration signal and is especially suitable for time-interleaved ADCs used in digital data communication systems. The error correction is performed by adjusting the delay of the clock path of each channel, using a digitally-controlled delay element. The compensation method is not sensitive to the offset mismatch among channels. However, the required gain matching among channels is provided by a gain mismatch compensation technique that is also proposed in this paper.

This paper introduces a novel idea based on a random sampling technique of inferential statistics for measurement and local correction of the duty cycle of high-speed on-chip signals. The high measurement accuracy achievable through the proposed random sampling technique provides a way to correct the duty cycle with a maximum error of less than half the smallest delay resolution unit available for correction. An input signal with duty cycle from 30% to 70% can be adjusted to a wide range of values within this range using a purely digital, area-efficient standard cell based design. Our experimental results gathered though extensive simulations of the proposed circuit manifest a very close correlation to the expected theoretical results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Circuits","Clocks","Very large scale integration","Analog-digital conversion","Synchronization","Statistics","Error correction","Delay","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","signal sampling","logic circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duty cycle measurement","duty cycle correction","random sampling technique","on-chip clock","VLSI circuit","DRAM","dynamic-domino pipelined circuit","pipelined analog-to-digital converter","serializer circuit","SERDES circuit","deserializer circuit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594283","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594283.pdf","startPage":"1043","endPage":"1046 Vol. 2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Duty cycle measurement and correction using a random sampling technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Duty cycle measurement and correction using a random sampling technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594283/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594283/","accessionNumber":"8931710","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duty cycle measurement and correction using a random sampling technique","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042143S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1594284,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

The new methodology has the potential to revolutionize the signal and image processing fields.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594286","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1058 Vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594286.pdf","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving optimized matched forward and inverse transform pairs via genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Image reconstruction","Quantization","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Testing","Signal processing","Wavelet domain","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","image reconstruction","genetic algorithms","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolved transforms","forward transforms","inverse transforms","genetic algorithm","wavelets","image compression","image reconstruction","quantization error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Evolving optimized matched forward and inverse transform pairs via genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594286/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8938931","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving optimized matched forward and inverse transform pairs via genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034932S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1594298,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

A test program often generates hundreds of thousands of different test vectors applied at a frequency of several megahertz over several hundred milliseconds. Production testers are large machines that take up their own room and are very expensive (typically well over $1 million). Either the customer, or the ASIC manufacturer, or booth, develop the test program. Two things are necessary before virtual integration and test can be accomplished. The first is the ability to simulate the hardware at speeds sufficient to make software execution a reality. In most cases, this means that the hardware simulation performance must be increased by a factor of at least 1000 over current execution speeds. The second is the need to bring the debug and development environments of the hardware and software closer together. In order to describe here the proposed method, the test of a circuit is presented. The DUT (device under test) used as example is a digital integrated circuit that implements a novel architecture for multiplication. The multiplier integrated circuit was designed using Xilinx and Mentor Graphics tools and fabricated in AMI_C5F technology.

This paper is concerned with the genetic-algorithm optimization of the corresponding combined cascade-of-resonators/cascade-of-integrators (CRI) Sigma-Delta D/A converters. The salient feature of CRI Sigma-Delta D/A converters is that the constituent signal and noise transfer functions become complimentary by the converter configuration proper, simplifying the design process to the realization of the constituent noise transfer function. Moreover, the configuration proper places the noise transfer function zeros on the unit-circle, making it possible to obtain high signal-to-quantization-noise ratios. The underlying genetic algorithm for the optimization of the noise transfer function guarantees that after the application of the operations of crossover and mutation to the parent noise transfer functions, the resulting offspring noise transfer functions are (inherently) BIBO stable. The usefulness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through its application to the design of a sixth-order lowpass CRI Sigma-Delta D/A converter employing a 64 time oversampling ratio for a final realization incorporating 16-bit multiplier values","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594313","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594313.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1166 Vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and optimization of a class of oversampled sigma-delta D/A converters by employing genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of a class of oversampled sigma-delta D/A converters by employing genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8967439","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1594313/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of a class of oversampled sigma-delta D/A converters by employing genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045466S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1594315,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The logic part of any multitechnology system can be implemented in the programmable block and multitechnology components can be incorporated from different multitechnology blocks available in the library. This paper describes the incorporation of a multitechnology block (MTB) in the new MT-FPGA architecture to underline the multitechnology field programmable ability of this architecture. The MTB is designed for implementation using 0.25 deep submicron technologies and consists of a p-diffusion to n-well photodetector followed by a sampling circuit and a buffer amplifier. The sampling rate of the MTB can be adjusted for different range of optical powers level thus giving the facility to represent wide range of optical power within the 2.5V range.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594345","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594345.pdf","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1293 Vol. 2","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pixel scale optical sample and hold circuit integrated with multitechnology FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Pixel scale optical sample and hold circuit integrated with multitechnology FPGA","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1594345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8931724","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixel scale optical sample and hold circuit integrated with multitechnology FPGA","confLoc":"Covington, KY","sourcePdf":"01594345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055517S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1594363,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

Simulations show an 88% reduction in standby gate leakage using Berkeley predictive technology models (BPTM) of 65nm with no performance degradation over standard domino circuits. Simulations also show that the proposed technique is 17% more robust against loading variations compared to previously proposed leakage reduction techniques.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594370","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1393 Vol. 2","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On gate leakage reduction in dynamic CMOS circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gate leakage","CMOS technology","Degradation","Power dissipation","Predictive models","Circuit simulation","Transistors","Leakage current","Circuit noise","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit modelling","leakage currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate leakage reduction","leakage reduction circuit","standby gate leakage","domino dynamic CMOS circuits","Berkeley predictive technology models","domino circuits","65 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On gate leakage reduction in dynamic CMOS circuits","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8931731","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1594370/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594370/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On gate leakage reduction in dynamic CMOS circuits","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053764S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1594371,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan Zhou","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA"],"lastName":"Kuan Zhou","id":"37330232100"},{"name":"Sizhong Chen","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Sizhong Chen","id":"37277600900"},{"name":"A.

A look-ahead self-timed Tr-MCML pipeline architecture is designed to realize the data-driven power-on-demand operation to reduce the static power consumption while maintaining the high-speed property of MCML. This design approach is particularly desirable for latency-critical digital systems that solely rely on high-speed circuit design to improve performance.

This enables the BPD to generate 1 context/clock-cycle for non-empty stripe-columns without stalling to load a new stripe-column. Further we propose speculative technique to improve the operating frequency of our architecture at the expense of extra hardware. The proposed BPD is implemented on an Altera Stratix FPGA. The implementation results show that the proposed architectures yield 50.1-107.1% increase in throughput with only a 27-37% increase in the hardware cost.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594381","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1437 Vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594381.pdf","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The high throughput bit plane decoder for JPEG2000 based on selective sample skipping algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"The high throughput bit plane decoder for JPEG2000 based on selective sample skipping algorithm","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594381/","accessionNumber":"8931736","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594381/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The high throughput bit plane decoder for JPEG2000 based on selective sample skipping algorithm","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035456S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1594382,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

While numerous approaches working at the structural level have been reported, techniques targeted at higher levels are less common.

In this paper, we introduce a first approach towards a functionally-aware methodology that could provide improved results for the high-level partitioning of DSTs to DHAs. Our methodology has been devised through the study of DST partitioning techniques for DHA-similar systems, as well as general DST formulation techniques.

Redundant wavelet transform (RDWT) conquers the \"shift-variant\" problem in DWT and enables the motion estimation and motion compensation (ME/MC) in wavelet domain. Also, RDWT produces growing number of phases at each level of the transform, each phase contributes to the ME/MC procedure by providing a unique hypothesis. Based on the previous successful usage of phase-diversity multihypothesis in redundant wavelet transform domain, this paper presents a technique to combine the spatial-diversity multihypothesis with the transform domain multihypothesis. We take the overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) as one example from spatial domain multihypothesis. Experiment results show that the combination of the two classes of multihypothesis outperforms either method implemented alone. Furthermore, choose different subbands for OBMC in order to simplify the system is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594409.pdf","startPage":"1545","endPage":"1548 Vol. 2","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining phase-diversity with spatial-diversity multihypothesis motion compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Video coding","Wavelet domain","Motion estimation","Decorrelation","Discrete transforms","Data engineering","Wavelet transforms","Data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","motion compensation","motion estimation","data compression","discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-diversity","spatial-diversity","multihypothesis motion compensation","discrete wavelet transform","data compression","redundant wavelet transform","shift-variant problem","motion estimation","wavelet domain","transform domain multihypothesis","overlapped block motion compensation","spatial domain multihypothesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Combining phase-diversity with spatial-diversity multihypothesis motion compensation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594409/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8931744","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining phase-diversity with spatial-diversity multihypothesis motion compensation","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040895S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1594412,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although a GA is able to find very good solutions for a variety of applications, it typically requires many computations and iterations to be effective, and the amount of time consumed by these computations and iterations is enormous. Thus, software implementations of GAs applied to increasingly complex problems and large search spaces can cause unacceptable delays. An alternative to this approach is the hardware implementation of GAs in order to achieve tremendous speedup over software counterparts by exploiting the inherent parallelism of the GA paradigm.

Spike-time dependent plasticity can support coding schemes that are based on spatio-temporal spike patterns. Spiking (or pulsed) neural networks (SNNs) are models which explicitly take into account the timing of inputs. The network input and output are usually represented as series of spikes (delta function or more complex shapes). Plasticity SNNs have an advantage of being able to recurrently process information. Spike-time dependent plasticity can enhance signal transmission by selectively strengthening synaptic connections that transmit precisely timed spikes at the expense of those synapses that transmit poorly timed spikes. Complete theory describes the spiking network's digital implementation. Theory is verified using simulation of a biologically plausible odor environment with 1023 odor receptor inputs. Stochastic on-chip learning uses sampling and a correlation filter to learn odors despite noisy environment conditions. Simulation and Verilog chip design are tested on a field programmable gate array.

In this paper, we introduce a new multi-layer substrate modeling technique for spiral inductors based on complex image theory. Our substrate modeling approach combines explicit closed-form expressions with techniques that exploit the spiral inductor's geometry. The new approach provides up to 5 orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods using field solvers while providing an average error of 0.1% for inductance and 3.9% for resistance over a wide range of inductor geometries and substrate configurations. Due to its speed, our technique provides a practical substrate modeling solution for rapid inductor automated synthesis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eddy currents","Spirals","Inductors","Design automation","Geometry","Solid modeling","Space exploration","Closed-form solution","Inductance","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["substrates","eddy currents","inductors","electronic design automation","inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["substrate eddy current modeling","integrated spiral inductor design automation","multilayer substrate modeling","complex image theory","closed-form expressions","inductor geometries","substrate configurations","rapid inductor automated synthesis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594477","publicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10622/33557/01594477.pdf","startPage":"1823","endPage":"1826 Vol. 2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient modeling of substrate eddy currents for integrated spiral inductor design automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient modeling of substrate eddy currents for integrated spiral inductor design automation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594477/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594477/","accessionNumber":"8931763","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient modeling of substrate eddy currents for integrated spiral inductor design automation","confLoc":"Covington, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"01594477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039195S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10622","isNumber":"33557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10622","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"33557","articleId":"1594477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1594491,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Although FSBMA gives an optimal solution and low control overhead, its hardware implementation will not be feasible in terms of power dissipation, speed of processing, compression ratio and real estate. In FSBMA, for a 16/spl times/16 block, with a search range of -p to p, totally (2p+1)/sup 2/ number of candidate blocks are to be searched. In this paper, we have constructed an N-queen lattice of candidate blocks, to characterize spatial information in all directions. This arrangement reduces the number of candidate blocks to be searched to 5(2p+1). The total computational complexity is found to be reduced to 7.35% compared to FSBMA. The loss in SNR is very negligible and at the worst case comes to an average of less than 0.23 dB in both low motion and medium motion video sequences.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Image coding","Video sequences","Video compression","Bit rate","Redundancy","Sampling methods","Optimal control","Hardware","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","image sequences","image sampling","image matching","video coding","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","candidate block selection","spatial pixel subsampling algorithm","N-queen lattice","computational complexity","block matching method","SNR","video sequences"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IST.2005.1594544","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Imaging Systems and Techniques, 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Imaging Systems and Techniques, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10625/33559/01594544.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST.2005.1594544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion estimation with candidate block and pixel subsampling algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion estimation with candidate block and pixel subsampling algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594544/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594544/","accessionNumber":"8874743","conferenceDate":"13-13 May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13 May 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion estimation with candidate block and pixel subsampling algorithm","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01594544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045936S","chronDate":"13 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10625","isNumber":"33559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10625","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33559","articleId":"1594544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1594641,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Bus matrix based communication architectures consist of several parallel buses which provide a suitable backbone to support high bandwidth systems, but suffer from high cost overhead due to extensive bus wiring inside the matrix. Manual traversal of the vast exploration space to synthesize a minimal cost bus matrix that also satisfies performance constraints is practically infeasible. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an automated approach for synthesizing a bus matrix communication architecture which satisfies all performance constraints in the design and minimizes wire congestion in the matrix. To validate our approach, we consider several industrial strength applications from the networking domain and show that our approach results in up to 9times component savings when compared to a full bus matrix and up to 3.2times savings when compared to a maximally connected reduced bus matrix","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10626/33561/01594641.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","publicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraint-driven bus matrix synthesis for MPSoC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Bandwidth","Costs","Network-on-a-chip","System-on-a-chip","Computer architecture","Space exploration","Network synthesis","Wire","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","system buses","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bus matrix synthesis","multiprocessor system-on-chip","MPSoC design","bus matrix communication architecture","bus wiring","wire congestion matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Constraint-driven bus matrix synthesis for MPSoC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594641/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8912774","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint-driven bus matrix synthesis for MPSoC","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"01594641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060851S","chronDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10626","isNumber":"33561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10626","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"33561","articleId":"1594641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1594644,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

To be cost effective, SoCs are often programmable and integrate several different applications or use-cases on to the same chip.

In this work we motivate the need to consider multiple use-cases during the NoC design process. We present a method to efficiently map the applications on to the NoC architecture, satisfying the design constraints of each individual use-case. We also present novel ways to dynamically reconfigure the network across the different use-cases and explore the possibility of integrating dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVS/DFS) techniques with the use-case centric NoC design methodology.

In the short term, such a network will provide scalable chip-wide communication and ease the complexity of handling multi-cycle communications. In the long term, the network will become a primary tool for optimising power and data transfers and for scheduling computations. This paper details the design and implementation of a low-latency on-chip network. The network's speculative routers are in the best case able to route flits in a single clock cycle, helping to minimise on-chip communication latencies and maximise the effectiveness of buffering resources. Results from our 180nm test chip demonstrate an inter-router data transfer rate in excess of 16Gbit/s for each link.

Although several algorithms have been proposed for mixed-sized placements, most of them primarily focus on the global placement aspect. In this paper we propose a three-step approach, named XDP, for mixed-size detailed placement. First, a combination of constraint graph and linear programming is used to legalize macros. Then, an enhanced greedy method is used to legalize the standard cells. Finally, a sliding-window-based cell swapping is applied to further reduce wirelength. The impact of individual techniques is analyzed and quantified. Experiments show that when applied to the set of global placement results generated by APlace (Kahng and Wang, 2004), XDP can produce wirelength comparable to the native detailed placement of APlace, and 3% shorter wire-length compared to Fengshui 5.0 (Agnitori et al., 2005). When applied to the set of global placements generated by mPL6 (Chan et al., 2005), XDP is the only detailed placement that successfully produces legal placement for all the examples, while APlace and Fengshui fail for 4/9 and 1/3 of the examples. For cases where legal placements can be compared, the wirelength produced by XDP is shorter by 3% on average compared to APlace and Fengshui. Furthermore, XDP displays a higher robustness than the other tools by covering a broader spectrum of examples by different global placement tools.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594680","publicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10626/33561/01594680.pdf","startPage":"7 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust detailed placement for mixed-size IC designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust detailed placement for mixed-size IC designs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","accessionNumber":"8894595","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594680/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594680/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust detailed placement for mixed-size IC designs","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"01594680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128076S","chronDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10626","isNumber":"33561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10626","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33561","articleId":"1594680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1594681,"authors":[{"name":"N.

One of the most important characteristics of flip-chip designs is that the input/output buffers could be placed anywhere inside a chip. In this paper, we first introduce the floorplanning problem for the flip-chip design and formulate it as assigning the positions of input/output buffers and first-stage/last-stage blocks so that the path length between blocks and bump balls as well as the delay skew of the paths are simultaneously minimized. We then present a hierarchical method to solve the problem. We first cluster a block and its corresponding buffers to reduce the problem size. Then, we go into iterations of the alternating and interacting global optimization step and the partitioning step. The global optimization step places blocks based on simulated annealing using the B*-tree representation to minimize a given cost function. The partitioning step dissects the chip into two subregions, and the blocks are divided into two groups and are placed in respective subregions. The two steps repeat until each subregion contains at most a given number of blocks, defined by the ratio of the total block area to the chip area. At last, we refine the floorplan by perturbing blocks inside a subregion as well as in different subregions.

Our approach extends and applies recently-developed computational methods for macromodel ling electrical oscillators, and features both phase and amplitude components that are extracted automatically (using numerical algorithms) from more complex differential-equation oscillator models available in the literature. We apply our approach to networks of tunneling phase logic (TPL) and Brusselator biochemical oscillators, predicting a variety of spontaneous pattern generation phenomena. Comparing our results with published measurements of spiral, circular and other pattern formation, we show that we can predict these phenomena correctly, and also demonstrate that prior models (like Kuramoto's) cannot do so.

A well known and highly recommended method to improve via yield/reliability is to add redundant vias. In this paper, we study the problem of post-routing redundant via insertion and formulate it as a maximum independent set (MIS) problem. We present an efficient graph construction algorithm to model the problem, and an effective MIS heuristic to solve the problem. The experimental results show that our MIS heuristic inserts more redundant vias and distributes them more uniformly among via layers than a commercial tool and an existing method. The number of inserted redundant vias can be increased by up to 21.24%. Besides, since redundant vias can be classified into on-track and off-track ones, and on-track ones have better electrical properties, we also present two methods (one is modified from the MIS heuristic, and the other is applied as a post processor) to increase the amount of on-track redundant vias. The experimental results indicate that both methods perform very well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-routing redundant via insertion for yield/reliability improvement","publicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594699","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10626/33561/01594699.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Post-routing redundant via insertion for yield/reliability improvement","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594699/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8894599","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-routing redundant via insertion for yield/reliability improvement","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"01594699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122768S","chronDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10626","isNumber":"33561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10626","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33561","articleId":"1594699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1594700,"authors":[{"name":"Tianpei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA"],"lastName":"Tianpei Zhang","id":"37273953700"},{"name":"Yong Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA"],"lastName":"Yong Zhan","id":"37267569900"},{"name":"S.S.

In this paper, we propose a temperature-aware 3D global routing algorithm with insertion of \"thermal vias\" and \"thermal wires\" to lower the effective thermal resistance of the material, thereby reducing chip temperature. Since thermal vias and thermal wires take up lateral routing space, our algorithm utilizes sensitivity analysis to judiciously allocate their usage, and iteratively resolve contention between routing and thermal vias and thermal wires. Experimental results show that our routing algorithm can effectively reduce the peak temperature and alleviate routing congestion.","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10626/33561/01594700.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","publicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature-aware routing in 3D ICs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Thermal resistance","Iterative algorithms","Wires","Temperature sensors","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Circuit optimization","Electrothermal effects","Design methodology","Sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit layout","network routing","thermal analysis","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature-aware routing","3D integrated circuits","electrothermal design methodology","3D global routing algorithm","thermal vias","thermal wires","thermal resistance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Temperature-aware routing in 3D ICs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594700/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8894600","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-aware routing in 3D ICs","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"01594700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081053S","chronDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10626","isNumber":"33561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10626","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"33561","articleId":"1594700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1594714,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Our approach focuses on reconfiguration delay overhead and placement-related issues (such as fragmentation) while selecting individual data-parallelism granularity as an integral part of simultaneous scheduling and placement. We demonstrate that our heuristic generates high-quality schedules on an extensive set of over a 1000 synthetic experiments by comparing the results with an approach that tries to statically maximize data-parallelism, i.e., does not consider the overheads and constraints associated with partial RTR.

Gate sizing has emerged as one of the efficient way to subside the yield deterioration due to manufacturing variations. In the past single-objective optimization techniques have been used to optimize the timing variation whereas on the other hand multi-objective optimization techniques can provide a more promising approach to design the circuit. We propose a new algorithm called YOGA, based on multi-objective optimization technique called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA). YOGA optimizes a circuit in multi domains and provides the user with Pareto-optimal set of solutions which are distributed all over the optimal design spectrum, giving users the flexibility to choose the best fitting solution for their requirements. YOGA overcomes the disadvantages of traditional optimization techniques, while even providing solutions in very stringent bounds","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594771","startPage":"6 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10626/33561/01594771.pdf","publicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yield-area optimizations of digital circuits using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (YOGA)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital circuits","Sorting","Genetic algorithms","Timing","Design optimization","Uncertainty","Constraint optimization","Genetic engineering","Reliability engineering","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","digital integrated circuits","genetic algorithms","integrated circuit yield","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["yield-area optimizations","digital integrated circuits","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm","YOGA","gate sizing","single-objective optimization techniques","multi-objective optimization techniques","NSGA","optimal design spectrum","Pareto optimisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Yield-area optimizations of digital circuits using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (YOGA)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594771/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8912859","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yield-area optimizations of digital circuits using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (YOGA)","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"01594771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052421S","chronDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10626","isNumber":"33561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10626","xplore-issue":"33561","articleId":"1594771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1594776,"authors":[{"name":"Tung-Chien Chen","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering,  Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tung-Chien Chen","id":"37276681700"},{"name":"Chung-Jr Lian","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering,  Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Jr Lian","id":"37267480800"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering,  Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9451-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"1594776","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":607},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Automatic voltage control","Video codecs","Bandwidth","Pipeline processing","Computer architecture","Video coding","Design optimization","Code standards","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","motion compensation","motion estimation","pipeline processing","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architecture design","H.264/AVC video codec","video coding standard","motion compensation engine","reconfigurable intra predictor generator","parallel integer motion estimation","hybrid task pipelining scheme","block-level pipelining","MB-level pipelining","frame-level pipelining","bandwidth reduction techniques","data reused schemes"]}],"abstract":"H.264/AVC is the latest video coding standard. It significantly outperforms the previous video coding standards, but the extraordinary huge computation complexity and memory access requirement make the hardwired codec solution a tough job.

The design consideration and optimization for its significant modules including bandwidth optimized motion compensation engine, reconfigurable intra predictor generator, low bandwidth parallel integer motion estimation are mentioned. Due to the complex, sequential, and highly data-depended characteristics of all essential algorithms in H.264/AVC, not only the pipeline structure but also efficient memory hierarchy is required. The design case with a hybrid task pipelining scheme, a balanced schedule with block-level, MB-level, and frame-level pipelining, are presented.

Key features of this methodology are broad optimization with fast rule-based analysis engines using macro-level abstraction for constraints propagation up/down the design hierarchy, coupled with accurate transistor level simulation for detailed analysis. The methodology fostered the modular design concept that is inherent to the CELL architecture, enabling a high frequency design by maximizing custom circuit content through re-use, and balanced power, frequency, and die size targets through global convergence capabilities. The design has roughly 241 million transistors implemented in 90 nm SOI technology with 8 levels of copper interconnects and one local interconnect layer.

Correct operation has been observed in the lab on first pass silicon at frequencies well over 4GHz.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33561","startPage":"8 pp.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10626/33561/01594796.pdf","publicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"Asia and South Pacific Conference on Design Automation, 2006.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2006.1594796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Key features of the design methodology enabling a multi-core SoC implementation of a first-generation CELL processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Frequency","Integrated circuit interconnections","Constraint optimization","Design optimization","Engines","Coupling circuits","Analytical models","Circuit simulation","Copper"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip","microprocessor chips","knowledge based systems","circuit simulation","silicon-on-insulator","silicon","copper"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-core SoC implementation","first-generation CELL processor","Giga-scale system integration","rule-based analysis engine","macro-level abstraction","constraints propagation","transistor level simulation","high frequency design","SOI technology","copper interconnect","4 GHz","90 nm","Si","Cu"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Key features of the design methodology enabling a multi-core SoC implementation of a first-generation CELL processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594796/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594796/","accessionNumber":"8894632","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key features of the design methodology enabling a multi-core SoC implementation of a first-generation CELL processor","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"01594796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066267S","chronDate":"24-27 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10626","isNumber":"33561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10626","xplore-issue":"33561","articleId":"1594796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1594848,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Most of the current algorithms use a statistically predefined threshold as an input parameter for biclustering. This threshold defines the maximum allowable dissimilarity between the cells of a bicluster and is very hard to determine beforehand. Hence we propose two genetic algorithms that embed greedy algorithm as local search procedure and find the best biclusters independent of this threshold score. We also establish that the HScore of a bicluster under the additive model approximately follows chi-square distribution.

The algorithm used to construct those codes was an evolutionary algorithm with a fitness function with exponential time complexity. Presented here is an substantially faster evolutionary algorithm for locating error correcting codes over the edit metric that exhibits either equivalent or only slightly inferior performance on test cases. The new algorithm can produce codes for parameters where the run-time of the earlier algorithm was prohibitive. The new algorithm is a novel type of evolutionary algorithm using a greedy algorithm to implement a variation operator. This variation operator is the sole variation operator used and has unary, binary, and k-ary forms. The unary and binary forms are compared, with the binary form being found superior. Population size and the rate of introduction of random material by the variation operator are also studied. A high rate of introduction of random material and a small population size are found to be the best.","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/10629/33563/01594898.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Variation Operator for More Rapid Evolution of DNA Error Correcting Codes.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2005.1594898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2005.1594898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Variation Operator for More Rapid Evolution of DNA Error Correcting Codes.","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1594898/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Variation Operator for More Rapid Evolution of DNA Error Correcting Codes.","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01594898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046436S","chronDate":"14-15 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10629","isNumber":"33563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10629","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33563","articleId":"1594898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1594904,"authors":[{"name":"C.B.

The algorithm computes the maximum score of alignments that use insertions, deletions, and substitutions, with no consideration given in composition of the alignments. However, biologists favor applying their knowledge about common structures or functions into the alignment process. For alignment of protein sequences, several methods have been suggested for taking into account the motifs (a restricted regular expression) from the PROSITE database to guide alignments. One method modifies the Smith Waterman dynamic programming solution to reward alignments that contain matching motifs. Another method introduces the regular expression constrained sequence alignment problem in which pairwise alignments are constrained to contain a given regular expression. This latter method constructs a weighted finite automaton from a given regular expression, and presents a dynamic programming solution that simulates copies of this automaton in seeking an alignment with maximum score containing the regular expression. We generalize this approach: 1) We introduce a variation of the problem for multiple sequences, namely the regular expression constrained multiple sequence alignment, and present an algorithm for it; 2) We develop an algorithm for the case of the problem when the alignments sought are required to contain a given sequence of regular expressions.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2005.1594922","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/10629/33563/01594922.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2005.1594922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Sequence Alignment Containing a Sequence of Regular Expressions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594922/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Sequence Alignment Containing a Sequence of Regular Expressions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594922/","conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Sequence Alignment Containing a Sequence of Regular Expressions","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01594922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054806S","chronDate":"14-15 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10629","isNumber":"33563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10629","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33563","articleId":"1594922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1594934,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlong Liu","affiliation":["Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Yunlong Liu","id":"37087071788"},{"name":"H.

The formulation of the forward and backward variables in profile HMMs is made under statistical independence assumption of the probability theory. We propose a fuzzy profile hidden Markov model to overcome the limitations of the statistical independence assumption of probability theory. The strong correlations and the sequence preference involved in the protein structures make fuzzy architecture based models as suitable candidates for building profiles of a given family since fuzzy set can handle uncertainties better than classical methods. The proposed model fuzzifies the forward and backward variables by incorporating Sugeno fuzzy measures using Choquet integrals which is extended to fuzzy Baum-Welch parameter estimation algorithm for profiles. It was built and tested on widely studied globin and kinase family sequences and its performance was compared with classical HMM. A comparative analysis based on Log-Likelihood (LL) scores of sequences and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) demonstrates the superiority of fuzzy profile HMMs over the classical profile model.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2005.1594950","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/10629/33563/01594950.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2005.1594950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Profile Hidden Markov Models for Protein Sequence Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1594950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1594950/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Profile Hidden Markov Models for Protein Sequence Analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1594950/","conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Profile Hidden Markov Models for Protein Sequence Analysis","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01594950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088367S","chronDate":"14-15 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10629","isNumber":"33563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10629","xplore-issue":"33563","articleId":"1594950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1594952,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The algorithm allows one to fulfil a contradictory paradigm in term of FKB precision and simplicity (high precision generally translates into high complexity level) considering a randomly generated population of potential FKBs. The RBLGA is divided in two principal coding ways: 1) a real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) that maps the fuzzy sets repartition and number (which drives the number of fuzzy rules) into a set of real numbers and. 2) a binary like aenetic algorithm that deals with the fuzzy rule base (a set of integer numbers). The RBLGA uses three reproduction mechanisms, a BLX-\u03b1, a simple crossover and a fuzzy set reducer. The RBLGA is validated through a theoretical surface and, funally, applied to a set of experimental data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595133/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595133/","publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real/Binary-Like Coded Genetic Algorithm to Automatically Generate Fuzzy Knowledge Bases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real/Binary-Like Coded Genetic Algorithm to Automatically Generate Fuzzy Knowledge Bases","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01595133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066376S","chronDate":"12-12 June 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10630","isNumber":"33564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10630","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33564","articleId":"1595133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1595155,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) Lab, Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Hao Li","id":"37087151443"},{"name":"S.X.

However, under the situation of block data symbol length is smaller than the channel order, if the decomposed ZF equalizer is with the same order as the unified ZF equalizer, the performance improvement could be achieved, significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595401","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10632/33566/01595401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33566","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel decomposed FIR zero-forcing filterbanks equalizer for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel decomposed FIR zero-forcing filterbanks equalizer for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595401/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8893576","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1595401/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel decomposed FIR zero-forcing filterbanks equalizer for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01595401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054734S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10632","isNumber":"33566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10632","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33566","articleId":"1595401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1595403,"authors":[{"name":"Miin-Jong Hao","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Miin-Jong Hao","id":"37417911800"},{"name":"Kao-Hsiung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kao-Hsiung Lee","id":"37966724800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9266-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1595403","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Transmitters","System performance","OFDM modulation","Interference","Frequency estimation","Bit error rate","Local oscillators","Degradation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ICI self-cancellation scheme","intercarrier interference","recursive multistep ICI","carrier-to-interference ratio","bit error rates","OFDM receivers"]}],"abstract":"For OFDM systems, the carrier frequency offsets will ruin the orthogonality among subcarriers and hence result in intercarrier interference (ICI).

In this paper, we present a novel FRUC technique based on the motion compensated interpolation with multi-size blocks. At first, the frame image is divided into 8/spl times/8 blocks and motion vectors are estimated for each 8/spl times/8 block. Next, the similar motion blocks are merged into one block.

The proposed architecture maps well onto a chain of highly pipelineable processing elements (PE) based on multiply-accumulation units with in-built ROMs. It is thus well suited for VLSI implementation, either in algorithm-specific ASIC or reconfigurable FPGA for Gabor filtering, which is one of the widespread feature extraction techniques for face processing applications such as face tracking and face recognition. Depending on the number of facial feature points (FFP) at which the Gabor jets are to be computed as well as the number of scales and orientations of the constituent Gabor filters, the number of PEs can be scaled and matched to suit the processing requirements, without sacrificing on the computational latency. Due to the regular data flow and modular structure, the linear array of PEs performing Gabor jet computations can achieve 100% hardware utilization and provide sustained throughput to match the real-time video frame rate. This VLSI architecture is mainly targeted for incorporation into a hardware implementation of dynamic face tracking system (DFTS) based on Gabor wavelets. The computation of Gabor jets is a compute-intensive task.

With this formulation, a new blind fully space-time Rake multiuser detector based on the min/max criterion is devised, and implemented with the conventional linearly constrained least squares (LC-LS) and the sliding window LC-LS (SW-LC-LS) algorithms.

The simulation indicates the mean square error (MSE) of the recovery and the convergence rate with the preprocess concept is much better and faster than that without preprocess concept.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Equations","Convergence","Iterative methods","Bandwidth","Fast Fourier transforms","Speech processing","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","discrete Fourier transforms","mean square error methods","speech processing","voice communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restoring lost samples","boundary matched","iterative algorithm","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm","mean square error","MSE","speech transmission","speech processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595472","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10632/33566/01595472.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoring lost samples with boundary matched","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Restoring lost samples with boundary matched","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595472/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595472/","accessionNumber":"8893627","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoring lost samples with boundary matched","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01595472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038301S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10632","isNumber":"33566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10632","xplore-issue":"33566","articleId":"1595472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1595483,"authors":[{"name":"Huaiyu Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NC State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Huaiyu Dai","id":"37335980600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9266-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1595483","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"abstract":"Shadow fading is generally not explicitly studied for MIMO systems.

The performance of coherent MIMO-OFDM based systems critically depends on the availability of accurate channel estimations. Preambles, at the beginning of each packet, are used to estimate the channels in IEEE 802.11n systems. However, in mobile communication, when the channel is time varying, the channel variations within a given packet increases the packet error rate (PER) in the system. So the channel variations have to be tracked by the receiver. This paper proposes a low complexity channel tracking scheme for 802.11n systems to improve the PER. The delay introduced by the channel tracking scheme is within the acceptable limits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity decision directed channel tracking for MIMO WLAN system","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595488","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10632/33566/01595488.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity decision directed channel tracking for MIMO WLAN system","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595488/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8893639","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity decision directed channel tracking for MIMO WLAN system","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01595488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035859S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10632","isNumber":"33566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10632","xplore-issue":"33566","articleId":"1595488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1595500,"authors":[{"name":"Tai-Chiu Hsung","affiliation":["Centre for Multimedia Signal Processing, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tai-Chiu Hsung","id":"37270744200"},{"name":"Yu-Hing Shum","affiliation":["Department of Electronic & Information Engineering, Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yu-Hing Shum","id":"37297200100"},{"name":"D.P.-K.

Balanced multiwavelets solve this problem by making the filters longer. By using linear phase filter banks, we propose a simple design algorithm of orthogonal symmetric prefilter banks for discrete multiwavelet that are critically sampled and can preserve approximation power. This keeps the overall system as compact as possible. The resulted systems give better performance as compared with using non-linear phase prefilters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10632/33566/01595500.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal symmetric prefilter banks for discrete multiwavelet transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete transforms","Filter bank","Digital signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Image coding","System testing","Design engineering","Signal design","Digital communication","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal symmetric prefilter banks","discrete multiwavelet transforms","scalar signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal symmetric prefilter banks for discrete multiwavelet transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8902124","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal symmetric prefilter banks for discrete multiwavelet transforms","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01595500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077218S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10632","isNumber":"33566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10632","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33566","articleId":"1595500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1595501,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

In OFDM system, the frequency domain equalizer is used in order to compensate the signal degradation by a multipath. However, the estimation accuracy of channel response is deteriorated by the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In order to solve the problem, we propose the noise canceling system based on an adaptive filter. An OFDM signal is periodic with a period of fast Fourier transform (FFT). Therefore, the current OFDM signal has high correlation with the signal shifted by the period of FFT. On the other hand, the current AWGN is not correlated with the AWGN shifted by the period of FFT. In the proposed system, the AWGN is canceled by taking advantage of the difference between the autocorrelation of the OFDM signal and the autocorrelation of the AWGN.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on noise canceling system based on adaptive filter for OFDM system","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595505","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10632/33566/01595505.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2005.1595505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A study on noise canceling system based on adaptive filter for OFDM system","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595505/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8902126","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on noise canceling system based on adaptive filter for OFDM system","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01595505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054244S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10632","isNumber":"33566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10632","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33566","articleId":"1595505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1595565,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The adaptive capability of filters is known to be increased by incorporating a neural network into the filtering procedure. The proposed algorithm is implemented with two second-order Gaussian filters based on the current statistical model and a multilayer feedforward neural network. The two filters, which use the noise corrupted measurements of the target line of sight (LOS) angle, track the same maneuvering target in parallel. The neural network automatically considers all the state information of the two filters and adaptively adjusts the process variance of one of them to achieve better performance in different target maneuver tracking. Simulations results clearly show that the proposed adaptive algorithm tracks maneuvering targets very well with higher precision over a wide range of maneuvers.","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2005.1595595","startPage":"295","endPage":"300","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2005.1595595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33567","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10633/33567/01595595.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Aided Target Tracking Algorithm Using Angular Measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595595/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Aided Target Tracking Algorithm Using Angular Measurements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595595/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Aided Target Tracking Algorithm Using Angular Measurements","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"01595595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050785S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10633","isNumber":"33567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10633","xplore-issue":"33567","articleId":"1595595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1595599,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

However, IP quality issues in terms of inadequate test coverage, low power capability, absence of functional features etc. has led to reduced benefits from reuse. This is because the IP is usually designed for use in one chip and later on (re)used in chips having different requirements. Hence, part of SoC design productivity is spent in enhancing the IP to the desired quality level. As updated versions of the IP may be released several times during the SoC design phase, managing the design database poses challenge with respect to the IP enhancements. In this paper, we describe the methodology that we successfully followed in our SoC design. It consists of enhancing the IPs for meeting the desired goals, validating the changes and controlling its version in the design database. It is required to integrate three mission critical IPs developed by the customer. Certain modifications to the customer IPs were called for to meet SoC design goals and obtain a better quality of implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/10634/33568/01595655.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2005.1595655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2005.1595655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective IP Reuse Methodology for Quality System-on-Chip Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Productivity","Databases","Time to market","Testing","Signal design","Digital signal processing","Instruments","Intellectual property","Mission critical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial property","logic design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design database","time-to-market goal","design quality","SoC design productivity","System-on-a-Chip design","intellectual property reuse","quality system-on-chip design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An Effective IP Reuse Methodology for Quality System-on-Chip Design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595655/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9608065","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective IP Reuse Methodology for Quality System-on-Chip Design","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"01595655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069163S","chronDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10634","isNumber":"33568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10634","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33568","articleId":"1595655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1595656,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Our solution is a well-defined modeling approach, known as TUT-profile, for UML 2.0 together with our system-on-chip architecture exploration tools. The two major novel features are an explicit control of real-time constraints at UML level and the transformation of the original UML model using back-annotated results of SoC architecture exploration. In this way, all information is kept up to date in a single UML model, in contrary to other flows that use UML only as a front end. This paper focuses on the interface between UML model and the architecture exploration and presents conversions, tools, and intermediate format required for the flow.","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2005.1595656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2005.1595656","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/10634/33568/01595656.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interfacing UML 2.0 for Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Design Flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Interfacing UML 2.0 for Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Design Flow","conferenceDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595656/","accessionNumber":"9608066","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595656/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interfacing UML 2.0 for Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Design Flow","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"01595656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052585S","chronDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10634","isNumber":"33568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10634","xplore-issue":"33568","articleId":"1595656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1595664,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The relationship found between input times and the resulting output times is dependent on accurate measurement of input time distributions with deviations of less than 10 ps. We show how the distribution of D to clock times at the input can be characterized in the presence of noise, and how predictions of failure rates for long synchronizer times can be made.

The proposed on-chip interface not only handles the resynchronization between the synchronous and asynchronous NoC domains, but also implements NoC communication priorities. This design is based on existing multi-clock synchronization fifos based on Gray code, and is adapted to standard implementation tools. Concerning Off-chip communications, a new concept of mixed synchronous/asynchronous dual mode NoC port is proposed as an efficient off-chip NoC interface for NoC-based open-platform prototyping.

One of this flaws is the discovery of Web services through common methods. Research has been pursued in the field of \"semantic Web services\". This research is driven by the idea, to describe the functionality of Web services as accurately as possible and to create programs automatically out of already existing Web services. In this paper we discuss a new method for discovery and analysis of Web services. Our approach uses a vector space search engine to index descriptions of already composed services. Rather than generating or automatically composing applications, this approach provides developers with a valuable utility to browse repositories based on already existing information. Furthermore, we propose some additional modifications to extract the maximum amount of semantics from existing service definition repositories.","doi":"10.1109/ECOWS.2005.5","publicationTitle":"Third European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Third European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10636/33570/01595717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECOWS.2005.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33570","startPage":"9 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vector space search engine for Web services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A vector space search engine for Web services","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595717/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8836116","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1595717/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector space search engine for Web services","confLoc":"Vaxjo, Sweden","sourcePdf":"01595717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056999S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10636","isNumber":"33570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10636","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"33570","articleId":"1595717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1595779,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The algorithm is derived for networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons, but it can be also applied to generic spiking neural networks. Learning is achieved by synaptic changes that depend on the firing of pre- and postsynaptic neurons, and that are modulated with a global reinforcement signal. The efficacy of the algorithm is verified in a biologically-inspired experiment, featuring a simulated worm that searches for food. Our model recovers a form of neural plasticity experimentally observed in animals, combining spike-timing-dependent synaptic changes of one sign with non-associative synaptic changes of the opposite sign determined by presynaptic spikes. The model also predicts that the time constant of spike-timing-dependent synaptic changes is equal to the membrane time constant of the neuron, in agreement with experimental observations in the brain. This study also led to the discovery of a biologically-plausible reinforcement learning mechanism that works by modulating spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a global reward signal.","doi":"10.1109/SYNASC.2005.13","startPage":"8 pp.","publicationTitle":"Seventh International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYNASC.2005.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33573","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10639/33573/01595864.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reinforcement learning algorithm for spiking neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595864/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A reinforcement learning algorithm for spiking neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595864/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8874658","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reinforcement learning algorithm for spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"01595864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062258S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10639","isNumber":"33573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10639","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33573","articleId":"1595864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1595865,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The basic idea of this approach, interpreting the clustering problem as a multi-modal optimization one, is similar to that of unsupervised niche clustering proposed by Nasraoui et al. (2005) but instead of evolving only the clusters centers and statistically estimating the other parameters (scales and orientation) we evolve both the centers and the scale parameters of the clusters. Moreover, to simplify the evolutionary process, especially in the case of high-dimensional data, we evolve only hyper-ellipsoids parallel with the axes. In order to describe rotated clusters we used a multi-center representation, i.e. the cluster is covered by several normally oriented hyper-ellipsoids. Besides the fact that it simplifies the evolutionary process, this multi-center representation allows describing almost arbitrary shaped clusters. Preliminary experimental results suggest that the proposed approach ensures a reliable identification of clusters in noisy data providing in the same time multi-center synthetic descriptions for them.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Density based clustering with crowding differential evolution","publicationTitle":"Seventh International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC'05)","doi":"10.1109/SYNASC.2005.31","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10639/33573/01595872.pdf","startPage":"8 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYNASC.2005.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1595872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1595872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Density based clustering with crowding differential evolution","conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1595872/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8874661","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density based clustering with crowding differential evolution","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"01595872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043861S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10639","isNumber":"33573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33573","articleId":"1595872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1595958,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Substrate parasitic effects (substrate currents and propagation loss) are becoming limiting factors to the performance of modern high-speed digital and analog integrated circuits (ICs). Signals traveling along the metal-insulator-silicon-metal (MISM) structure (a fundamental on-chip interconnect unit) will have different attenuation and dispersion when changing operation frequencies and substrate doping densities. These are categorized into three fundamental propagation modes: the slow-wave mode, the dielectric quasi-TEM mode, and the skin-effect mode (Hasegawa et al., 1971). In high-speed radio frequency (RF) circuits, interconnects are likely to operate in the skin-effect mode. In this mode, the nonideal substrate functions as a current return path of the signal, located very close to the oxide layer. Accurate modeling of interconnects in this mode is difficult, because the Courant's stability condition limits most explicit time-domain full-wave Maxwell solvers. To overcome this problem, we apply the alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method (Namiki, 1999) to solve Maxwell's equations. In spite of the conductor loss, we have found considerable substrate current and loss, which depend on the substrate doping and operation frequency","doi":"10.1109/ISDRS.2005.1596139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDRS.2005.1596139","publicationTitle":"2005 International Semiconductor Device Research Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Semiconductor Device Research Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10640/33577/01596139.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Wave Modeling of Substrate Doping Effects and Nonideal Conductors in Integrated Circuit Interconnects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1596139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Full Wave Modeling of Substrate Doping Effects and Nonideal Conductors in Integrated Circuit Interconnects","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8914141","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1596139/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Wave Modeling of Substrate Doping Effects and Nonideal Conductors in Integrated Circuit Interconnects","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"01596139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042462S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10640","isNumber":"33577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10640","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33577","articleId":"1596139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1596214,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The chip is a 128/spl times/32 pixels array where 8 columns have analog direct outputs and 24 have discriminated outputs. The array is divided in four blocks of pixels with different conversion factors and is controlled by a serially programmable sequencer. MIMOSA8 is a representative of the CMOS sensors development option considered as a promising candidate for the vertex detector of the future International Linear Collider (ILC). The readout technique, implemented on the chip, combines high spatial resolution capabilities with high processing readout speed. Data acquisition, providing control of the chip and signal buffering and linked to a VME system, was made on the 8 analog outputs. Analog data, without and with a /sup 55/Fe X-ray source, were acquired and processed using off-line analysis software. From the reconstruction of pixel clusters, built around a central pixel, we deduce that the charge spread is limited to the closest 25 pixels and almost all the available charge is collected. The position of the total charge collection peak (and subsequently the charge-to-voltage conversion factor) stays unaffected when the clocking frequency is increased even up to 150 MHz (13.6 /spl mu/s readout time per frame). The discriminators, placed in the readout chain, have proved to be fully functional. Beam tests have been made with high energy electrons at DESY (Germany) to study detection efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1596214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1596214/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8986060","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a fast programmable active pixel sensor chip designed for charged particle detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a fast programmable active pixel sensor chip designed for charged particle detection","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"01596214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068862S","chronDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10641","isNumber":"33578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10641","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33578","articleId":"1596214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1596271,"authors":[{"name":"Taeyeon Lee","lastName":"Taeyeon Lee","id":"37087065075"},{"name":"Ealgoo Kim","lastName":"Ealgoo Kim","id":"37087186721"},{"name":"Jaehong Park","lastName":"Jaehong Park","id":"37087201185"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9221-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"1596271","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Distortion measurement","Delay","Clocks","Optical pulse generation","Optical reflection","Optical fibers","Optical fiber testing","Laser noise","Optical distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling methods","reflectometers","optical time-domain reflectometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["repetitive sampling","optical time domain reflectometer","ghost effect","short-length fiber","low sampling clock","data acquisition","ghost reflection","delay object","delaying sequence","delay loop steps","10 GHz","10 MHz","100 ps"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1596271","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2005.1596271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2005.1596271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10641/33578/01596271.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of a repetitive sampling measurement for OTDR considering a ghost effect to a short-range measurement with a short-length fiber","abstract":"This paper discusses implementations of a repetitive sampling measurement for OTDR considering ghost effect for short period measurement with a short-length fiber. Repetitive sampling is done to acquire higher equivalent sampling rate with a low sampling clock in the data acquisition. However, the repetitive sampling can cause misalignment of ghost reflection which produces a distortion. This study analyzes the effect of ghost on the repetitive sampling measurement result. The implementations which can be categorized based on the delay object, delaying sequence, and delay loop steps are analyzed for the distortion possibility and proposed to avoid a misaligned ghost reflection measurement.

This mixed signal ASIC consists of both analog and digital devices and a window type discriminator is easily implemented through the use of a digital encoder to encode outputs from two comparators. The charge sensitive preamplifier which is based on gain-boosted (regulated) cascode topology has been tested to have a low optimum equivalent noise charge (ENC) of about 900 e/sup -/+75 e/sup -//pF FWHM at a shaping time of 0.5 /spl mu/s and the gain (voltage output to charge input) is 0.9/pF. The gain of the shaper is about 2.5/pF and the shaping time can be varied slightly from an external pin. This chip is capable of sensing bipolar signals and is linear at least up to 320 fC for negative charge and 150 fC for positive charge. The average ENC of each channel has been calculated to be about 1600 e/sup -/+80 e/sup -//pF FWHM.

The assumption made herein is that the shape of the pulse (which height corresponds to the energy lost by the reaction product) is the impulse response of a dynamic linear system and contains complete information on the ion.

The present contribution proposes a complete procedure for isotopic identification of light charged particles stopped in the CsI(Tl) scintillators. The main idea is to use the cascade of a state-space identification algorithm and a parametric non-linear map using the model parameters as input regressors. The algorithm has been tested on a large set of impulse-responses, and provides a fully-automatic accurate classification of the isotopes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1596568/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8995053","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1596568/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","conferenceDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pulse shape analysis using subspace identification methods and particle identification using neural networks in CsI(Tl) scintillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse shape analysis using subspace identification methods and particle identification using neural networks in CsI(Tl) scintillators","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"01596568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103624S","chronDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10641","isNumber":"33581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10641","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33581","articleId":"1596568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1596638,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Ming Wu","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hsiao-Ming Wu","id":"37087276904"},{"name":"Guodong Sui","affiliation":["Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging, Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Guodong Sui","id":"37087276637"},{"name":"Cheng-Chung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, California Institute of Technology, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Cheng-Chung Lee","id":"37087162859"},{"name":"W.

The chip is flushed with Heparin lock flush between sample collections. The device is remotely controlled by a user-friendly interface and can be programmed to take samples at specific time interval. Preliminary results show that both saline solution and FDG blood samples (/spl sim/220 nano-liter/sample) can be taken with a consistent volume (variation < 2.2% s.d.) at a rate of one sample per second.

However, in clinical implementation most of the dual-energy techniques show limited results mainly due to their sensitivity to noisy data. We simulate data acquisition by a dual-layer CT based on two scintillation layers one on top of the other with which the data is acquired simultaneously. We map the results of the reconstruction into a plane created from the Hounsfield units (HU) of the upper-layer image versus the HU of the lower-layer image. We find that different scanned materials end up in different definable regions in the HU-plane. Application of a special correction on the reconstructed images achieves stability on the HU-plane despite beam-hardening effects. In order to assess the practical material separation capabilities, part of the simulations were done with exact noise calculations. We analyze the material separation capabilities with such a configuration and conclude that the combination of the dual-layer CT with the classification analysis in the HU-plane is a practical and robust method that significantly improves clinical applications, in particular those involving iodine-calcium separation such as analysis and classification of coronary artery calcifications and soft plaques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1596697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1596697/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8976946","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Material separation with dual-layer CT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Material separation with dual-layer CT","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"01596697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058108S","chronDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10641","isNumber":"33582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10641","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"33582","articleId":"1596697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1596707,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The LaBr/sub 3/(5%Ce) Anger-logic detectors in this new scanner use 4/spl times/4/spl times/30 mm pixels and continuous light-guide coupled to a hexagonal array of 50-mm PMTs. The scanner consists of 24 modules with a 93-cm detector diameter and 25-cm axial field-of-view. Initial characterization of scanner performance has been performed, including energy and timing performance. We currently measure an overall system energy resolution of 7.5% and a system timing resolution is 460 ps, although we expect these results to improve eventually when the electronics are fully optimized. Since there are not yet standard tests to quantify the benefit of TOF, we designed two phantoms with hot and cold spheres in 27-cm and 35-cm diameter vessels to evaluate the TOF performance as a function of body size. The data from this scanner are reconstructed with a fully 3D list-mode iterative TOF algorithm with all data corrections incorporated into the system model. We find that TOF reconstruction reduces the noise and background variability, especially for the larger phantom representing a large patient. In addition, TOF improves detail and contrast of the spheres (lesions), especially the smallest 10-mm sphere. The TOF reconstruction reaches convergence faster than the non-TOF reconstruction, and the rate of convergence is seen to be more insensitive to object size. These results indicate that TOF will help improve image quality and potentially reduce scan time with clinical patients.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of a time-of-flight PET scanner based on lanthanum bromide","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2005","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2005.1596707","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10641/33582/01596707.pdf","startPage":"5 pp.","endPage":"1923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2005.1596707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33582","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1596707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1596707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of a time-of-flight PET scanner based on lanthanum bromide","conferenceDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1596707/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8976956","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of a time-of-flight PET scanner based on lanthanum bromide","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"01596707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08881S","chronDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10641","isNumber":"33582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10641","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"33582","articleId":"1596707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1596757,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Bootstrap methods might be very helpful for detection performance studies, whose aim is to evaluate detectability based on large series of statistically equivalent images. However, previous reports regarding bootstrap approaches suggest different results. The goal of this work was to compare the accuracy of three bootstrap methods, namely the list-mode based method used by Dahlbom and the parametric and non-parametric sinogram-based methods proposed by Haynor and by Buvat respectively, for predicting the moments of order 1 and 2 (mean and variance) of reconstructed images in 3D PET. We used simulated data generated with the GATE simulation tool and compared the mean and variance images estimated from 100 repeated scans and from series of 100 bootstrap resampled data generated with the three bootstrap methods. Results indicate that the non-parametric bootstrap method by Buvat based on a small number of statistically equivalent data samples seems to correctly estimate the mean of reconstructed images unlike the other two methods based on one original scan only. The comparison of variance images also indicates significant discrepancies between the method by Buvat and the other two bootstrap methods. However, the variance image from the 100 repeated scans, which served as a gold standard, was too noisy to allow us to determine which bootstrap method was the most accurate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2005.1596757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10641/33582/01596757.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2147","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2005.1596757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of 3D PET data bootstrap resampling methods for numerical observer studies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of 3D PET data bootstrap resampling methods for numerical observer studies","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1596757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8994976","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1596757/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of 3D PET data bootstrap resampling methods for numerical observer studies","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"01596757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039651S","chronDate":"23-29 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10641","isNumber":"33582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10641","xplore-issue":"33582","articleId":"1596757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1596770,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Mutual information between feature vectors extracted from the anatomical and functional images is used as a priori information in a Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of the PET image. The computation of mutual information requires an estimate of the joint density of the two images, which is obtained by using the Parzen window method. Preconditioned conjugate gradient with a bent Armijo line-search is used to maximize the resulting posterior density. The performance of this method is compared with that using a Gaussian quadratic penalty, which does not use anatomical information. Simulation results are presented for PET and MR images generated from a slice of the Hoffman brain phantom.

Simplified for most systems, it can be stated that no extra functionality than required is desired. Hence, when designing a UDP/IP stack in an FPGA a single UDP/IP stack \"template\" design is not suitable to effectively realize the different embedded network system requirements. We present three different UDP/IP stack cores, with different grades of parallelism and suited for various network demands. We show that the UDP/IP core area can be reduced to 1/3 of the original size with an appropriate implementation, accomplished by a trade-off between parallelism/latency and area. Furthermore guidelines are proposed on how to perform the trade-off between parallelism, area (cost), flexibility and functionality when designing an UDP/IP stack for compact embedded network systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of FPGA-based UDP/IP stack parallelism for embedded Ethernet connectivity","publicationTitle":"2005 NORCHIP","doi":"10.1109/NORCHP.2005.1596997","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 NORCHIP","pdfPath":"/iel5/10643/33584/01596997.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHP.2005.1596997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1596997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1596997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of FPGA-based UDP/IP stack parallelism for embedded Ethernet connectivity","conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1596997/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835517","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of FPGA-based UDP/IP stack parallelism for embedded Ethernet connectivity","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"01596997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042878S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10643","isNumber":"33584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10643","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"33584","articleId":"1596997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597013,"authors":[{"name":"A.

On-chip interconnects are best modelled as a network of coupled lines. Hence, their delay estimation has to consider the effect of parasitic coupling between the lines, as the noise due to parasitic coupling between signal wires can result in functional failure or logic error by introducing delays into the circuit. If accurate interconnect delay estimation is to be achieved, modelling interconnects as a distributed RLC line is necessary. In this paper, we present two different closed-form analytical models for estimating the time-delay of a distributed RLC interconnect.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHP.2005.1597035","publicationTitle":"2005 NORCHIP","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 NORCHIP","pdfPath":"/iel5/10643/33584/01597035.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"248","doi":"10.1109/NORCHP.2005.1597035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-delay estimation: two comparative models for distributed on-chip RLC interconnects under ramp excitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Time-delay estimation: two comparative models for distributed on-chip RLC interconnects under ramp excitation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Nov. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1597035/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835555","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597035/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-delay estimation: two comparative models for distributed on-chip RLC interconnects under ramp excitation","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"01597035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04231S","chronDate":"21-22 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10643","isNumber":"33584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10643","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33584","articleId":"1597035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1597037,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Component-based middleware like Enterprise Java-Beans (EJB), Microsoft .NET, and the CORBA Component Model (CCM) have helped improve software reusability through component abstraction. However, as developers have adopted these commercial off-the-shelf technologies, a wide gap has emerged between the availability and sophistication of standard software development tools like compilers and debuggers, and the tools that developers use to compose, analyze, and test a complete system or system of systems. As a result, developers continue to accomplish system integration using ad hoc methods without the support of automated tools. Model-driven development is an emerging paradigm that solves numerous problems associated with the composition and integration of large-scale systems while leveraging advances in software development technologies such as component-based middleware. MDD elevates software development to a higher level of abstraction than is possible with third-generation programming languages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597085/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8925180","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Developing applications using model-driven design environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing applications using model-driven design environments","sourcePdf":"01597085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055218S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"33586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"33586","articleId":"1597085","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1597088,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Further, by applying aspect-oriented techniques and program transformation, small changes at the modeling level can trigger very large transformations at the source code level.

By providing access to many views through cooperation among individual cameras, networks of embedded cameras can potentially support more complex and challenging applications - including smart rooms, surveillance, tracking, and motion analysis - than a single camera. We designed our smart camera as a fully embedded system, focusing on power consumption, QoS management, and limited resources. The camera is a scalable, embedded, high-performance, multiprocessor platform consisting of a network processor and a variable number of digital signal processors (DSPs). Using the implemented software framework, our embedded cameras offer system-level services such as dynamic load distribution and task reconfiguration. In addition, we combined several smart cameras to form a distributed embedded surveillance system that supports cooperation and communication among cameras.","doi":"10.1109/MC.2006.55","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/33586/01597091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2006.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33586","startPage":"68","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed embedded smart cameras for surveillance applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed embedded smart cameras for surveillance applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8925184","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597091/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed embedded smart cameras for surveillance applications","sourcePdf":"01597091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110643S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"33586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"33586","articleId":"1597091","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597110,"authors":[{"name":"Shihao Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/33587/1597110/1597110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shihao Ji received the BS and MS degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

Unlike a maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori training procedure, which yield a point estimate of the CHMM parameters, VB-based training yields an estimate of the full posterior of the model parameters. This is particularly important for small training sets since it gives a measure of confidence in the accuracy of the learned model. This is utilized within the context of active learning, for which we acquire labels for those feature vectors for which knowledge of the associated label would be most informative for reducing model-parameter uncertainty. Three active learning algorithms are considered in this paper: 1) query by committee (QBC), with the goal of selecting data for labeling that minimize the classification variance, 2) a maximum expected information gain method that seeks to label data with the goal of reducing the entropy of the model parameters, and 3) an error-reduction-based procedure that attempts to minimize classification error over the test data. The experimental results are presented for synthetic and measured data. We demonstrate that all of these active learning methods can significantly reduce the amount of required labeling, compared to random selection of samples for labeling.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.85","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/33587/01597110.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Bayes for continuous hidden Markov models and its application to active learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597110/","displayDocTitle":"Variational Bayes for continuous hidden Markov models and its application to active learning","volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8935249","pubMedId":"16566502","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597110/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Bayes for continuous hidden Markov models and its application to active learning","sourcePdf":"01597110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074521S","chronDate":"April  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"33587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"33587","articleId":"1597110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597111,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Given n points in d-dimensional space and the number of desired clusters k, k-means seeks a set of k-cluster centers so as to minimize the sum of the squared Euclidean distance between each point and its nearest cluster center. However, the algorithm is very sensitive to the initial selection of centers and is likely to converge to partitions that are significantly inferior to the global optimum. We present a genetic algorithm (GA) for evolving centers in the k-means algorithm that simultaneously identifies good partitions for a range of values around a specified k. The set of centers is represented using a hyper-quadtree constructed on the data. This representation is exploited in our GA to generate an initial population of good centers and to support a novel crossover operation that selectively passes good subsets of neighboring centers from parents to offspring by swapping subtrees. Experimental results indicate that our GA finds the global optimum for data sets with known optima and finds good solutions for large simulated data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.66","startPage":"533","endPage":"543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/33587/01597111.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm using hyper-quadtrees for low-dimensional k-means clustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597111/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm using hyper-quadtrees for low-dimensional k-means clustering","volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1597111/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8935250","pubMedId":"16566503","publicationDate":"April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm using hyper-quadtrees for low-dimensional k-means clustering","sourcePdf":"01597111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103739S","chronDate":"April  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"33587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"33587","articleId":"1597111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":1597116,"authors":[{"name":"Li Fei-Fei","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/33587/1597116/1597116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Fei-Fei graduated from Princeton University in 1999 with a physics degree.

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/33587/01597116.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-shot learning of object categories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"One-shot learning of object categories","volume":"28","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597116/","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8935255","pubMedId":"16566508","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597116/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-shot learning of object categories","sourcePdf":"01597116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0937S","chronDate":"April  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"33587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1127","xplore-issue":"33587","articleId":"1597116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1597121,"authors":[{"name":"Kuk-Jin Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kuk-Jin Yoon","id":"37269268600"},{"name":"In So Kweon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"In So Kweon","id":"37270474800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"1597121","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":835,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":5336},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Pixel","Image segmentation","Layout","Costs","Colored noise","Image analysis","Power measurement","Performance evaluation","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image colour analysis","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive support-weight approach","correspondence search","window-based method","support window","color similarity","geometric proximity","image ambiguity reduction","standard stereo benchmarks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stereo","3D/stereo scene analysis."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biomimetics","Colorimetry","Feedback","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photogrammetry","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"We present a new window-based method for correspondence search using varying support-weights.

Correspondence between multiple cameras is one of the most important and basic problems which visual surveillance using multiple cameras brings. In this paper, we propose a simple and robust method, based on principal axes of people, to match people across multiple cameras. The correspondence likelihood reflecting the similarity of pairs of principal axes of people is constructed according to the relationship between \"ground-points\" of people detected in each camera view and the intersections of principal axes detected in different camera views and transformed to the same view. Our method has the following desirable properties; 1) camera calibration is not needed; 2) accurate motion detection and segmentation are less critical due to the robustness of the principal axis-based feature to noise; 3) based on the fused data derived from correspondence results, positions of people in each camera view can be accurately located even when the people are partially occluded in all views. The experimental results on several real video sequences from outdoor environments have demonstrated the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our method.","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/33587/01597123.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.80","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.80","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597123","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Surveillance","Calibration","Noise robustness","Motion detection","Working environment noise","Video sequences","Computer vision","Image sequences","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video cameras","surveillance","image sequences","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal axis-based correspondence","multiple cameras","people tracking","visual surveillance","correspondence likelihood","motion detection","motion segmentation","video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correspondence between multiple cameras","principal axes","people tracking."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Biological","Movement","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photogrammetry","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique","Video Recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Principal axis-based correspondence between multiple cameras for people tracking","accessionNumber":"8935262","pubMedId":"16566515","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597123/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal axis-based correspondence between multiple cameras for people tracking","sourcePdf":"01597123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076625S","chronDate":"April  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"33587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"33587","articleId":"1597123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1597131,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The system relies on a novel real-time and low-cost 3-D sensor that generates a dense range image of the scene. By exploiting 3-D information we are able to limit the constraints usually posed on the environment and the placement of the hand, and this greatly contributes to the unobtrusiveness of the system. Efficient, close to real-time algorithms for hand segmentation, localization and 3-D feature measurement are described and tested on an image database simulating a variety of working conditions. The performance of the system is shown to be similar to state-of-the-art hand geometry authentication techniques but without sacrificing the convenience of the user.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2005.863508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/33588/01597131.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"21","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2005.863508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personal authentication using 3-D finger geometry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Personal authentication using 3-D finger geometry","volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1597131/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8798099","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personal authentication using 3-D finger geometry","sourcePdf":"01597131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052498S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"33588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"33588","articleId":"1597131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":1597139,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The emulation scheme aims to replicate the dynamical behavior of the target robot interacting with an environment, without dealing with a complex calculation of the contact dynamics. This method forms a basis for the task verification of a flexible space robot. The actual emulating robot is structurally rigid, while the target robot can represent any class of robots, e.g., flexible, redundant, or space robots. Although the emulating robot is not dynamically equivalent to the target robot, the dynamical similarity can be achieved by using a control law developed herein. The effect of disturbances and actuator dynamics on the fidelity and the contact stability of the robot emulation is thoroughly analyzed. The concept of robot emulation is demonstrated by performing a number of preliminary experiments for emulation of flexible-joint robots.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2005.863367","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/33590/01597174.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2005.863367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emulation of robots interacting with environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Emulation of robots interacting with environment","volume":"11","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8859769","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597174/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597174/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emulation of robots interacting with environment","sourcePdf":"01597174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082212S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"33590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33590","articleId":"1597174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1597191,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

The fault detection algorithm is derived using a combination of structural analysis, observer design and Analytical Redundancy Relation (ARR) design. Structural considerations on the system is used to divide it into two cascaded connected subsystems, giving an example on using a general structural approach to divide a complex problem into a set of less complex and solvable problems. The variables connecting the two subsystems are observed using an adaptive observer derived on the basis of the equations describing the first subsystem. No faults are expected to affect the first subsystem, therefore only the second subsystem is considered in the design of the fault detection algorithm. The fault detection algorithm is based on an ARR, which is designed using structural analysis and the Groebner basis algorithm. The polynomial form of the obtained ARR is utilized to achieve robustness w.r.t. parameter variations by using a set-valued approach. The applicability of the algorithm is illustrated by applying it to an industrial benchmark. The benchmark tests have shown that the algorithm is capable of detecting four different faults in the mechanical and hydraulic parts of the pump.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/33591/01597191.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2005.860524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2005.860524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model based fault detection in a centrifugal pump application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Benchmark testing","Induction motors","Redundancy","Joining processes","Equations","Basis algorithms","Polynomials","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","pumps","induction motors","observers","water supply","machine control","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model based fault detection","centrifugal pump application","induction motor","structural analysis","observer design","analytical redundancy relation design","cascaded connected subsystems","adaptive observer","Groebner basis algorithm","set-valued approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Centrifugal pumps","structural analysis","analytical redundancy relation (ARR)","Groebner basis","set-valued approach","adaptive observers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Model based fault detection in a centrifugal pump application","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1597191/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8945631","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model based fault detection in a centrifugal pump application","sourcePdf":"01597191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125055S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"33591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"33591","articleId":"1597191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597193,"authors":[{"name":"Taeyoung Chung","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/33591/1597193/1597193-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taeyoung Chung received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Kookmin University, Korea, in 1996 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in automotive engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998 and 2005, respectively.","Since September 2005, he has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with the University of California at Berkeley.

A differential braking control law based on vehicle planar motion has been designed using a three-degree-of-freedom yaw plane vehicle model. The control threshold for the VSC is designed based on the vehicle body side slip angle. Since VSC always works with the driver, the overall vehicle performance will depend not on how well the VSC works but rather on its interaction with the human driver. Vehicle behavior and interactions between the vehicle, the controller, and the human driver are investigated using a vehicle simulator on a virtual test track (VTT). The VTT consists of a real-time vehicle simulator, a visual animation engine, a visual display, and human-vehicle interfaces. The VTT has been developed and used for the evaluation of the VSC under various realistic conditions in the laboratory. In this paper, the effects of the different control threshold on the vehicle-driver-controller interaction for a novice and expert driver are compared. Test results obtained using the VTT establish the need for a variable control threshold. The VTT makes it possible to perform exhaustive design trials and evaluations in the laboratory without risk of injury before field testing and promises to significantly reduce development cost and cycle time.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2005.863649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2005.863649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33591","startPage":"224","endPage":"234","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/33591/01597193.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Testing","Automotive electronics","Vehicle driving","Humans","Laboratories","Motion control","Biological system modeling","Animation","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles","stability","traffic engineering computing","motion control","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["side slip angle-based vehicle stability control schemes","virtual test track","differential braking control","vehicle planar motion","yaw plane vehicle model","vehicle simulator","visual animation engine","visual display","human-vehicle interfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control threshold","differential braking","human-in-the-loop evaluation","side slip angle","vehicle stability control","virtual test track"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of side slip angle-based vehicle stability control scheme on a virtual test track","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8945633","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597193/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597193/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of side slip angle-based vehicle stability control scheme on a virtual test track","sourcePdf":"01597193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064072S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"33591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"33591","articleId":"1597193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":1597197,"authors":[{"name":"Bei Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, California State University, San Marcos, Long Beach, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/33591/1597197/1597197-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bei Lu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Power and Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from North Carolina State University in 2004.

The state of the controller is reset to guarantee the stability requirement of the Lyapunov function when the switching event occurs. Two parameter-dependent switching logics, hysteresis switching and switching with average dwell time, are examined.

We first study a joint power and rate allocation problem that attempts to maximize the expected throughput of the system. This problem is inherently difficult because it is in fact a nonconvex optimization problem. To solve this problem, we develop a distributed algorithm based on dynamic pricing. This algorithm provides a power and rate allocation that is asymptotically optimal in the number of mobiles. We also study the effect of various factors on the development of efficient resource allocation strategies. Finally, using the outcome of the power and rate allocation algorithm, we develop a pricing-based base-station assignment algorithm that results in an overall joint resource allocation and base-station assignment. In this algorithm, a base-station is assigned to each mobile taking into account the congestion level of the base-station as well as the transmission environment of the mobile.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.863480","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33592/01597219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.863480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint resource allocation and base-station assignment for the downlink in CDMA networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Joint resource allocation and base-station assignment for the downlink in CDMA networks","volume":"14","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8872710","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597219/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597219/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint resource allocation and base-station assignment for the downlink in CDMA networks","sourcePdf":"01597219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094064S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"33592","articleId":"1597219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597220,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The optimal sensor activation problem is a very difficult decision question, and under Markovian assumptions on the sensor discharge/recharge periods, it represents a complex semi-Markov decision problem. With the goal of developing a practical, distributed but efficient solution to this complex, global optimization problem, we first consider the activation question for a set of sensor nodes whose coverage areas overlap completely. For this scenario, we show analytically that there exists a simple threshold activation policy that achieves a performance of at least 3/4 of the optimum over all possible policies. We extend this threshold policy to a general network setting where the coverage areas of different sensors could have partial or no overlap with each other, and show by simulations that the performance of our policy is very close to that of the globally optimal policy. Our policy is fully distributed, and requires the sensor nodes to only keep track of the node activation states in its immediate neighborhood. We also consider the effects of spatial correlation on the performance of the threshold activation policy, and the choice of the optimal threshold.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.863710","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33592/01597220.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.863710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33592","startPage":"15","endPage":"26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic node activation in networks of rechargeable sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic node activation in networks of rechargeable sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8872711","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597220/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic node activation in networks of rechargeable sensors","sourcePdf":"01597220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079696S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"33592","articleId":"1597220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1597221,"authors":[{"name":"Z.J.

SWIM is able to reduce the delay of packet delivery at the expense of increased storage at the network nodes. Furthermore, SWIM improves the overall capacity-delay tradeoff by only moderately increasing the storage requirements. This tradeoff is examined here in the context of a practical application-acquisition of telemetry data from radio-tagged whales. To reduce the storage requirements, without affecting the network delay, we propose and study a number of schemes for deletion of obsolete information from the network nodes. In particular, through the use of Markov chains, we compare the performance of five such storage deletion schemes, which, by increasing the computational complexity of the routing algorithm, mitigate the storage requirements. The results of our study will allow a network designer to implement such a system and to tune its performance in a delay-tolerant environment with intermittent connectivity, as to ensure with some chosen level of confidence that the information is successfully carried through the mobile network and delivered within some time period.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.863461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33592","startPage":"27","endPage":"40","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33592/01597221.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new networking model for biological applications of ad hoc sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597221/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new networking model for biological applications of ad hoc sensor networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8872712","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new networking model for biological applications of ad hoc sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01597221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088256S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"33592","articleId":"1597221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597222,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For source coding of correlated data, we consider a joint entropy-based coding model with explicit communication where coding is simple and the transmission structure optimization is difficult. We first formulate the optimization problem definition in the general case and then we study further a network setting where the entropy conditioning at nodes does not depend on the amount of side information, but only on its availability. We prove that even in this simple case, the optimization problem is NP-hard. We propose some efficient, scalable, and distributed heuristic approximation algorithms for solving this problem and show by numerical simulations that the total transmission cost can be significantly improved over direct transmission or the shortest path tree. We also present an approximation algorithm that provides a tree transmission structure with total cost within a constant factor from the optimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33592/01597222.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.863711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.863711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network correlated data gathering with explicit communication: NP-completeness and algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tree graphs","Cost function","Approximation algorithms","Computer networks","Laboratories","Source coding","Entropy","Availability","Heuristic algorithms","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","optimisation","tree data structures","entropy codes","distributed algorithms","tree codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network correlated data gathering","explicit communication","NP-complete optimization","sink node","tree-based communication structure","joint entropy-based coding model","distributed heuristic approximation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conditional coding","correlated data gathering","distributed algorithms","NP-completeness","routing tree","sensor networks","traveling salesman"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Network correlated data gathering with explicit communication: NP-completeness and algorithms","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1597222/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8872713","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network correlated data gathering with explicit communication: NP-completeness and algorithms","sourcePdf":"01597222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169671S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"33592","articleId":"1597222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597223,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Redundancy within a sensor network can be exploited to reduce the communication cost incurred in execution of such queries. Any reduction in communication cost would result in an efficient use of the battery energy, which is very limited in sensors. One approach to reduce the communication cost of a query is to self-organize the network, in response to a query, into a topology that involves only a small subset of the sensors sufficient to process the query. The query is then executed using only the sensors in the constructed topology. The self-organization technique is beneficial for queries that run sufficiently long to amortize the communication cost incurred in self-organization. In this paper, we design and analyze algorithms for suchself-organization of a sensor network to reduce energy consumption. In particular, we develop the notion of a connected sensor cover and design a centralized approximation algorithm that constructs a topology involving a near-optimal connected sensor cover. We prove that the size of the constructed topology is within an O(logn) factor of the optimal size, where n is the network size. We develop a distributed self-organization version of the approximation algorithm, and propose several optimizations to reduce the communication overhead of the algorithm. We also design another distributed algorithm based on node priorities that has a further lower communication overhead, but does not provide any guarantee on the size of the connected sensor cover constructed. Finally, we evaluate the distributed algorithms using simulations and show that our approaches results in significant communication cost reductions.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.863478","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33592/01597223.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.863478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connected sensor cover: self-organization of sensor networks for efficient query execution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597223/","displayDocTitle":"Connected sensor cover: self-organization of sensor networks for efficient query execution","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8872714","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597223/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connected sensor cover: self-organization of sensor networks for efficient query execution","sourcePdf":"01597223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137925S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"33592","articleId":"1597223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597224,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Since, however, the generation of detailed traffic statistics does not scale well with link speed, increasingly routers and measurement boxes implement sampling strategies at the packet level. In this paper, we study both theoretically and practically what information about the original traffic can be inferred when sampling, or \"thinning\", is performed at the packet level. While basic packet level characteristics such as first order statistics can be fairly directly recovered, other aspects require more attention. We focus mainly on the spectral density, a second-order statistic, and the distribution of the number of packets per flow, showing how both can be exactly recovered, in theory. We then show in detail why in practice this cannot be done using the traditional packet based sampling, even for high sampling rate. We introduce an alternative flow-based thinning, where practical inversion is possible even at arbitrarily low sampling rate. We also investigate the theory and practice of fitting the parameters of a Poisson cluster process, modeling the full packet traffic, from sampled data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverting sampled traffic","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.863456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33592/01597224.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.863456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Inverting sampled traffic","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1597224/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8872715","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverting sampled traffic","sourcePdf":"01597224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132596S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"33592","articleId":"1597224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597236,"authors":[{"name":"Canhui Ou","affiliation":["AT and T Services, Inc., San Ramon, CA, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/33592/1597236/1597236-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Canhui (Sam) Ou (S'02) received the B.S. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Davis, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently a Principal Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Services, Inc., San Ramon, CA.

An important open research problem on data over SONET/SDH (DoS) is survivability: SONET automatic protection switching is too resource inefficient for data services, and the protection mechanisms of data networks are too slow for mission-critical applications. We propose two approaches for provisioning survivable DoS connections. Our approaches exploit the tradeoff between resource overbuild and fault-recovery time while utilizing the inverse-multiplexing capability of virtual concatenation to increase backup sharing. Our results show that one approach achieves low resource overbuild and much faster fault recovery than that of data networks, and the other approach achieves fast fault recovery comparable to SONET 50-ms protection (for typical U.S. backbone networks) while still achieving modest backup sharing. We further investigate the tradeoff between network blocking performance and network control and management complexity resulting from the number of paths M a connection can be inversely multiplexed onto: larger M leads to more freedom in routing and better network performance but increases network control and management complexity. Our results indicate that the network blocking performance for small values of M (e.g., M=2 for some representative backbone network topologies) is almost as good as the case in which M is infinity.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.863462","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33592/01597236.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.863462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33592","startPage":"218","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survivable virtual concatenation for data over SONET/SDH in optical transport networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Survivable virtual concatenation for data over SONET/SDH in optical transport networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8872727","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597236/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survivable virtual concatenation for data over SONET/SDH in optical transport networks","sourcePdf":"01597236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154022S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"33592","articleId":"1597236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597249,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The formant tracker incorporates an adaptive voicing detector and a gender detector for formant extraction from continuous speech, for both male and female speakers. The algorithm has a low signal delay and provides smooth and accurate estimates for the first four formant frequencies at moderate and high signal-to-noise ratios.

Independent SNR scalable structures offer the possibility of providing bit rate scalable functionality to existing nonscalable coders and standards. We show that the MPEG-4 scalable coders are examples of dependent SNR scalable coders, and we introduce a new independent SNR scalable coder called CELPTree, which has the additional advantage of being low delay. We compare the performance of the MPEG-4 coders and CELPTree for both clean and noisy speech, and we examine the effects of frequency-weighted distortion measures in the enhancement layers of SNR scalable speech coders.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597259/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","volume":"14","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"8783206","publicationDate":"March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597259/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Structures for SNR scalable speech coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structures for SNR scalable speech coding","sourcePdf":"01597259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102175S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33593","articleId":"1597259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":1597261,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A typical bandwidth is 0.3-3.4 kHz, but recently it has been suggested that mobile phone networks will facilitate an audio signal bandwidth of 50 Hz-7 kHz. This is suggested since an increased bandwidth will increase the sound quality of the speech signals. Since only few telephones initially will have this facility, a method extending the conventional narrow frequency-band speech signal into a wide-band speech signal utilizing the receiving telephone only is suggested. This will give the impression of a wide-band speech signal. The proposed speech bandwidth extension method is based on models of speech acoustics and fundamentals of human hearing. The extension maps each speech feature separately. Care has been taken to deal with implementation aspects, such as noisy speech signals, speech signal delays, computational complexity, and processing memory usage.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.855837","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33593/01597261.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"588","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.855837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity feature-mapped speech bandwidth extension","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity feature-mapped speech bandwidth extension","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8783208","publicationDate":"March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597261/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity feature-mapped speech bandwidth extension","sourcePdf":"01597261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068107S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33593","articleId":"1597261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1597262,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Indeed, speech-based interface design has been an expert job for a long time. It necessitates good skills in speech technologies and low-level programming. Moreover, rapid development and reusability of previously designed systems remains uneasy. This makes optimality and objective evaluation of design very difficult. The design process is therefore a cyclic process composed of prototype releases, user satisfaction surveys, bug reports and refinements. It is well known that human intervention for testing is time-consuming and above all very expensive. This is one of the reasons for the recent interest in dialog simulation for evaluation as well as for design automation and optimization. In this paper we expose a probabilistic framework for a realistic simulation of spoken dialogs in which the major components of a dialog system are modeled and parameterized thanks to independent data or expert knowledge. Especially, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system model and a User Model (UM) have been developed. The ASR model, based on articulatory similarities in language models, provides task-adaptive performance prediction and Confidence Level (CL) distribution estimation. The user model relies on the Bayesian Networks (BN) paradigm and is used both for user behavior modeling and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modeling. The complete simulation framework has been used to train a reinforcement-learning agent on two different tasks. These experiments helped to point out several potentially problematic dialog scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.855836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33593/01597262.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.855836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic framework for dialog simulation and optimal strategy learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597262/","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic framework for dialog simulation and optimal strategy learning","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8783209","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597262/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic framework for dialog simulation and optimal strategy learning","sourcePdf":"01597262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075852S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"33593","articleId":"1597262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1597268,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

The direct method also tends to cancel tonal audio signals such as alarms and music. We propose using a system identification method in closed-loop for unbiased feedback cancellation which does not possess the negative characteristics manifested by the direct method, but uses an identification signal. The two-stage method which employs two adaptive filters, one to identify the entire closed-loop, and another to extract the feedback path response was the preferred unbiased method due to its low computation and good feedback identification particularly during \"howling.\" This paper presents the theory of the proposed new method, and computer simulations which demonstrate its advantages over the widely used direct method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8783215","htmlLink":"/document/1597268/","displayDocTitle":"Unbiased adaptive feedback cancellation in hearing aids by closed-loop identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbiased adaptive feedback cancellation in hearing aids by closed-loop identification","sourcePdf":"01597268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054005S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"33593","articleId":"1597268","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597269,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The existing methods for active noise control systems with online secondary path modeling consist of three adaptive filters. The main feature of the proposed method is that it uses only two adaptive filters. In the proposed method, the modified-FxLMS (MFxLMS) algorithm is used in adapting the noise control filter and a new variable step size (VSS) least mean square (LMS) algorithm is proposed for adaptation of the secondary path modeling filter. This VSS LMS algorithm is different from the normalized-LMS (NLMS) algorithm, where the step size is varied in accordance with the power of the reference signal. Here, on the other hand, the step size is varied in accordance with the power of the disturbance signal in the desired response of the modeling filter. The basic idea of the proposed VSS algorithm stems from the fact that the disturbance signal in the desired response of the modeling filter is decreasing in nature, (ideally) converging to zero. Hence, a small step size is used initially and later its value is increased accordingly. The disturbance signal, however, is not available directly, and we propose an indirect method to track its variations. Computer simulations show that the proposed method gives better performance than the existing methods. This improved performance is achieved at the cost of a slightly increased computational complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33593/01597274.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.855829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.855829","startPage":"720","endPage":"726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new variable step size LMS algorithm-based method for improved online secondary path modeling in active noise control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597274/","displayDocTitle":"A new variable step size LMS algorithm-based method for improved online secondary path modeling in active noise control systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597274/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"8783221","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new variable step size LMS algorithm-based method for improved online secondary path modeling in active noise control systems","sourcePdf":"01597274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061587S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"33593","articleId":"1597274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1597304,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Vector control of the grid-side inverter allows power factor regulation of the windmill. This paper shows the dynamic performance of the complete system. Different experimental tests in a 3-kW prototype have been carried out to verify the benefits of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2005.853735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/33594/01597329.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2005.853735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of permanent-magnet generators applied to variable-speed wind-energy systems connected to the grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Control of permanent-magnet generators applied to variable-speed wind-energy systems connected to the grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597329/","publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8870372","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597329/","volume":"21","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of permanent-magnet generators applied to variable-speed wind-energy systems connected to the grid","sourcePdf":"01597329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056386S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"33594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"925","xplore-issue":"33594","articleId":"1597329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1597331,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The effectiveness of passive islanding detection methods (IDMs) is usually demonstrated by means of nondetection zones (NDZs) represented in a power mismatch space (/spl Delta/P versus /spl Delta/Q). Active frequency drifting IDMs have been shown to provide improved performance but their theoretical NDZ cannot be described in the /spl Delta/P versus /spl Delta/Q space for a general RLC load. This paper shows that a load parameter space based on the values of the quality factor and resonant frequency of the local load (Q/sub f/ versus f/sub 0/) can be used in these cases. It employs a single curve to represent the NDZ of frequency drifting IDMs for any RLC loads. Equations that represent NDZs of three common active IDMs in the Q/sub f/ versus f/sub 0/ load parameter space are derived and it is shown that the slip mode frequency shift and the Sandia frequency shift IDMs can be designed to guarantee islanding detection for equivalent RLC loads with a quality factor smaller than a design value. The accuracy of the NDZs is verified with simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2005.859981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/33594/01597334.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2005.859981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment of active frequency drifting islanding detection methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597334/","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of active frequency drifting islanding detection methods","volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8870377","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597334/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of active frequency drifting islanding detection methods","sourcePdf":"01597334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066691S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"33594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"286","xplore-issue":"33594","articleId":"1597334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":1597336,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, the generated power from renewable energies is always fluctuating due to environmental status. Energy storage system is indispensable to compensate these fluctuating components. Energy capacitor system (ECaSS) connected an electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) with power-electronics devices is useful for the compensation of fluctuating power since one is capable of controlling both active and reactive power simultaneously. This paper proposes the current-source ECaSS (CS-ECS), which consists of EDLC, bi-directional DC-DC converter, and current-source inverter.

Fundamental frequency models have been presented but these models are often complex with significant numerical overhead as the power converter block consisting of power control, rotor side and grid side converter control and DC link are often simulated in detail. This paper develops a simple DFIG wind turbine model in which the power converter is simulated as a controlled voltage source, regulating the rotor current to meet the command of real and reactive power production. This model has the form of traditional generator model and hence is easy to integrate into the power system simulation tool such as PSS/E. As an example, the interaction between the Arklow Bank Wind Farm and the Irish National Grid was simulated using the proposed model. The model performance and accuracy was also compared with the detailed model developed by DIgSILENT. Considering the simplification adopted for the model development, the limitation and applicability of the model were also discussed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8870388","htmlLink":"/document/1597345/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of the wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generator for grid integration studies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of the wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generator for grid integration studies","sourcePdf":"01597345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066897S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"33594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"465","xplore-issue":"33594","articleId":"1597345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597347,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

Hourly forecasts up to 72-h ahead are produced for a wind park on the Greek island of Crete. As inputs our models use the numerical forecasts of wind speed and direction provided by atmospheric modeling system SKIRON for four nearby positions up to 30 km away from the wind turbine cluster. Three types of local recurrent neural networks are employed as forecasting models, namely, the infinite impulse response multilayer perceptron (IIR-MLP), the local activation feedback multilayer network (LAF-MLN), and the diagonal recurrent neural network (RNN). These networks contain internal feedback paths, with the neuron connections implemented by means of IIR synaptic filters. Two novel and optimal on-line learning schemes are suggested for the update of the recurrent network's weights based on the recursive prediction error algorithm. The methods assure continuous stability of the network during the learning phase and exhibit improved performance compared to the conventional dynamic back propagation. Extensive experimentation is carried out where the three recurrent networks are additionally compared to two static models, a finite-impulse response NN (FIR-NN) and a conventional static-MLP network. Simulation results demonstrate that the recurrent models, trained by the suggested methods, outperform the static ones while they exhibit significant improvement over the persistent method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/33594/01597347.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2005.847954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2005.847954","startPage":"273","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term wind speed and power forecasting using local recurrent neural network models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597347/","displayDocTitle":"Long-term wind speed and power forecasting using local recurrent neural network models","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597347/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"8870390","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term wind speed and power forecasting using local recurrent neural network models","sourcePdf":"01597347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105301S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"33594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"351","xplore-issue":"33594","articleId":"1597347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1597349,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In contrast to continuous-flow systems that rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves, digital microfluidics offers a scalable system architecture and dynamic reconfigurability; groups of unit cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. As more bioassays are executed concurrently on a biochip, system integration and design complexity are expected to increase dramatically. This paper presents an overview of an integrated system-level design methodology that attempts to address key issues in the synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of digital microfluidics-based biochips. Different actuation mechanisms for microfluidics-based biochips, and associated design-automation trends and challenges are also discussed. The proposed top-down design-automation approach is expected to relieve biochip users from the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming hardware design, and costly testing and maintenance procedures, and it will facilitate the integration of fluidic components with a microelectronic component in next-generation systems-on-chips (SOCs).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597355/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","volume":"25","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microfluidics-Based Biochips: Technology Issues, Implementation Platforms, and Design-Automation Challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microfluidics-Based Biochips: Technology Issues, Implementation Platforms, and Design-Automation Challenges","sourcePdf":"01597355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116748S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"33595","articleId":"1597355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597356,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Due to the increased complexities associated with model setup and computational time requirements, current design approaches using spatial and time-resolved multiphysics modeling, though viable for component-level characterization, become unaffordable for system-level design. To overcome these limitations, we present models for the system-level simulation of fluid flow, electric field, and analyte dispersion in microfluidic devices. Compact models are used to compute the flow (pressure driven and electroosmotic) and are based on the integral formulation of the mass, momentum, and current conservation equations. An analytical model based on the method-of-moments approach has been developed to characterize the dispersion induced by combined pressure and electrokinetic-driven flow. The methodology has been validated against detailed three-dimensional (3-D) simulations and has been used to analyze hydrostatic-pressure effects in electrophoretic separation chips. A 100-fold improvement in the computational time without significantly compromising the accuracy (error less than 10%) has been demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-Level Simulation of Flow-Induced Dispersion in Lab-on-a-Chip Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.858354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/33595/01597362.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.858354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"System-Level Simulation of Flow-Induced Dispersion in Lab-on-a-Chip Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1597362/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-Level Simulation of Flow-Induced Dispersion in Lab-on-a-Chip Systems","sourcePdf":"01597362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083595S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33595","articleId":"1597362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1597363,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

DNA chips are manufactured through a highly scalable process called very large-scale immobilized polymer synthesis (VLSIPS) that combines photolithographic technologies adapted from the semiconductor industry with combinatorial chemistry. Commercially available DNA chips contain more than half a million probes and are expected to exceed 100 million probes in the next generation. This paper is one of the first attempts to apply very large scale integration (VLSI) computer-aided design methods to the physical design of DNA chips, where the main objective is to minimize total border cost (i.e., the number of nucleotide mismatches between adjacent sites). By exploiting analogies between manufacturing processes for DNA arrays and for VLSI chips, the authors demonstrate the potential for transfer of methodologies from the 40-year-old field of electronic design automation to the newer DNA array design field. The main contributions of this paper are the following. First, it proposes several partitioning-based algorithms for DNA probe placement that improve solution quality by over 4% compared to best previously known methods. Second, it gives a new design flow for DNA arrays, which enhances current methodologies by adding flow awareness to each optimization step and introducing feedback loops. Third, it proposes solution methods for new formulations integrating multiple design steps, including probe selection, placement, and embedding. Finally, it introduces new techniques to experimentally evaluate the scalability and suboptimality of existing and newly proposed probe placement algorithms. Interestingly, the authors find that DNA placement algorithms appear to have better suboptimality properties than those recently reported for VLSI placement algorithms [C.C.

In addition, an approach toward automatic mapping of a biochemical analysis task onto a DMFS is investigated. Achieving optimality in these algorithms can be prohibitive for large-scale configurations because of the high asymptotic complexity of coordinating multiple moving droplets. Instead, these algorithms achieve a compromise between high runtime efficiency and a more limited nonglobal optimality in the generated control sequences.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/33595/01597365.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.855958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.855958","startPage":"334","endPage":"344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Controlling Parallel Tasks in Droplet-Based Microfluidic Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597365/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Controlling Parallel Tasks in Droplet-Based Microfluidic Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597365/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Controlling Parallel Tasks in Droplet-Based Microfluidic Systems","sourcePdf":"01597365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115626S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"33595","articleId":"1597365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597366,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

In this paper, the effects of variations in the basic array-layout design, droplet-routing control algorithms, and droplet spacing on system performance are characterized.

It is well known that the leakage power consumed by a digital CMOS circuit depends strongly on the state of its inputs. The authors' first leakage reduction technique leverages a fundamental property of basic FPGA logic elements [look-up tables (LUTs)] that allows a logic signal in an FPGA design to be interchanged with its complemented form without any area or delay penalty. This property is applied to select polarities for logic signals so that FPGA hardware structures spend the majority of time in low-leakage states. In an experimental study, active leakage power is optimized in circuits mapped into a state-of-the-art 90-nm commercial FPGA. Results show that the proposed approach reduces active leakage by 25%, on average. The authors' second approach to leakage optimization consists of altering the routing step of the FPGA computer-aided design (CAD) flow to encourage more frequent use of routing resources that have low leakage power consumptions. Such \"leakage-aware routing\" allows active leakage to be further reduced, without compromising design performance. Combined, the two approaches offer a total active leakage power reduction of 30%, on average.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.853692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/33596/01597379.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.853692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active leakage power optimization for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597379/","displayDocTitle":"Active leakage power optimization for FPGAs","volume":"25","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597379/","publicationDate":"March 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8805563","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active leakage power optimization for FPGAs","sourcePdf":"01597379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125088S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"33596","articleId":"1597379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1597384,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

In this paper, the authors focus on the high-performance single-layer bus routing problem, where the objective is to match the lengths of all nets belonging to each bus. An effective approach to solve this problem is to allocate extra routing resources around short nets during routing, and use those resources for length extension afterwards. First, a provably optimal algorithm for routing nets with minimum-area maximum-length constraints is proposed. Then, this algorithm is extended to the case where minimum constraints are given as exact length bounds, and it is also proven that this algorithm is near-optimal. Both algorithms proposed are shown to be scalable for large circuits, since the respective time complexities are O(A) and O(AlogA), where A is the area of the intermediate region between chips.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.853685","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/33596/01597384.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.853685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"490","endPage":"503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithmic study of single-layer bus routing for high-speed boards","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Algorithmic study of single-layer bus routing for high-speed boards","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597384/","volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1597384/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8805568","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithmic study of single-layer bus routing for high-speed boards","sourcePdf":"01597384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077028S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"33596","articleId":"1597384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597386,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The problem of routing pipelined signals is different from the conventional FPGA routing problem. The two-terminal N/sub D/ pipelined routing problem is to find the lowest cost route between a source and sink that goes through at least N (N/spl ges/1) distinct pipelining resources. In the case of a multiterminal pipelined signal, the problem is to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) that contains sufficient pipelining resources such that pipelining constraints at each sink are satisfied. In this paper, we first present an optimal algorithm for finding a lowest cost 1/sub D/ route. The optimal 1/sub D/ algorithm is then used as a building block for a greedy two-terminal N/sub D/ router. Next, we discuss the development of a multiterminal routing algorithm (PipeRoute) that effectively leverages both the 1/sub D/ and N/sub D/ routers. Finally, we present a preprocessing heuristic that enables the application of PipeRoute to pipelined FPGA architectures. PipeRoute's performance is evaluated by routing a set of benchmark netlists on the reconfigurable pipelined datapath (RaPiD) architecture. Our results show that the architecture overhead incurred in routing netlists on RaPiD is less than 20%. Further, the results indicate a possible trend between the architecture overhead and the percentage of pipelined signals in a netlist.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8805570","htmlLink":"/document/1597386/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PipeRoute: a pipelining-aware router for reconfigurable architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PipeRoute: a pipelining-aware router for reconfigurable architectures","sourcePdf":"01597386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113749S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33596","articleId":"1597386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597388,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Our methodology uses a unified RTL circuit representation, called assignment-decision diagrams (ADDs), for test analysis. Test generation proceeds by abstracting the components in this unified representation using input/output propagation rules, so that any justification/propagation event can be captured as a Boolean implication. Consequently, we reduce RTL test generation to an SAT instance that has a significantly lower complexity than the equivalent problem at the gate level. Our algorithm is tailored to overcome the disadvantages of several existing RTL precomputed test-set-based approaches, such as the need for an explicit controller/datapath separation, the use of all test vectors or none from the precomputed test set for any given module, a dependence on symbolic justification (observability) paths from (to) circuit inputs (outputs) for a module, and a lack of applicability to mixed gate-level/RTL designs. Using the state-of-the-art SAT solver Zchaff, we show that our RTL test generator can outperform gate-level sequential automatic test-pattern generation (ATPG), in terms of both fault coverage and test-generation time (two-to-three orders of magnitude speedup), in comparable test-application times. Furthermore, we show that in a bilevel testing scenario, in which RTL ATPG is followed by gate-level sequential ATPG on the remaining faults, we improve the fault coverage even further, while maintaining a high speedup in test-generation time (nearly 32/spl times/) over pure gate-level sequential ATPG, at comparable test-application times.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.853700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/33596/01597388.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.853700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satisfiability-based test generation for nonseparable RTL controller-datapath circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597388/","displayDocTitle":"Satisfiability-based test generation for nonseparable RTL controller-datapath circuits","volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8805572","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597388/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satisfiability-based test generation for nonseparable RTL controller-datapath circuits","sourcePdf":"01597388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092971S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"33596","articleId":"1597388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597392,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Duluth, Duluth, MN, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Hua Tang","id":"37087213290"},{"name":"A.

Existing knowledge-base structures are first examined, and knowledge representation schemes under uncertainty are then briefly analyzed. Based on this analysis, a new knowledge representation scheme in a rule base is proposed using a belief structure. In this scheme, a rule base is designed with belief degrees embedded in all possible consequents of a rule. Such a rule base is capable of capturing vagueness, incompleteness, and nonlinear causal relationships, while traditional if-then rules can be represented as a special case. Other knowledge representation parameters such as the weights of both attributes and rules are also investigated in the scheme. In an established rule base, an input to an antecedent attribute is transformed into a belief distribution. Subsequently, inference in such a rule base is implemented using the evidential reasoning (ER) approach. The scheme is further extended to inference in hierarchical rule bases. A numerical study is provided to illustrate the potential applications of the proposed methodology.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2005.851270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/33597/01597400.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2005.851270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief rule-base inference methodology using the evidential reasoning Approach-RIMER","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Belief rule-base inference methodology using the evidential reasoning Approach-RIMER","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8867921","htmlLink":"/document/1597400/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief rule-base inference methodology using the evidential reasoning Approach-RIMER","sourcePdf":"01597400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19348S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"33597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"361","xplore-issue":"33597","articleId":"1597400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597408,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Qiu","affiliation":[" Sullivan Park Research Center, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/33597/1597408/1597408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenbin Qiu received the B.S. degree from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1998, the M.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from Iowa State University, Ames, in 2005, all in electrical engineering.","He joined the Corning Incorporated Sullivan Park Research Center, Corning, NY, in 2006.

The small-signal gain as well as the crosstalk is investigated in two different injecting schemes. Dependence on mean input power and signal frequency is studied. The study reveals a strong dependence of the small-signal gain on the direction of the data signal as compared to the pump signal. The biggest difference between both amplifier types is found in the co-propagation scheme where the RF gain shows a clear resonance in the case the gain clamping is achieved by a longitudinal laser field which results in a decrease of the small-signal gain around the resonance frequency. The behavior of the crosstalk is similar in both cases, however still showing differences due to the origin of the gain clamping, which will be discussed. The experiments confirm the results found in the numerical study in all cases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Crosstalk","Resonance","Clamps","Optical modulation","Optical amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Pump lasers","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optical amplifiers","optical modulation","optical crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optical amplifiers","gain-clamping","small-signal optical modulation","crosstalk","RF gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-optical devices","gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifier (GCSOA)","linear optical amplifier","SOA","small-signal analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.2005.864154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/33492/01597417.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2005.864154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and numerical small-signal analysis of two types of gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental and numerical small-signal analysis of two types of gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597417/","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597417/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8830133","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and numerical small-signal analysis of two types of gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01597417.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085803S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"33492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33492","articleId":"1597417","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597418,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In applications where high depth of penetration is desirable, the second factor may result in the need for sensors with impractically large dimensions. We describe a way to overcome this problem by generating a field whose effective spatial wavelength is on the order of the sensor length. The magnetic field is shaped by a distributed primary winding that consists of multiple winding segments, with the total current amplitude in each segment following a sinusoidal envelope function. The effective spatial wavelength of the imposed magnetic field may be changed dynamically by changing the excitation current pattern in the primary windings. From a modeling perspective, an advantage of this kind of magnetic field excitation is that the drive current distribution is known from the beginning, since the width of the individual windings is small compared to the wavelength and may be approximated as being infinitely narrow. This greatly simplifies numerical computation, since it makes it possible to apply fast discrete Fourier transform methods directly. We discuss first sensors with Cartesian geometry. We then discuss cylindrical geometry sensors whose models use fast Hankel transforms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic sensors","Magnetic materials","Magnetic fields","Geometry","Skin","Materials testing","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Drives","Current distribution","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetometers","magnetic sensors","magnetic fields","windings","discrete Fourier transforms","Hankel transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shaped-field magnetoquasistatic sensors","skin depth","periodic magnetic field","distributed primary winding","winding segments","sinusoidal envelope function","excitation current pattern","magnetic field excitation","drive current distribution","fast discrete Fourier transform","Cartesian geometry","cylindrical geometry sensors","fast Hankel transforms","eddy current","magnetometer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eddy current","fast Fourier transform (FFT)","Hankel transform","magnetometer","shaped field"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597433","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2005.860960","startPage":"411","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/33598/01597433.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2005.860960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597433/","displayDocTitle":"Design and modeling of shaped-field magnetoquasistatic sensors","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","volume":"42","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8973532","htmlLink":"/document/1597433/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and modeling of shaped-field magnetoquasistatic sensors","sourcePdf":"01597433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090295S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"33598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33598","articleId":"1597433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1597437,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, we analyze performance characteristics of an air-core linear PM synchronous motor by varying motor design parameters in a layer model and a d-q model of the machine. We propose a multiobjective design optimization to improve thrust, thrust ripple, and consumed magnet volume independently and simultaneously by defining a flexible objective function. A genetic algorithm is employed to search for optimal designs. The results confirm that desirable thrust mean and substantial reduction in magnet volume and thrust ripple can be achieved. We draw several design conclusions from the motor analysis and design optimization.

High-level, localized RFI can be easily identified by its unnatural appearance in brightness temperature imagery. Low-level or persistent RFI can be much more difficult to identify and filter out. The agile digital detector (ADD) can discriminate between RFI and natural thermal emission signals by directly measuring higher order moments of the signal than the variance that is traditionally measured. After detection, the ADD then uses spectral filtering methods to selectively remove the RFI. ADD performance is experimentally verified in controlled laboratory tests and in the field near a commercial air traffic control radar. High-level RFI is easily identified and removed. Very low level RFI contamination, with power levels as low as the radiometric measurement uncertainty of the radiometer, is also shown to be reliably detected and removed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency interference","Microwave radiometry","Detectors","Radiofrequency identification","Pollution measurement","Brightness temperature","Radar detection","Radio frequency","Interference elimination","Microwave measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency interference","microwave imaging","radiometry","remote sensing","geophysical signal processing","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave radiometry","radio spectrum management","RFI detection","agile digital detector","radiofrequency interference","brightness temperature imagery","natural thermal emission signal","spectral filtering","commercial air traffic control radar","radiometric measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave radiometry","radio spectrum management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2005.861411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/33599/01597474.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2005.861411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RFI detection and mitigation for microwave radiometry with an agile digital detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RFI detection and mitigation for microwave radiometry with an agile digital detector","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597474/","volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597474/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8850944","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RFI detection and mitigation for microwave radiometry with an agile digital detector","sourcePdf":"01597474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076187S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"33599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"33599","articleId":"1597474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1597478,"authors":[{"name":"M.Q.

Forward and inverse models were incorporated in the HNN to support a new reflectance constraint added to the energy function. The value of the function was calculated based on a linear mixture model. In addition, a new model was used to calculate the local endmember spectra for the reflectance constraint. A set of simulated images was used to test the new technique.

Beamspace processing involves passing the data through a linear transformation that reduces the data dimension prior to applying a desired statistical signal processing algorithm. This process generally reduces the data requirements of the subsequent algorithm. We present one approach for designing beamspace transformations that are optimized to preserve source activity located within a given region of interest and show that substantial reductions in dimension are obtained with negligible signal loss. Beamspace versions of maximum likelihood dipole fitting, MUSIC, and minimum variance beamforming source localization algorithms are presented. The performance improvement offered by the beamspace approach with limited data is demonstrated by bootstrapping somatosensory data to evaluate the variability of the source location estimates obtained with each algorithm. The quantitative benefits of beamspace processing depend on the algorithm, signal to noise ratio, and amount of data. Dramatic performance improvements are obtained in scenarios with low signal to noise ratio and a small number of independent data samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","volume":"53","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"8808704","pubMedId":"16532769","publicationDate":"March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597493/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MEG and EEG source localization in beamspace","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MEG and EEG source localization in beamspace","sourcePdf":"01597493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069882S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"33600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"33600","articleId":"1597493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1597499,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

A simplified three-state system is used: Wakefulness (W), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (R), and non-REM sleep (S). The system scores the sleep stages in standard 30-s epochs. A number of features associated with the epoch RR-intervals, an inductance plethysmography estimate of rib cage respiratory effort, and an electrocardiogram-derived respiration (EDR) signal were investigated. A subject-specific quadratic discriminant classifier was trained, randomly choosing 20% of the subject's epochs (in appropriate proportions of W, S and R) as the training data. The remaining 80% of epochs were presented to the classifier for testing. An estimated classification accuracy of 79% (Cohen's /spl kappa/ value of 0.56) was achieved. When a similar subject-independent classifier was trained, using epochs from all other subjects as the training data, a drop in classification accuracy to 67% (/spl kappa/=0.32) was observed. The subjects were further broken in groups of low apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) and high AHI and the experiments repeated. The subject-specific classifier performed better on subjects with low AHI than high AHI; the performance of the subject-independent classifier is not correlated with AHI. For comparison an electroencephalograms (EEGs)-based classifier was trained utilizing several standard EEG features. The subject-specific classifier yielded an accuracy of 87% (/spl kappa/=0.75), and an accuracy of 84% (/spl kappa/=0.68) was obtained for the subject-independent classifier, indicating that EEG features are quite robust across subjects. We conclude that the cardiorespiratory signals provide moderate sleep-staging accuracy, however, features exhibit significant subject dependence which presents potential limits to the use of these signals in a general subject-independent sleep staging system.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.869773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/33600/01597499.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.869773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cardiorespiratory-based sleep staging in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597499/","displayDocTitle":"Cardiorespiratory-based sleep staging in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea","volume":"53","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8808710","pubMedId":"16532775","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597499/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cardiorespiratory-based sleep staging in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea","sourcePdf":"01597499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095444S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"33600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"33600","articleId":"1597499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":1597509,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

In this paper, the motion artifacts were reduced by exploiting the quasi-periodicity of the PPG signal and the independence between the PPG and the motion artifact signals. The combination of independent component analysis and block interleaving with low-pass filtering can reduce the motion artifacts under the condition of general dual-wavelength measurement. Experiments with synthetic and real data were performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2005.869784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.869784","startPage":"566","endPage":"568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/33600/01597509.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion artifact reduction in photoplethysmography using independent component analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Motion artifact reduction in photoplethysmography using independent component analysis","volume":"53","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8808720","pubMedId":"16532785","publicationDate":"March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597509/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion artifact reduction in photoplethysmography using independent component analysis","sourcePdf":"01597509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041794S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"33600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"265","xplore-issue":"33600","articleId":"1597509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1597521,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

The bake experiment at 250/spl deg/C before and after program/erase cycles indicates the cell not only free of extrinsic defects in the manufacturing process but also experiencing excellent retention characteristics.

The BO-TMA and DB-TMA problems are nontrivial because the measurement equations are nonlinearly related to the target location parameters. The pseudolinear formulation provides a linear estimator solution, but the resulting location estimate is biased. The instrumental variable method and the numerical maximum likelihood approach can eliminate the bias. Their convergence behavior, however, is not easy to control. This paper proposes an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the tracking problem. The proposed method applies least squares minimization on the pseudolinear equations with a quadratic constraint on the unknown parameters. The resulting estimator is shown to be solving the generalized eigenvalue problem. The proposed solution does not require initial guesses and does not have convergence problems. Sequential forms of the proposed algorithms for both BO-TMA and DB-TMA are derived. The sequential algorithms improve the estimation accuracy as a new measurement arrives and do not require generalized eigenvalue decomposition for solution update. The proposed estimator achieves the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) asymptotically for Gaussian noise before the thresholding effect occurs.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861776","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597549.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"809","endPage":"822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asymptotically unbiased estimator for bearings-only and Doppler-bearing target motion analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"An asymptotically unbiased estimator for bearings-only and Doppler-bearing target motion analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597549/","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1597549/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812537","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asymptotically unbiased estimator for bearings-only and Doppler-bearing target motion analysis","sourcePdf":"01597549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079954S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":1597550,"authors":[{"name":"E.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the statistical MIMO is being proposed for radar. The fundamental difference between statistical MIMO and other radar array systems is that the latter seek to maximize the coherent processing gain, while statistical MIMO radar capitalizes on the diversity of target scattering to improve radar performance. Coherent processing is made possible by highly correlated signals at the receiver array, whereas in statistical MIMO radar, the signals received by the array elements are uncorrelated. Radar targets generally consist of many small elemental scatterers that are fused by the radar waveform and the processing at the receiver, to result in echoes with fluctuating amplitude and phase. It is well known that in conventional radar, slow fluctuations of the target radar cross section (RCS) result in target fades that degrade radar performance. By spacing the antenna elements at the transmitter and at the receiver such that the target angular spread is manifested, the MIMO radar can exploit the spatial diversity of target scatterers opening the way to a variety of new techniques that can improve radar performance. This paper focuses on the application of the target spatial diversity to improve detection performance. The optimal detector in the Neyman\u2013Pearson sense is developed and analyzed for the statistical MIMO radar. It is shown that the optimal detector consists of noncoherent processing of the receiver sensors' outputs and that for cases of practical interest, detection performance is superior to that obtained through coherent processing. An optimal detector invariant to the signal and noise levels is also developed and analyzed. In this case as well, statistical MIMO radar provides great improvements over other types of array radars.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","volume":"54","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597550/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Diversity in Radars\u2014Models and Detection Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Diversity in Radars\u2014Models and Detection Performance","sourcePdf":"01597550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091929S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1000","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":1597552,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Brennan's rule for the space-time clutter covariance matrix rank is extended to monostatic linear arrays with arbitrary intersensor spacing, distorted linear arrays and bistatic geometries. It is shown that both distortion in the array geometry and bistatic operation increase the clutter rank and cause the space-time clutter covariance matrix to become range dependent. This results in lower output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the same number of adaptive degrees of freedom and reduced available sample support. This motivates the development of the STINT technique aimed at compensating for the clutter rank inflation, while also making the clutter statistics appear more stationary across range. More specifically, a linear transformation is designed that maps the received clutter across space and time to that which would be received by a \"virtual\" monostatic side-looking ULA. By mapping the data to form a reduced rank clutter covariance matrix, fewer snapshots are needed for a statistically stable matrix inversion as required in STAP, thereby improving the short observation time performance. Simulation results for a typical airborne radar scenario indicate up to 10-dB SINR improvement can be obtained using STINT with limited sample support.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.862941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597552.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"860","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.862941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint space-time interpolation for distorted linear and bistatic array geometries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Joint space-time interpolation for distorted linear and bistatic array geometries","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1597552/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812540","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint space-time interpolation for distorted linear and bistatic array geometries","sourcePdf":"01597552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096268S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597553,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

The proposed algorithm is based on decomposition of H as the matrix product H=WQ/sup H/, where W is a whitening matrix and Q is unitary rotation matrix. The whitening matrix W can be estimated blind using only received data while Q is estimated exclusively from pilot symbols. Employing the results for the complex-constrained Cramer-Rao Bound (CC-CRB), it is shown that the lower bound on the mean-square error (MSE) in the estimate of H is directly proportional to its number of unconstrained parameters. Utilizing the bounds, the semi-blind scheme is shown to be very efficient when the number of receive antennas is greater than or equal to the number of transmit antennas. Closed-form expressions for the CRB of the semi-blind technique are presented. Algorithms for channel estimation based on the decomposition are also developed and analyzed. In particular, the properties of the constrained maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator of Q for an orthogonal pilot sequence is examined, and the constrained estimator for a general pilot sequence is derived. In addition, a Gaussian likelihood function is considered for the joint optimization of W and Q, and its performance is studied. Simulation results are presented to support the algorithms and analysis, and they demonstrate improved performance compared to exclusively training-based estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597553.pdf","startPage":"861","endPage":"869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.862908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.862908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whitening-rotation-based semi-blind MIMO channel estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Matrix decomposition","Receiving antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Maximum likelihood estimation","Partial transmit sequences","Cramer-Rao bounds","Transmitting antennas","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO systems","fading channels","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","maximum likelihood estimation","Gaussian processes","antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["whitening-rotation-based algorithm","semiblind MIMO channel estimation","flat-fading multiinput multioutput channel matrix","unitary rotation matrix","blind estimation","complex-constrained Cramer-Rao bound","mean-square error estimation","MSE","transmit antennas","receive antennas","maximum-likelihood estimator","orthogonal pilot sequence","Gaussian likelihood function","training-based estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","constrained Cramer\u2013Rao bound","constrained estimation","Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)","iterative general maximum likelihood (IGML)","multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","orthogonal pilot maximum-likelihood (OPML)","unitary"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Whitening-rotation-based semi-blind MIMO channel estimation","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1597553/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812541","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whitening-rotation-based semi-blind MIMO channel estimation","sourcePdf":"01597553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085945S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597554,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For more than a decade, there has been an increasing interest in optimal WL filters in radiocommunications contexts involving rectilinear signals such as binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signals. In particular, it has been pointed out that single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) may be performed by such filters in the context of BPSK cellular networks. Recently, it has been shown that, by a simple algebraic operation of demodulation on the baseband signal, the minimum shift keying (MSK) and Gaussian MSK (GMSK) modulations can be made to approximately correspond to a BPSK modulation, allowing the application of the SAIC concept to the GSM cellular network at the mobile level, being currently studied for standardization, and offering significant improvements of the network's capacity. Despite the increasing interest in optimal WL filters in rectilinear or quasi-rectilinear contexts, many questions about their behavior and their performance have still arisen.

In the case of multiple LS channel estimates, the best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) scheme for their linear combining is developed and studied.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.863008","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597555.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.863008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training-based MIMO channel estimation: a study of estimator tradeoffs and optimal training signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Training-based MIMO channel estimation: a study of estimator tradeoffs and optimal training signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597555/","publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8812543","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597555/","volume":"54","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training-based MIMO channel estimation: a study of estimator tradeoffs and optimal training signals","sourcePdf":"01597555.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080058S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"579","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":1597559,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

The channel input is a training vector superimposed on a linearly precoded vector of symbols. A block-fading frequency-selective multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel is considered. To highlight the tradeoffs between training and data symbols, the Fisher information matrix (FIM) is derived under two circumstances: the random parameter vector to be estimated contains 1) only fading channel coefficients and 2) unknown data symbols as well as the channel coefficients. While strategy 1 corresponds to the receiver structure in which the channel is estimated initially and the channel measurement is utilized to retrieve the data symbols, strategy 2 corresponds to the structure in which channel and symbol estimations are performed jointly. The interesting outcome of the study in this paper is that minimizing the channel Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for strategies 1 and 2 under a total average transmit power constraint leads to different affine precoder design guidelines.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.863031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597560.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.863031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Everything you always wanted to know about training: guidelines derived using the affine precoding framework and the CRB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597560/","displayDocTitle":"Everything you always wanted to know about training: guidelines derived using the affine precoding framework and the CRB","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812548","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597560/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Everything you always wanted to know about training: guidelines derived using the affine precoding framework and the CRB","sourcePdf":"01597560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15811S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597561,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

In this paper, a new DA architecture called NEDA is proposed, aimed at reducing the cost metrics of power and area while maintaining high speed and accuracy in digital signal processing (DSP) applications. Mathematical analysis proves that DA can implement inner product of vectors in the form of two's complement numbers using only additions, followed by a small number of shifts at the final stage. Comparative studies show that NEDA outperforms widely used approaches such as multiply/accumulate (MAC) and DA in many aspects. Being a high-speed architecture free of ROM, multiplication, and subtraction, NEDA can also expose the redundancy existing in the adder array consisting of entries of 0 and 1. A hardware compression scheme is introduced to generate a butterfly structure with minimum number of additions. NEDA-based architectures for 8 /spl times/ 8 discrete cosine transform (DCT) core are presented as an example. Savings exceeding 88% are achieved, when the compression scheme is applied along with NEDA. Finite word-length simulations demonstrate the viability and excellent performance of NEDA.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.862755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597561.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.862755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NEDA: a low-power high-performance DCT architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597561/","displayDocTitle":"NEDA: a low-power high-performance DCT architecture","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812549","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597561/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NEDA: a low-power high-performance DCT architecture","sourcePdf":"01597561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111924S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597562,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33602/1597562/1597562-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang Xu received the B.

We provide closed-form expressions for transmitter-receiver pairs that simultaneously minimize the arithmetic mean squared error (MSE) at the decision point (assuming perfect feedback), the geometric MSE, and the bit error rate of a uniformly bit-loaded system at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios. Separate expressions apply for the \"zero-forcing\" and \"minimum MSE\" (MMSE) decision feedback structures. In the MMSE case, the proposed design also maximizes the Gaussian mutual information and suggests that one can approach the capacity of the block transmission system using (independent instances of) the same (Gaussian) code for each element of the block. Our simulation studies indicate that the proposed transceivers perform significantly better than standard transceivers and that they retain their performance advantages in the presence of error propagation.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","startPage":"965","endPage":"978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of block transceivers with decision feedback detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of block transceivers with decision feedback detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812550","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597562/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of block transceivers with decision feedback detection","sourcePdf":"01597562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142788S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1597563,"authors":[{"name":"O.

KSP is a recently proposed block transmission technique where short sequences of known symbols acting as guard bands are inserted between successive blocks of data symbols. This paper proposes three novel channel estimation methods that allow for an accurate estimation of the time-varying transmission channel solely relying on the knowledge of the redundant symbols introduced by the KSP transmission scheme. The first method is a direct adaptive one while the others rely on a recently proposed model, the Basis Expansion Model (BEM), where the doubly selective channel is approximated with high accuracy using a limited number of complex exponentials. An important characteristic of the proposed methods is that they exploit all the received symbols that contain contributions from the training sequences and blindly filter out the contribution of the unknown surrounding data symbols. Besides these channel identification methods, the classical KSP equalizers are adapted to the context of doubly selective channels, which allows evaluation of the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of a KSP transmission system relying on the proposed channel estimation methods in the context of doubly selective channels. Simulation results show that KSP transmission is indeed a suitable transmission technique toward the delivery of high data rates to users experiencing a high mobility, when adapted KSP equalizers are used in combination with the proposed channel estimation methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.862754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597563.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.862754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","startPage":"979","endPage":"990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation and equalization of doubly selective channels using known symbol padding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation and equalization of doubly selective channels using known symbol padding","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812551","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597563/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation and equalization of doubly selective channels using known symbol padding","sourcePdf":"01597563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083561S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1597564,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The main property of this new modulation scheme is the ability to estimate and track the channel variations semi-blindly using order-one statistics of the received signal. Compared with known cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) pilot-symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM) schemes, the pilot overhead is avoided: The channel estimation is performed based on the exploitation of pseudorandomly weighted postfix sequences replacing the guard interval contents of CP-OFDM. PRP-OFDM is shown to be of advantage if the target application requires 1) a minimum pilot overhead, 2) low-complexity channel tracking (e.g., high mobility context), and 3) adjustable receiver complexity/performance trade-offs (available due to the similarities of PRP-OFDM to the zero-padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) modulation scheme) without requiring any feedback loop to the transmitter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pseudorandom postfix OFDM modulator - semi-blind channel estimation and equalization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.863012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597565.pdf","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.863012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","displayDocTitle":"A pseudorandom postfix OFDM modulator - semi-blind channel estimation and equalization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1597565/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812553","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pseudorandom postfix OFDM modulator - semi-blind channel estimation and equalization","sourcePdf":"01597565.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084782S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597565","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597566,"authors":[{"name":"Ruixin Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33602/1597566/1597566-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruixin Niu (M'04) received the B.S. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1994, the M.S. degree from the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 2001, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY.

Previous development relies on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, acquiring channel information may be too costly for resource constrained sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a new likelihood ratio (LR)-based fusion rule which requires only the knowledge of channel statistics instead of instantaneous CSI. Based on the assumption that all the sensors have the same detection performance and the same channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we show that when the channel SNR is low, this fusion rule reduces to a statistic in the form of an equal gain combiner (EGC), which explains why EGC is a very good choice with low or medium SNR; at high-channel SNR, it is equivalent to the Chair-Varshney fusion rule. Performance evaluation shows that the new fusion rule exhibits only slight performance degradation compared with the optimal LR-based fusion rule using instantaneous CSI.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.863033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597566.pdf","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.863033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of decisions transmitted over Rayleigh fading channels in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597566/","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of decisions transmitted over Rayleigh fading channels in wireless sensor networks","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812554","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597566/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of decisions transmitted over Rayleigh fading channels in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01597566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079991S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1597567,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

A linear nonredundant block precoding scheme is applied at the input of the OFDM system. The precoding spreads the symbols of each user over all subcarriers, thus increasing multipath diversity. At the same time, it introduces a structure to the transmitted symbols, which is exploited at the receiver to estimate the channel in a blind fashion. The proposed channel estimation approach employs computationally simple cross-correlation operations and yields the channel up to a diagonal ambiguity.

In this paper, we study the mean-square performance of a convex combination of two transversal filters. The individual filters are independently adapted using their own error signals, while the combination is adapted by means of a stochastic gradient algorithm in order to minimize the error of the overall structure. General expressions are derived that show that the method is universal with respect to the component filters, i.e., in steady-state, it performs at least as well as the best component filter. Furthermore, when the correlation between the a priori errors of the components is low enough, their combination is able to outperform both of them. Using energy conservation relations, we specialize the results to a combination of least mean-square filters operating both in stationary and in nonstationary scenarios. We also show how the universality of the scheme can be exploited to design filters with improved tracking performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean-square performance of a convex combination of two adaptive filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.863126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597571.pdf","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.863126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Mean-square performance of a convex combination of two adaptive filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1597571/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8812559","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean-square performance of a convex combination of two adaptive filters","sourcePdf":"01597571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075248S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"285","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1597574,"authors":[{"name":"Jwo-Yuh Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33602/1597574/1597574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jwo-Yuh Wu (M'04) received the B.S., M.S. degree, and Ph.D. degrees, all in electrical and control engineering, from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1996, 1998, and 2002, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University.

The proposed approach relies on the block system model and exploits the circulant channel matrix structure after the cyclic prefix is removed. It is shown that the set of linear equations relating the autocorrelation matrix of the block received signal and the product channel coefficients can be rearranged into one with a distinctive block circulant structure. The identification equations thus obtained lead to a very simple identifiability condition, as well as a natural formulation of the optimal modulating sequence design problem which, based on the block circulant signal structure, can be cast as a constrained quadratic problem that allows for a simple closed-form solution. The impact of the optimal modulating sequence on the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is investigated. Also, it is shown that the optimal sequence results in a consistent channel estimate irrespective of white noise perturbation. Pairwise error probability analysis is used to examine the equalization performance and based on which several design tradeoffs are discussed. Simulation results are used for illustrating the performance of the proposed method.","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33602/01597574.pdf","startPage":"1114","endPage":"1130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.863041","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.863041","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597574","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Equations","Peak to average power ratio","Autocorrelation","Signal design","Signal processing","Closed-form solution","White noise","Pairwise error probability","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","blind equalisers","matrix algebra","channel estimation","white noise","error statistics","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic-modulation-based blind channel identification","single-carrier block transmission","frequency-domain equalization","block system model","channel matrix structure","cyclic prefix","linear equations","autocorrelation matrix","identification equations","optimal modulating sequence design","peak-to-average power ratio","pairwise error probability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind channel identification","circulant matrix","frequency-domain equalization (FDE)","periodic modulation precoder","single-carrier (SC) block transmission","transmitter-induced cyclostationarity (TIC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Periodic-modulation-based blind channel identification for single-carrier block transmission with frequency-domain equalization","accessionNumber":"8812562","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2006","publicationDate":"March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1597574/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic-modulation-based blind channel identification for single-carrier block transmission with frequency-domain equalization","sourcePdf":"01597574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132767S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33602","articleId":"1597574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1597575,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Nucleic-acid-based detection of viral particles in whole blood requires separation of viral particles from blood cells followed by extraction, amplification, and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, three microfluidic chips have been independently shown to be capable of performing each critical step. Separation of viral particles involves a flow-through, shear-type microfilter chip that can handle large volume of blood. The remaining chips, although developed for genomic DNA, have been adopted for extraction and amplification of viral RNA. In the extraction chip, protein coatings around viral particles are chemically broken to liberate viral RNA which can reversibly bind to the chip surface under high-salt conditions. Viral RNA can be eluted out with a low-salt buffer after removal of unwanted debris. In the amplification chip, viral RNA is first transcribed into cDNA and then multiplied exponentially in copies by a continuous, isothermal, enzyme-based technique known as Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA). The amplicons are detected on the same chip using DNA probes conjugated with horse radish peroxide (HRP) for colorimetry","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microfluidic chips for viral RNA extraction & detection","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2005 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2005.1597634","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2005 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10646/33608/01597634.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2005.1597634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1597634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2005-Nov. 3 2005","displayDocTitle":"Microfluidic chips for viral RNA extraction & detection","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1597634/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8913735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microfluidic chips for viral RNA extraction & detection","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01597634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082424S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2005-Nov. 3 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10646","isNumber":"33608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10646","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33608","articleId":"1597634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1597646,"authors":[{"name":"B.C.

In air pressure, we focus on the damping caused by the fluid drag force. A frequency dependent fluid damping model is proposed and experimentally validated. At high vacuum, thermo-elastic damping (TED) is demonstrated to be the main damping source experimentally, for frequency range from 10Khz to 2MHz and up to 6 resonant modes.

However, the mechanical gain structure introduces a nonlinear characteristic, which degrades the device's linearity. A 6% nonlinearity was observed at 1000 micro-strain. Therefore, further research efforts are required for improvements. This paper presents an in-depth study of the buckled beams characteristics on nonlinearity analytically and by FEA. The accuracy of the modeling is verified by the measurements. The analysis results show the tradeoff between mechanical gain and linearity, and can be improved by device geometrical optimization. Furthermore, the accuracy of the modeling results in predictable device characteristics, allowing the development of a 2nd order nonlinear electronic compensation method to achieve an overall system performance.

The presented interface circuit directly converts a capacitance to a digital word, at high resolution (2aF/sqrtHz), high linearity (100ppm) and high accuracy (4fF). The circuit is based on a novel modification to a standard switched-cap Sigma-Delta modulator. The fixed input capacitor in the switched capacitor front-end is replaced by the external variable sensor capacitance, and a fixed voltage is applied in place of the normal variable voltage input. A fully differential circuit is used in conjunction with a switching technique which allows for cancellation of leakage current errors.

The developed system showed high recognition probability to discriminate various single odors to its high generality properties; however, the system had a limitation in recognizing the fragrances mixture. In order to improve the performance of the proposed system, development of the sensor and other neural network are being sought. This paper explains the improvement of the capability of that system. In this experiment, the improvement is conducted not only by replacing the last hardware system from 4 quartz resonator-basic resonance frequencies 10 MHz with new 16 quartz resonator-basic resonance frequencies 20 MHz, but also by replacing the pattern classifier from back propagation (BP) neural network with variance of back propagation, probabilistic neural network (PNN) and optimized-PNN. The purpose of the recent study is to construct a new artificial odor discrimination system for recognizing fragrance mixtures. The using of new sensing system and employing various neural networks have produced higher capability to recognize the fragrance mixtures compared to the earlier mentioned system","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2005.1597877","pdfPath":"/iel5/10646/33608/01597877.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2005 IEEE","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2005 IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2005.1597877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized probabilistic neural networks in recognizing fragrance mixtures using higher number of sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1597877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2005-Nov. 3 2005","displayDocTitle":"Optimized probabilistic neural networks in recognizing fragrance mixtures using higher number of sensors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","accessionNumber":"8913978","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1597877/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized probabilistic neural networks in recognizing fragrance mixtures using higher number of sensors","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01597877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062375S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2005-Nov. 3 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10646","isNumber":"33608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33608","articleId":"1597877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1597908,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.A.

The filter consists of two heaters and a thermopile implemented in the substrate of a standard CMOS chip. In the thermal domain, this filter has a low-pass characteristic, whose phase shift is determined solely by its physical dimensions and by the thermal diffusion constant of silicon. Since the latter is temperature dependent and essentially process independent, the oscillator's frequency can be used as a well-defined, microprocessor-compatible, measure of temperature.

We select one small aspect of a typical chip multiprocessor (CMP) system to study in detail, a single CMP router switch. To start, we develop a unified model of faults, based on the time-tested bathtub curve. Using this convenient abstraction, we analyze the reliability versus area tradeoff across a wide spectrum of CMP switch designs, ranging from unprotected designs to fully protected designs with online repair and recovery capabilities. Protection is considered at multiple levels from the entire system down through arbitrary partitions of the design. To better understand the impact of these faults, we evaluate our CMP switch designs using circuit-level timing on detailed physical layouts. Our experimental results are quite illuminating. We find that designs are attainable that can tolerate a larger number of defects with less overhead than naive triple-modular redundancy, using domain-specific techniques such as end-to-end error detection, resource sparing, automatic circuit decomposition, and iterative diagnosis and reconfiguration.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598108","publicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10647/33614/01598108.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BulletProof: a defect-tolerant CMP switch architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1598108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598108/","displayDocTitle":"BulletProof: a defect-tolerant CMP switch architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8836195","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598108/","conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BulletProof: a defect-tolerant CMP switch architecture","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01598108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060706S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10647","isNumber":"33614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10647","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"33614","articleId":"1598108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1598109,"authors":[{"name":"Yingmin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"lastName":"Yingmin Li","id":"37279895700"},{"name":"B.

The results show the importance of joint optimization. Thermal constraints dominate other physical constraints such as pin-bandwidth and power delivery, demonstrating the importance of considering thermal constraints while optimizing these other parameters. For aggressive cooling solutions, reducing power density is at least as important as reducing total power, while for low-cost cooling solutions, reducing total power is more important. Finally, the paper shows the challenges of accommodating both CPU-bound and memory-bound workloads on the same design. Their respective preferences for more cores and larger caches lead to increasingly irreconcilable configurations as area and other constraints are relaxed; rather than accommodating a happy medium, the extra resources simply encourage more extreme optimization points.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10647/33614/01598109.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1598109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMP design space exploration subject to physical constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space exploration","Voltage","Cooling","Throughput","Frequency","Pipelines","Constraint optimization","Design optimization","Computer science","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","logic design","computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMP design space exploration","physical constraints","multidimensional design space","chip multiprocessors","joint optimization","thermal constraints","pin-bandwidth","power delivery","aggressive cooling solutions","power density","CPU-bound workloads","memory-bound workloads"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"CMP design space exploration subject to physical constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598109/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8836196","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMP design space exploration subject to physical constraints","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01598109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090213S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10647","isNumber":"33614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10647","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"33614","articleId":"1598109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1598110,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

Doing so usually requires tedious manual parallelization or re-design to encapsulate processors. This paper presents techniques to perform automated simulator parallelization and hardware integration for CMP structural models. We show that automated parallelization can achieve an 7.60 speedup for a 16-processor CMP model on a conventional 4-processor shared-memory multiprocessor.

Nonetheless, parallel computation of a single application is critical in light of the expanding performance demands of important future workloads. This work addresses the problem of dynamically optimizing power consumption of a parallel application that executes on a many-core CMP under a given performance constraint. The optimization space is two-dimensional, allowing changes in the number of active processors and applying dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. We demonstrate that the particular optimum operating point depends nontrivially on the power-performance characteristics of the CMP, the application's behavior, and the particular performance target. We present simple, low-overhead heuristics for dynamic optimization that significantly cut down on the search effort along both dimensions of the optimization space. In our evaluation of several parallel applications with different performance targets, these heuristics quickly lock on a configuration that yields optimal power savings in virtually all cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10647/33614/01598114.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"87","publicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1598114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic power-performance adaptation of parallel computation on chip multiprocessors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concurrent computing","System-on-a-chip","Parallel processing","Energy consumption","Frequency","Circuits","Yarn","Runtime environment","Voltage","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","microprocessor chips","power consumption","parallel processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic power-performance adaptation","parallel computation","chip multiprocessors","CMP","power consumption","voltage scaling","frequency scaling","power-performance characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic power-performance adaptation of parallel computation on chip multiprocessors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598114/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8836201","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic power-performance adaptation of parallel computation on chip multiprocessors","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01598114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070708S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10647","isNumber":"33614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10647","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"33614","articleId":"1598114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1598115,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These applications are important in defining the design and performance decisions of future high performance microprocessors. This paper presents a detailed data-sharing analysis and chip-multiprocessor (CMP) cache study of several multithreaded data-mining bioinformatics workloads. For a CMP with a three-level cache hierarchy, we model the last-level of the cache hierarchy as either multiple private caches or a single cache shared amongst different cores of the CMP. Our experiments show that the bioinformatics workloads exhibit significant data-sharing - 50-95% of the data cache is shared by the different threads of the workload. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of data cache shared, for some workloads, as many as 98% of the accesses to the last-level cache are to shared data cache lines. Additionally, the amount of data-sharing exhibited by the workloads is a function of the total cache size available - the larger the data cache the better the sharing behavior. Thus, partitioning the available last-level cache silicon area into multiple private caches can cause applications to lose their inherent data-sharing behavior. For the workloads in this study, a shared 32 MB last-level cache is able to capture a tremendous amount of data-sharing and outperform a 32 MB private cache configuration by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, with shared last-level caches, the bandwidth demands beyond the last-level cache can be reduced by factors of 3-625 when compared to private last-level caches.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598115","publicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10647/33614/01598115.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Last level cache (LLC) performance of data mining workloads on a CMP - a case study of parallel bioinformatics workloads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Last level cache (LLC) performance of data mining workloads on a CMP - a case study of parallel bioinformatics workloads","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1598115/","accessionNumber":"8836202","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Last level cache (LLC) performance of data mining workloads on a CMP - a case study of parallel bioinformatics workloads","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01598115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071831S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10647","isNumber":"33614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10647","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"33614","articleId":"1598115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1598116,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

This result extends to DRAM rows, or pages (retention time of a page is defined as the shortest retention time among its constituent cells). Currently, a single worst-case refresh period is selected based on the page with the shortest retention time. Even with refresh optimized for room temperature, the worst page limits the safe refresh period to no longer than 500 ms. Yet, 99% and 85% of pages have retention times above 3 seconds and 10 seconds, respectively. We propose retention-aware placement in DRAM (RAPID), novel software approaches that can exploit off-the-shelf DRAMs to reduce refresh power to vanishingly small levels approaching non-volatile memory. The key idea is to favor longer-retention pages over shorter-retention pages when allocating DRAM pages. This allows selecting a single refresh period that depends on the shortest-retention page among populated pages, instead of the shortest-retention page overall. We explore three versions of RAPID and observe refresh energy savings of 83%, 93%, and 95%, relative to the best temperature-compensated refresh. RAPID with off-the-shelf DRAM also approaches the energy levels of idealized techniques that require custom DRAM support.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598122","publicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10647/33614/01598122.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retention-aware placement in DRAM (RAPID): software methods for quasi-non-volatile DRAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1598122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Retention-aware placement in DRAM (RAPID): software methods for quasi-non-volatile DRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598122/","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8836209","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598122/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retention-aware placement in DRAM (RAPID): software methods for quasi-non-volatile DRAM","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01598122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054456S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10647","isNumber":"33614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10647","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"33614","articleId":"1598122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1598124,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Youngjae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293247700"},{"name":"Sudhanva Gurumurthi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhanva","lastName":"Gurumurthi","id":"37282414100"},{"name":"Anand Sivasubramaniam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Sivasubramaniam","id":"37273174700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9368-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"1598124","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Disk drives","Thermal management","Computer science","Power system management","Cooling","Thermal engineering","Performance analysis","Temperature distribution","Energy management","Environmental management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","disc storage","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance-temperature interaction","disk I/O characteristics","server workload","storage system","microbenchmark","temperature optimization","thermal profile","disk drive","dynamic thermal management"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the first infrastructure for integrated studies of the performance and thermal behavior of storage systems.

We designed and implemented a highly scalable parallel file I/O architecture for Blue Gene/L, which leverages the benefit of the hierarchical and functional partitioning design of the system software with separate computational and I/O cores. The architecture exploits the scalability aspect of GPFS (General Parallel File System) at the backend, while using MPI I/O as an interface between the application I/O and the file system. We demonstrate the impact of our high performance I/O solution for Blue Gene/L with a comprehensive evaluation that consists of a number of widely used parallel I/O benchmarks and I/O intensive applications. Our design and implementation is not only able to deliver at least one order of magnitude speed up in terms of I/O bandwidth for a real-scale application HOMME (achieving aggregate bandwidth of 1.8 GB/Sec and 2.3 GB/Sec for write and read accesses, respectively), but also supports high-level parallel I/O data interfaces such as parallel HDF5 and parallel NetCDF scaling up to a large number of processors.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598125","publicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10647/33614/01598125.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance file I/O for the Blue Gene/L supercomputer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1598125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598125/","displayDocTitle":"High performance file I/O for the Blue Gene/L supercomputer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"8836212","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598125/","conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance file I/O for the Blue Gene/L supercomputer","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01598125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080405S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10647","isNumber":"33614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10647","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"33614","articleId":"1598125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1598134,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

Implementing these properties includes providing data version management for the simultaneous storage of both new (visible if the transaction commits) and old (retained if the transaction aborts) values. Most (hardware) TM systems leave old values \"in place\" (the target memory address) and buffer new values elsewhere until commit. This makes aborts fast, but penalizes (the much more frequent) commits. In this paper, we present a new implementation of transactional memory, log-based transactional memory (LogTM), that makes commits fast by storing old values to a per-thread log in cacheable virtual memory and storing new values in place. LogTM makes two additional contributions. First, LogTM extends a MOESI directory protocol to enable both fast conflict detection on evicted blocks and fast commit (using lazy cleanup). Second, LogTM handles aborts in (library) software with little performance penalty. Evaluations running micro- and SPLASH-2 benchmarks on a 32-way multiprocessor support our decision to optimize for commit by showing that only 1-2% of transactions abort.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598134","publicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Twelfth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2006.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10647/33614/01598134.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LogTM: log-based transactional memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"LogTM: log-based transactional memory","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1598134/","accessionNumber":"8836218","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LogTM: log-based transactional memory","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01598134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079245S","chronDate":"11-15 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10647","isNumber":"33614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10647","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"33614","articleId":"1598134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1598145,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The main task of these applications is to identify (and track) moving targets. Usually, these applications requires that a large number of parameters is tuned in order to work properly. In the traffic monitoring application we have developed about thirty parameters concerning the detection algorithm have been considered as to be optimized. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are an optimization technique which involves a search from a population of solutions rather than from a single point. Although they usually are very time-consuming, they owe a high intrinsic parallelism.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a high performance, fully parallel matrix multiplication core. The core is parameterised and scalable in terms of the matrices' dimensions (row and column number) and the input data word length. Fully floorplanned FPGA configurations are generated automatically, from high-level descriptions of the matrix multiplication operation, in the form of EDIF netlists in less than 1 sec. These are specifically optimised for Xilinx Virtex FPGA chips. By exploiting the abundance of logic resources in Xilinx Virtex FPGAs (look-up tables, fast carry logic, shift registers, flip flops etc.), a fully parallel implementation of the matrix multiplier core has been achieved; with a full matrix result being generated every clock cycle.

The image coprocessor high level instruction set is based on the operators of image algebra. Central to this Instruction set are the five core neighbourhood operations of image algebra: convolution, additive maximum, additive minimum, multiplicative maximum and multiplicative minimum. These are parameterised in terms of the neighbourhood operation's window coefficients, window size and image size. Handel-C language was used to design the image coprocessor with a fully tested prototype on Celoxica Virtex-E based RC1000-PP PCI board.

Increasing the number of parallel transmission reduces the data rate that each individual carrier must convey and that lengthens the symbol period. This is extremely useful in environments where multipath fading is high. Most third generation mobile phone systems are using code division multiple access (CDMA) as their modulation technique. Hence, this paper compares the performance of OFDM with that of CDMA. The analysis of bit error rate (BER) performance suggests, OFDM is clearly better than CDMA. This performance is analyzed against extreme multipath delay spread conditions and with same number of users and total data transmitted. The channel effects are also same for both systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 1st IEEE and IFIP International Conference in Central Asia on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/10649/33616/01598200.pdf","startPage":"5 pp.","publicationTitle":"2005 1st IEEE and IFIP International Conference in Central Asia on Internet","doi":"10.1109/CANET.2005.1598200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CANET.2005.1598200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33616","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1598200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of OFDM with CDMA system in wireless telecommunication for multipath delay spread","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Delay","OFDM modulation","Intersymbol interference","Bandwidth","Finite impulse response filter","Fading","Performance analysis","Bit error rate","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","3G mobile communication","delays","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","CDMA system","wireless telecommunication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","parallel transmission","high-rate serial data stream","low-rate sub streams","data rate reduction","multipath fading","third generation mobile phone systems","code division multiple access","modulation technique","bit error rate","BER performance","extreme multipath delay spread conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of OFDM with CDMA system in wireless telecommunication for multipath delay spread","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598200/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8903727","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of OFDM with CDMA system in wireless telecommunication for multipath delay spread","confLoc":"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","sourcePdf":"01598200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041729S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10649","isNumber":"33616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10649","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33616","articleId":"1598200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1598214,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In speaker recognition, the major problem is how to generate a set of the GMM for identification purposes based upon the training data. Due to the hill-climbing characteristic of the expectation maximization (EM) method, it is sensitive to the initial model parameters and easy to lead to a sub-optimal model in practice. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a new hybrid training method based on the global searching capability of genetic algorithms (GA) and the effectiveness of fuzzy approach to obtain GMMs with optimized model parameters. Experimental results based on PKU-SRSC database showed that this method could obtain more optimized GMMs and better results than the hybrid GA based on the EM re-estimation and the traditional EM method.","doi":"10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598723","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10654/33621/01598723.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms and fuzzy approach to Gaussian mixture model for speaker recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Speaker recognition","Optimization methods","Databases","Speech recognition","Clustering algorithms","Training data","Clustering methods","Hidden Markov models","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","speaker recognition","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","search problems","fuzzy set theory","pattern clustering","expectation-maximisation algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian mixture models","speaker recognition","hill-climbing characteristics","expectation maximization method","genetic algorithms","PKU-SRSC database","fuzzy clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and fuzzy approach to Gaussian mixture model for speaker recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598723/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8873704","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and fuzzy approach to Gaussian mixture model for speaker recognition","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"01598723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071224S","chronDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10654","isNumber":"33621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10654","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33621","articleId":"1598723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1598738,"authors":[{"name":"Q.I.

Reducing power consumption requires optimization across all the layers of the communication systems. Although the MAC layer plays a crucial role in the overall energy efficiency, the radio remains one of the bottleneck for implementing ultra low-power WSN. The power consumption of the radios available today does not allow for continuous operation and the radio has to be duty-cycled in order to reach the targeted several years autonomy. This clearly has an impact on how to design a radio for WSN. Reducing the node size can be partly achieved by a high level of integration of all the functions required by one node on a single chip. This leads to systems-on-chip (SoC) that are dedicated to WSN. This paper addresses the different issues in the design of ultra low-power WSN with a particular emphasis on the radio. It reviews the constraints imposed on the transceiver design by the low-power and low-voltage specifications, the duty-cycled operation and the modulation scheme. Several radio architectures that can potentially be used for WSN are discussed in the perspective of a CMOS implementation. As examples, the 1st-and 2nd-generation of WiseNET ultra low-power transceivers are presented. The 1st-generation WiseNET transceiver is integrated in a 0.5 /spl mu/m standard digital CMOS process. It operates in the 434 MHz band and consumes only 1 mW from a 1 V supply, while achieving a -95 dBm sensitivity for a 24 kb/s data rate with a 10/sup -3/ BER. The 2nd-generation WiseNET transceiver was designed and specifically optimized for the new WiseMAC protocol specially developed for WSN. It runs from a single 1.5 V battery and operates down to 0.9 V while consuming only 1.8 mW in receive mode. It achieves a -104 dBm sensitivity for 25 kb/s data rate with a 10/sup -3/ BER. In addition to this low-power radio, the 2nd-generation WiseNET system-on-chip (SoC) also includes all the functions required for data acquisition, processing and storage of the information provided by the sensor. The WiseNET solution comprising the WiseNET SoC together with the WiseMAC protocol consumes more than 30 times less power than comparable solutions available today, using for example the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Finally, some important blocks such as the frequency synthesizer and the ADC are discussed in the perspective of moving to higher data rates, higher operating frequency and phase modulation, taking as example the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Examples of injection locked oscillators and dividers are given. The conversion of I/Q phase modulated signals to digital are illustrated by an example of an I/Q /spl Delta/-/spl Sigma/ ADC and a direct phase ADC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra low-power radio design for wireless sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Wkshp on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology: Integrated Circuits for Wideband Comm & Wireless Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/RFIT.2005.1598863","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Wkshp on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology: Integrated Circuits for Wideband Comm & Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/10655/33622/01598863.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIT.2005.1598863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1598863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1598863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Ultra low-power radio design for wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1598863/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857067","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra low-power radio design for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01598863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099424S","chronDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10655","isNumber":"33622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10655","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"33622","articleId":"1598863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1598879,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We prove several interesting results concerning the hardness of these problems for K ges 2. In particular, we show that MWKVMP does not even belong to APX; where APX denotes the class of problems to which a constant factor approximation can be obtained in polynomial time.

Among them, ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) is considered the best solution in terms of security, computational requirements and storage need for secret and public keys. Energy consumption is among the main constraints to be considered in wireless sensor networks. In the case of sensor networks, the typical approaches of minimizing latency via a complete hardware coprocessor or reducing area overhead via an efficient implementation of finite field operations might not provide the best solution.

In the previous approach, which was reported in the literature, an inverse discrete Fourier transform technique was proposed for obtaining the signal weighting coefficients. This approach was demonstrated for large arrays in which the physical parameters of the antenna elements were not considered. In this paper, a modified signal-weighting algorithm that works for arbitrary-size arrays is described. Its validity is demonstrated in examples of moderate-size arrays with real antenna elements. It is shown that in some cases, the original beam-forming algorithm fails, while the new algorithm is able to form the desired radiation pattern over a wide frequency band. The performance of the new algorithm is assessed for two cases when the mutual coupling between array elements is both neglected and taken into account.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2005","volume":"47","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"8812214","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599169/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Investigations into a wideband spatial beamformer employing a rectangular array of planar monopoles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigations into a wideband spatial beamformer employing a rectangular array of planar monopoles","sourcePdf":"1599169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08024S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"33625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33625","articleId":"1599169","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599171,"authors":[{"name":"Minhong Mi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/33625/1599171/1599171-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minhong Mi received his BS in Electronics from Peking University in 1996, and his MS in Opto-Electronics from Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 1999.

The possibility of an antenna-array element failure is examined in this paper. If an element fails during operation, a significant degradation in the array's performance is observed, even after the redistribution of the excitation coefficients of the remaining elements. In recent research in the field, the redistribution of the elements' excitation coefficients is performed after the array failure, and the possibility of failure is not taken into account during the design of the array. In this paper, the possibility of a one-element failure is predicted and properly treated in early design stages. If the array is initially designed taking into account the possibility of a one-element failure, the elements' coefficients are redistributed more efficiently and the failure mitigation is superior. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technique, two eight-element, switched-beam circular arrays, covering the horizontal plane, were designed using the method of genetic algorithms (GAs). The array elements were considered to be identical dipoles, placed vertically to the x-y plane. The beamwidth of the main-beam lobe was 45/spl deg/ (2/spl pi//N where N is the number of the array elements), the while maximum relative side lobe level (RSLL) was intended. Numerical results showed excellent agreement with the design goals.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2005.1599213","startPage":"227","endPage":"232","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/33625/01599213.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2005.1599213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On array failure mitigation using genetic algorithms and a priori joint optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Antenna arrays","Dipole antennas","Degradation","Antenna feeds","Voltage","Materials science and technology","Transmitting antennas","Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antenna arrays","genetic algorithms","failure analysis","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array failure mitigation","genetic algorithms","priori joint optimization","antenna arrays","switched-beam circular arrays","identical dipoles","relative side lobe level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","displayDocTitle":"On array failure mitigation using genetic algorithms and a priori joint optimization","volume":"47","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1599213/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8812223","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On array failure mitigation using genetic algorithms and a priori joint optimization","sourcePdf":"1599213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059263S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"33625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33625","articleId":"1599213","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1599236,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most popular technologies in the soft computing area for solving distribution system problems. However, due to the radial structure of power distribution system, traditional GAs may encounter some difficulties when searching for the optimal solution. Evolutionary programming (EP) was also being used to solve some distribution system problems, for example, loss minimization, service restoration, capacitor placement and many others. Hence, the EP is applied in this paper in order to overcome the weakness of traditional GAs (Fudou et. al, (1997); Miranda et al., (1994); Nara et al., (2003); Ying-Tung Hsiao, (2004), Back et al., (2004); Ying-Tung Hsiao and Ching-Yang Chien, 2000).

It is critical for the system to be reconfigurable for the purpose of survivability and reliability. In our earlier work an agent based de-centralized approach for a radial SPS reconfiguration is successfully developed. Each agent in this system only communicates with its immediate neighbors, which reduces the dependency on the system topology. However, when expanding the technique to a meshed structure in the SPS, this lead to the problem of redundant information accumulation among the agents, making the information flow in the system unstable. In this paper, the authors propose a spanning tree algorithm for an agent system, which breaks the mesh-structured system into a single tree-structured system. Then an algorithm for calculating the information flow among agents without redundant information accumulation is presented.

Motivated by the multi-resolution definition in multi-resolution approximation theory, this paper proposes a novel WNN-based modeling approach possessing two unique characteristics. Firstly, a multi-resolution system model, having an output corresponding to each resolution, is developed from a coarser approximation to a finer representation by adding more details progressively. Secondly, the model at a low resolution is compatible with the model at a high resolution, which means that the well trained WNNs used in a low resolution can be directly incorporated into a high resolution without any modification. The theoretical verification of this approach shows that the incremental characteristic and the compatibility feature of the system modeling at different resolutions is guaranteed by the definition of the modeling subspace division and by the utilization of the dyadic activation functions in WNNs. As a result, by applying this technology into electric ship design and simulation, different users can activate different resolutions according to their requirements during model utilization. At the same time, the compatible modeling structure avoids a large amount of modeling repetition for model developers and thus lightens the computational burden","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2005.1599262","startPage":"7 pp.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on, Intelligent Systems Application to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2005.1599262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33627","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on, Intelligent Systems Application to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10658/33627/01599262.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An incremental modeling approach with a hierarchical structure and progressive accuracy using dyadic wavelet-based neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599262/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An incremental modeling approach with a hierarchical structure and progressive accuracy using dyadic wavelet-based neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599262/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8914181","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An incremental modeling approach with a hierarchical structure and progressive accuracy using dyadic wavelet-based neural networks","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056925S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10658","isNumber":"33627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10658","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33627","articleId":"1599262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599263,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is a challenge to get the steady-state model for a high order complex nonlinear power plant. Moreover, the model should be adaptive under the changing environment. In this paper, a multi-agent system-based intelligent steady-state model (MAS-ISSM) is presented as an alternative methodology to identify the steady-state model in a large-scale 600 MW thermal power plant. Design of architectures for single agents and an organization of the multi-agent system will be described as the foundation of the intelligent steady-state model (ISSM). The MAS-ISSM will be utilized in the evaluation process and the set-point scheduler to map various control inputs to power and pressure set-points for multiobjective optimization in the power plant. The procedure is presented through a case study, and its feasibility is demonstrated with the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2005.1599300","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on, Intelligent Systems Application to Power Systems","startPage":"6 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2005.1599300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33627","pdfPath":"/iel5/10658/33627/01599300.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on, Intelligent Systems Application to Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent systems","Steady-state","Power system modeling","Power generation","Large-scale systems","Automation","Robustness","Multiagent systems","Intelligent agent","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal power stations","power plants","multi-agent systems","power system control","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiagent system","intelligent steady-state model","large-scale power system","nonlinear power plant","thermal power plant","set-point scheduler","multiobjective optimization","distributed system","power plant control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A multi-agent system-based intelligent steady-state model for a power plant","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599300/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599300/","accessionNumber":"8914219","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-agent system-based intelligent steady-state model for a power plant","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049597S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10658","isNumber":"33627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10658","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33627","articleId":"1599300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAP","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1599302,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When signals deviate from these conditions, the transform outcomes are suspect. A chirp, which by definition has a frequency that varies with time, doesn't satisfy these requirements, and its fast Fourier transform (FFT) doesn't adequately express the changing nature of the signal's frequency content. In this analysis of a bat chirp, I first examine how the FFT handles a chirp and then how we can use a sequence of windows that individually span only a portion of the total time-domain signal to generate a frequency versus time description of the signal. The trade-off in this kind of windowing is between dynamic response and resolution: we obtain improved dynamics if we use shorter windows, whereas we get better resolution with longer windows. This article and this series concludes with a brief look at the Hilbert-Huang transform, which isn't constrained by the same assumptions as the FFT. This transform process consists of two independent sets of operations. The first, called empirical mode decomposition, generates a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), from the data. The second step extracts phase information from each IMF and its Hilbert transform. The derivative of the phase with respect to time yields the instantaneous frequency. The net effect of these operations is to transform the time-domain data to frequency versus time data instead of the amplitude versus frequency the FFT obtains","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fast Fourier transform for experimentalists.

This algorithm is referred to as the TM (transaction mapping) algorithm from hereon. In this algorithm, transaction ids of each itemset are mapped and compressed to continuous transaction intervals in a different space and the counting of itemsets is performed by intersecting these interval lists in a depth-first order along the lexicographic tree. When the compression coefficient becomes smaller than the average number of comparisons for intervals intersection at a certain level, the algorithm switches to transaction id intersection. We have evaluated the algorithm against two popular frequent itemset mining algorithms, FP-growth and dEclat, using a variety of data sets with short and long frequent patterns. Experimental data show that the TM algorithm outperforms these two algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2006.1599386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/33630/01599386.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2006.1599386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transaction mapping algorithm for frequent itemsets mining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599386/","displayDocTitle":"A transaction mapping algorithm for frequent itemsets mining","volume":"18","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8944917","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599386/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transaction mapping algorithm for frequent itemsets mining","sourcePdf":"01599386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058857S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"33630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"33630","articleId":"1599386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599387,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the area of data mining, there have been increased interest in these issues since outlier detection is related to fraud detection, rare event discovery, etc., while change-point detection is related to event/trend change detection, activity monitoring, etc. Although, in most previous work, outlier detection and change point detection have not been related explicitly, this paper presents a unifying framework for dealing with both of them. In this framework, a probabilistic model of time series is incrementally learned using an online discounting learning algorithm, which can track a drifting data source adaptively by forgetting out-of-date statistics gradually. A score for any given data is calculated in terms of its deviation from the learned model, with a higher score indicating a high possibility of being an outlier. By taking an average of the scores over a window of a fixed length and sliding the window, we may obtain a new time series consisting of moving-averaged scores. Change point detection is then reduced to the issue of detecting outliers in that time series. We compare the performance of our framework with those of conventional methods to demonstrate its validity through simulation and experimental applications to incidents detection in network security.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/33630/01599387.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2006.1599387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2006.1599387","startPage":"482","endPage":"492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unifying framework for detecting outliers and change points from time series","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599387/","displayDocTitle":"A unifying framework for detecting outliers and change points from time series","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599387/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"8944918","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","publicationDate":"April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unifying framework for detecting outliers and change points from time series","sourcePdf":"01599387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105586S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"33630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"33630","articleId":"1599387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1599390,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This paper proposes an end-to-end architecture for multilayer progressive video delivery over space-time differentially coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (STDC-OFDM) systems. An input video sequence is compressed by 3D-ESCOT into a layered bitstream. We input multiple layers of the bitstream in series to a STDC-OFDM channel. Different video source layers are protected by different error protection schemes in order to achieve unequal error protection. In progressive transmission, the reconstruction quality is important not only at the target transmission rate but also at the intermediate rates. So, the error protection strategy needs to optimize the average performance over the set of intermediate rates. We propose to use progressive joint source-channel coding to generate operational transmission distortion-rate (TD-R) functions and operational transmission distortion-power (TD-P) functions for multiple layers before forming the operational transmission distortion-power-rate (TD-PR) surfaces. Lagrange multipliers are then employed on the fly to obtain the optimal power allocation and optimal rate allocation among multiple layers, subject to constraints on the total transmission rate and the total power level. Progressive joint source-channel coding offers the scalability feature to handle bandwidth variations and changes in channel conditions. By extending the rate-distortion function in source coding to the TD-PR surface in joint source-channel coding, our work can use the \"equal slope\" argument to effectively solve the transmission rate allocation problem as well as the transmission power allocation problem for multilayer video transmission. Experiments show that our scheme achieves significant improvement over a nonoptimal system with the same total power level and total transmission rate.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.1599401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/33631/01599401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.1599401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33631","startPage":"303","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive video delivery over wideband wireless channels using space-time differentially coded OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Progressive video delivery over wideband wireless channels using space-time differentially coded OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599401/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2006","accessionNumber":"8938269","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599401/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive video delivery over wideband wireless channels using space-time differentially coded OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01599401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102461S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"33631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"33631","articleId":"1599401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1599404,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/33631/1599404/1599404-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Xue received the BS degree in Computer Science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 1998 and the MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2002 and 2005.

None of the existing resource allocation algorithms in wireless ad hoc networks have realistically considered end-to-end flows spanning multiple hops. Moreover, strategies proposed in wireline networks are not applicable in the context of wireless ad hoc networks, due to their unique characteristics of location-dependent contention. In this paper, we propose a new price-based resource allocation framework in wireless ad hoc networks to achieve optimal resource utilization and fairness among competing end-to-end flows. We build our pricing framework on the notion of maximal cliques in wireless ad hoc networks, as compared to individual links in traditional wide-area wireline networks. Based on such a price-based theoretical framework, we present a two-tier iterative algorithm. Distributed across wireless nodes, the algorithm converges to a global network optimum with respect to resource allocations. We further improve the algorithm toward asynchronous network settings and prove its convergence. Extensive simulations under a variety of network environments have been conducted to validate our theoretical claims.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2006","volume":"5","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"8938272","publicationDate":"April 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599404/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal resource allocation in wireless ad hoc networks: a price-based approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal resource allocation in wireless ad hoc networks: a price-based approach","sourcePdf":"01599404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101938S","chronDate":"April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"33631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"33631","articleId":"1599404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1599406,"authors":[{"name":"Weifa Liang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/33631/1599406/1599406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weifa Liang received the BSc degree from Wuhan University, China, in 1984, the ME degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1989, and the PhD degree from the Australian National University in 1998, all in computer science.

As mobile nodes are battery-operated, an important issue in such a network is to minimize the total power consumption for each operation. Multicast is one of fundamental operations in any modern telecommunication network including wireless ad hoc networks. Given a multicast request consisting of a source node and a set of destination nodes, the problem is to build a minimum-energy multicast tree for the request such that the total transmission power consumption in the tree is minimized.

We applied the proposed methods to the SEL defect data consisting of more than 200 projects over more than 15 years. The results show that, for defect association prediction, the accuracy is very high and the false-negative rate is very low. Likewise, for the defect correction effort prediction, the accuracy for both defect isolation effort prediction and defect correction effort prediction are also high. We compared the defect correction effort prediction method with other types of methods - PART, C4.5, and Naive Bayes - and show that accuracy has been improved by at least 23 percent. We also evaluated the impact of support and confidence levels on prediction accuracy, false-negative rate, false-positive rate, and the number of rules. We found that higher support and confidence levels may not result in higher prediction accuracy, and a sufficient number of rules is a precondition for high prediction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2006.1599417","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/33632/01599417.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"82","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2006.1599417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software defect association mining and defect correction effort prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Software defect association mining and defect correction effort prediction","volume":"32","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8943160","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599417/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software defect association mining and defect correction effort prediction","sourcePdf":"01599417.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088296S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"33632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"33632","articleId":"1599417","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1599430,"authors":[{"name":"V.J.

This method is designed to utilize the favorable denoising properties of two frequently used techniques: the sparsity and multiresolution properties of the wavelet, and the iterative edge enhancement feature of nonlinear diffusion. With fully exploited knowledge of speckle image models, the edges of images are detected using normalized wavelet modulus. Relying on this feature, both the envelope-detected speckle image and the log-compressed ultrasonic image can be directly processed by the algorithm without need for additional preprocessing. Speckle is suppressed by employing the iterative multiscale diffusion on the wavelet coefficients. With a tuning diffusion threshold strategy, the proposed method can improve the image quality for both visualization and auto-segmentation applications. We validate our method using synthetic speckle images and real ultrasonic images. Performance improvement over other despeckling filters is quantified in terms of noise suppression and edge preservation indices.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2005.862737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/33634/01599444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2005.862737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33634","startPage":"297","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear multiscale wavelet diffusion for speckle suppression and edge enhancement in ultrasound images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear multiscale wavelet diffusion for speckle suppression and edge enhancement in ultrasound images","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599444/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8806022","pubMedId":"16524086","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599444/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear multiscale wavelet diffusion for speckle suppression and edge enhancement in ultrasound images","sourcePdf":"01599444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099309S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"33634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"33634","articleId":"1599444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599462,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Lung Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanical and Electro-Mechanical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Chin-Lung Cheng","id":"37420438200"},{"name":"Kuei-Shu Chang-Liao","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"lastName":"Kuei-Shu Chang-Liao","id":"38272104100"},{"name":"Tzu-Chen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"lastName":"Tzu-Chen Wang","id":"38271325500"},{"name":"Tien-Ko Wang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"lastName":"Tien-Ko Wang","id":"38359928800"},{"name":"Howard Chih-Hao Wang","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Howard Chih-Hao Wang","id":"37292551900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"1599462","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal stability","Electrodes","MOS devices","Hafnium","Voltage","Silicon","Transistors","Spectroscopy","Rapid thermal annealing","Character generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIS devices","MOS capacitors","work function","rapid thermal annealing","thermal stability","hafnium compounds","tantalum compounds","silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal stability","metal gate electrodes","MOS devices","work function","electrical properties","equivalent oxide thickness","interface trap density","defect generation rate","annealing","45 s","HfTaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["metal gate","thermal stability","work function"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the composition effects of hafnium (Hf) and tantalum (Ta) in Hf/sub x/Ta/sub y/N metal gate on the thermal stability of MOS devices were investigated.

In the current investigation, a detailed numerical simulation of the heat transfer occurring in silicon-based microchannel heat sinks has been conducted in order to optimize the geometric structure using a simplified, three-dimensional (3-D) conjugate heat transfer model [two-dimensional (2-D) fluid flow and 3-D heat transfer]. The micro heat sink modeled in this investigation consists of a 10 mm long silicon substrate with rectangular microchannels fabricated with different geometries. The rectangular microchannels had widths ranging from 20 /spl mu/m to 220 /spl mu/m and a depth ranging from 100 /spl mu/m to 400 /spl mu/m. The effect of the microchannel geometry on the temperature distribution in the microchannel heat sink is presented and discussed assuming a constant pumping power. The model was validated by comparing the predicted results with previously published experimental results and theoretical analyses, and indicated that both the physical geometry of the microchannel and the thermophysical properties of the substrate are important parameters in the design and optimization of these microchannel heat sinks. For the silicon-water micro heat sink, the optimal configuration for rectangular channel heat sinks occurred when the number of channels approached 120 channels per centimeter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8808100","volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1599504/","publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Geometric optimization of a micro heat sink with liquid flow","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric optimization of a micro heat sink with liquid flow","sourcePdf":"01599504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091712S","chronDate":"March  2006","xplore-pub-id":"6144","isNumber":"33636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6144","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"33636","articleId":"1599504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1599514,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

Here, health is defined as the extent of degradation or deviation from an expected normal condition. While the application of health monitoring, also referred to as prognostics, is well established for assessment of mechanical systems, this is not the case for electronic systems. However, electronic systems are integral to the functionality of most systems today, and their reliability is often critical for system reliability. This paper presents the state-of-practice and the current state-of-research in the area of electronics prognostics and health management. Four current approaches include built-in-test (BIT), use of fuses and canary devices, monitoring and reasoning of failure precursors, and modeling accumulated damage based on measured life-cycle loads.

Commercially available third-generation (3G) products adopt a hybrid direct conversion architecture, where an inter-stage surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter between low noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer attenuates out-of-band interferers, alleviating linearity requirements set on the downconversion mixer. As a drawback, an off-chip component and an additional LNA are introduced, raising costs. Leveraging an in-depth analysis of second-order inter-modulation mechanisms in active downconversion mixers, this paper presents the design of a 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS solution with outstanding linearity and noise performances. The input transconductor is RC degenerated, the output resistors are carefully matched and, most important, the parasitic capacitors at switching pair common sources are tuned out. Sixty samples from two distinct fabrication lots have been characterized. Minimum IIP2 is +78 dBm. For comparison, a second solution where inter-modulation products generated by the switching pair are not filtered out has been fabricated and tested. IIP2 values are always lower. Other measured performance results are: 16-dB gain with 4.5-MHz output bandwidth; +10-dBm out-of-band IIP3; 4-nV//spl radic/Hz input referred noise voltage density while drawing 4 mA from 1.8 V.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.864123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/33637/01599524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.864123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33637","startPage":"552","endPage":"559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A +78 dBm IIP2 CMOS direct downconversion mixer for fully integrated UMTS receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A +78 dBm IIP2 CMOS direct downconversion mixer for fully integrated UMTS receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599524/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8808607","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599524/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A +78 dBm IIP2 CMOS direct downconversion mixer for fully integrated UMTS receivers","sourcePdf":"01599524.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099925S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"33637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"33637","articleId":"1599524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1599526,"authors":[{"name":"Jri Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/33637/1599526/1599526-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jri Lee (M'03) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1995 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), both in 2003.","He was with Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, from 1997 to 1998.

The deterministic nature of data-dependent jitter suggests equalization techniques suitable for high-speed circuits. Two equalizer circuit implementations are presented. The first is a SiGe clock and data recovery circuit modified to incorporate a deterministic jitter equalizer. This circuit demonstrates the reduction of jitter in the recovered clock.

The analysis highlights unique aspects of crosstalk-induced jitter that differ from far-end crosstalk. The model is used to predict the crosstalk-induced jitter in 2-PAM and 4-PAM, which is compared to measurement. Furthermore, the model suggests an equalizer that compensates for the data-induced electromagnetic coupling between adjacent links and is suitable for pre- or post-emphasis schemes. The circuits are implemented using 130-nm MOSFETs and operate at 5-10 Gb/s. The results demonstrate reduced deterministic jitter and lower bit-error rate (BER).

General SoCs have large on-chip SRAMs, which consume a large proportion of the whole LSI power. To achieve a low-power SoC, we have developed embedded SRAM modules, which use some low-power SRAM techniques. One technique involves expanding the write margin; another is a power-line-floating write technique, which enables low-voltage write operation. The power-line-floating write technique makes it possible to lower the minimum operating supply voltage by 100 mV. The other techniques involve using a process-variation-adaptive write replica circuit and reducing leakage current. These techniques reduce active power during write operations by 18% and reduce active leakage of the word-line driver by 64%.

We argue that linear representations provide little support for the conceptualization, contextualization, and visualization of the discussion. To address these drawbacks, we propose the usage of semantic networks for representing discussions. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of semantic network representation to discussions through the development of a prototype named CollectiveThought. We also test some of the potential benefits of semantic network discussion representation with an empirical study. More specifically, we compare these two modes of discussion representation (i.e., linear versus semantic network) in terms of effects on the communication process as measured by perceived contextualization and on the communication outcome as measured by mutual understanding, using both subjective and objective indicators. The results show that semantic network discussion representation leads to a higher level of perceived contextualization and better mutual understanding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","volume":"49","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"8808857","publicationDate":"March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599555/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Semantic network discussion representation: applicability and some potential benefits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic network discussion representation: applicability and some potential benefits","sourcePdf":"01599555.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145615S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"47","isNumber":"33638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"47","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33638","articleId":"1599555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1599571,"authors":[{"name":"Bowei Song","affiliation":["Institute of Image Communication and Information Processing, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Bowei Song","id":"37554835200"},{"name":"Lin Gui","affiliation":["Institute of Image Communication and Information Processing, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lin Gui","id":"37409860500"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Image Communication and Information Processing, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wenjun Zhang","id":"37278428800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"1599571","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":753},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Space time codes","Frequency domain analysis","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Bandwidth","Performance analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","OFDM modulation","modulation coding","space-time codes","transmitting antennas","channel estimation","time-frequency analysis","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity transmission","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","space time code","transmitting antenna","channel estimation","receiver","frequency domain","time domain","comb type pilot based algorithm","bandwidth efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","comb type pilot","frequency domain","OFDM","pilot design","space time code","time domain","transmit diversity"]}],"abstract":"Transmit diversity can be applied to OFDM systems by adopting space time code. Since the received signal is the overlapped signals transmitted from different transmit antennas, channel estimation is a rather challenging task for space time coded OFDM (ST-OFDM) systems. Pilot structure can help the receiver to effectively separate the overlapped signals and perform accurate channel estimation. In this paper, we propose three different channel estimation algorithms based on specially designed comb type pilots inserted in frequency domain. One of our proposed algorithms is performed in frequency domain and the other two are performed in time domain. Such comb type pilot based algorithms can provide higher bandwidth efficiency than common significant-tap-catching algorithm using training block pilots. Numerical analyzes and computational simulation show that our proposed estimation schemes have the same good performance while the time domain methods have relatively simple structure.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2005.860533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/33639/01599571.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2005.860533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comb type pilot aided channel estimation in OFDM systems with transmit diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599571/","displayDocTitle":"Comb type pilot aided channel estimation in OFDM systems with transmit diversity","volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8935034","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599571/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comb type pilot aided channel estimation in OFDM systems with transmit diversity","sourcePdf":"01599571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089415S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"33639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"33639","articleId":"1599571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1599572,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlin Yan","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Chunlin Yan","id":"37400493900"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Shaoqian Li","id":"37279617000"},{"name":"Youxi Tang","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Youxi Tang","id":"37277296700"},{"name":"Xiao Luo","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Luo","id":"37417418300"},{"name":"Jiayi Fang","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jiayi Fang","id":"37955639100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"1599572","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Delay estimation","AWGN channels","Fading","Bandwidth","Fast Fourier transforms","Frequency division multiplexing","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","correlation theory","AWGN channels","multipath channels","fading channels","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization method","frequency offset estimation method","correlation","training sequence","flexibility","AWGN channel","multipath fading channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","training sequence"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a novel frequency synchronization method which has larger estimation range than conventional method proposed by Tufvesson. A two steps frequency offset estimation method is performed in the new method. In the first step the received signal is correlated with local training sequence to eliminate the influence of training sequence which makes the estimation range of frequency offset is independent of period of the repeated data in the training sequence. The received signal is correlated with its delay in the second step to obtain the fine estimation of frequency offset. Precise estimation can be achieved in the proposed method than Tufvesson's method. The period of the repeated data in the training sequence determines the estimation range of the frequency offset in the conventional method, while in the new method they are irrelevant. Tens of subcarriers spacing can be estimated by the new method. The new method can be used in other cases as long as a known sequence is transmitted, which will introduce valuable flexibility in training sequence design.

For the multicarrier transmission, the differential orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with diversity reception are discussed. It is well known that there are two types of differential OFDM systems, namely, the time domain differential OFDM (TD-OFDM) and the frequency domain differential OFDM (FD-OFDM). In this paper, the NSD and its special cases are incorporated to the differential OFDM systems. Furthermore, we provide a simple closed-form bit-error-rate (BER) expression for the differential OFDM systems utilizing the noncoherent one-shot detector with diversity reception in the time-varying multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical results have revealed that, with multi-antenna diversity reception, the performance of the noncoherent one-shot detector is improved significantly. However, when only one or two receive antennas are available, the implementation of the linearly predictive DF detector or the linearly predictive Viterbi receiver is necessary for achieving better and satisfactory performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/33639/01599573.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE

However, memory effects of HPAs can no longer be ignored when communication systems have wider bandwidth. Memoryless predistortion techniques proposed previously seldom have satisfactory effectiveness for typical wideband applications such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) systems. In this paper, an improved adaptive predistortion method called 2D LUT (2-dimension look-up table) with different accuracy levels is presented to linearize HPAs with memory effects. Simulation and experimental results show that 2D LUT implements excellent performance in mitigating the signal deterioration caused by memory effects, both rectifies the signal constellation distortion and suppresses the spectrum emission. Large scale matrix computation is also avoidable in these adaptive algorithms, which makes them feasible when a real-time system is necessary.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2005.861608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/33639/01599577.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2005.861608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved look-up table predistortion technique for HPA with memory effects in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599577/","displayDocTitle":"An improved look-up table predistortion technique for HPA with memory effects in OFDM systems","volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8942955","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599577/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved look-up table predistortion technique for HPA with memory effects in OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01599577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044981S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"33639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"33639","articleId":"1599577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599578,"authors":[{"name":"N.H.

This technique is therefore very attractive for many broadcasting services where transmission bandwidth is a primary concern. It has been shown that when signal constellation, interleaver and error-control code are fixed, signal mapping has a critical influence to the error performance of a BICM-ID system. Based on the technique of mutual information, good mappings of different 8-ary constellations are presented for BICM-ID systems over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. It is also shown that, compared to free Euclidean distances, mutual information is a more useful technique to find the good signal mappings for BICM-ID systems.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2005.860536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/33639/01599578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2005.860536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33639","startPage":"92","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal mappings of 8-ary constellations for bit interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal mappings of 8-ary constellations for bit interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599578/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"8935038","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599578/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal mappings of 8-ary constellations for bit interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding","sourcePdf":"01599578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088558S","chronDate":"March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"33639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"33639","articleId":"1599578","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599589,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this letter, we jointly study optimal bandwidth allocation between the data channel, modeled as a flat-fading multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel, and the feedback channel for maximum average throughput in the data channel using a beamforming scheme. We consider two models of the partial CSI at the transmitter (CSIT): the noisy CSIT, modeled as jointly Gaussian with the actual channel state, and the quantized CSIT. In the first model, we use distortion-rate theory to relate the CSIT accuracy to the feedback-link bandwidth. In the second model, we derive a lower bound on the achievable rate of the data channel based on the ensemble of a set of random quantization codebooks. We show that in the MISO flat-fading channel case, beamforming based on feedback CSI can achieve an average rate larger than the capacity without CSIT under a wide range of mobility conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33640","startPage":"197","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33640/01599590.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal bandwidth allocation for the data and feedback channels in MISO-FDD systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599590/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal bandwidth allocation for the data and feedback channels in MISO-FDD systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8808828","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal bandwidth allocation for the data and feedback channels in MISO-FDD systems","sourcePdf":"01599590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057653S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33640","articleId":"1599590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1599591,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We take an approach wherein the objective function is reduced to a form appropriate for the application of a polynomial complexity algorithm in computational geometry, while keeping the decision region combinatorial.

Throughout this letter, the term \"timing error\" would refer to this type of error. Such errors degrade the performance of an OFDM receiver by introducing intercarrier interference (ICI) and intersymbol interference (ISI). They can occur due to either an erroneous initial frame synchronization or a change in the power delay profile of the channel. In this letter, we provide a mathematical analysis of the effect of timing errors on the performance of an OFDM receiver in a frequency-selective fading environment. The analysis presented in this letter is for the case that no equalization technique has been used to mitigate the introduced ICI and ISI. We find exact formulas for the power of interference terms and the resulting average signal-to-interference ratio. We further extend the analysis to the subsample level. Our results show the nonsymmetric effect of timing errors on the performance of an OFDM system. Finally, simulation results confirm the analysis.

OFDM is robust against frequency-selective fading, but it is more vulnerable to time-selective fading than single-carrier systems. In ST-OFDM, channel time variations cause not only intercarrier interference among different subcarriers in one OFDM symbol, but also intertransmit-antenna interference. We quantify the impact of time-selective fading on the performance of quasi-orthogonal ST-OFDM systems by deriving, via an analytical approach, the expressions of carrier-to-interference and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios. We observe that system error performance is insensitive to changes in vehicle speeds and the channel power-delay profile, but very sensitive to changes in the number of subcarriers. We also evaluate the performance of five different detection schemes in the presence of time-selective fading. We show that although there exist differences in their relative performances, all these detection schemes suffer from an irreducible error floor.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33640/01599598.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of time-selective fading on the performance of quasi-orthogonal space-time-coded OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599598/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of time-selective fading on the performance of quasi-orthogonal space-time-coded OFDM systems","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8808836","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599598/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of time-selective fading on the performance of quasi-orthogonal space-time-coded OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01599598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068849S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"33640","articleId":"1599598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599599,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The modulation scheme generates improper complex multiple-access interference (MAI) and necessitates the use of WL receivers. Focus is on bandlimited pulse shapes and the inherent cyclostationarity (CS) of the uncoded received signal. The enhanced WL receiver replaces the conventional chip-matched filter with new filters that exploit the CS of the received signal through frequency shifting. The proposed WL receiver is shown to outperform the classical strictly linear (SL) receiver when the interfering users are (quasi-)synchronous with respect to the user of interest. High-powered interfering users, that may exist to support high data rates, increase the performance improvement delivered by the WL receiver. Moreover, it is shown that MAI can become proper, either identically or asymptotically, when users are asynchronous and equally powered. This is despite the fact that individual interfering signals are improper. Numerical results demonstrate that the WL receiver can outperform the SL receiver by 1-3 dB under the examined scenarios with current CDMA standards settings. In asynchronous or quasi-synchronous transmission modes, performance gain of the WL receiver degrades unless the number of high-powered active users remains small. An example for implementation of the WL receiver is proposed and compared with that of the SL receiver when minimum-shift keying modulation, a special case of OQPSK, is used. The implementation is based on a fractionally spaced equalizer whose taps are updated by an adaptive algorithm. It is shown that the proposed structure is capable of delivering the maximum signal-to-noise ratio predicted by theory.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33640/01599599.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced widely linear CDMA receiver with OQPSK modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599599/","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced widely linear CDMA receiver with OQPSK modulation","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8808837","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599599/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced widely linear CDMA receiver with OQPSK modulation","sourcePdf":"01599599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082225S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"33640","articleId":"1599599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1599602,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The precise error-rate analysis is extended to a system using multichannel reception with maximal ratio combining. An asymptotic error-rate analysis is also provided. For a two-tap channel with finite values of Nakagami-m fading parameters, our analysis and numerical results show that the asymptotic error-rate performance of an OFDM signal is similar to that of a single carrier signal transmitted over a Rayleigh fading channel. On the other hand, our analysis further shows that a frequency-selective channel that can be represented by two constant taps has similar asymptotic error-rate performance to that of a one-sided Gaussian fading channel. It is observed that, depending on the number of channel taps, the error-rate performance does not necessarily improve with increasing Nakagami-m fading parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33640/01599605.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33640","startPage":"319","endPage":"328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate error-rate performance analysis of OFDM on frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate error-rate performance analysis of OFDM on frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8808843","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599605/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate error-rate performance analysis of OFDM on frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading channels","sourcePdf":"01599605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073128S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"33640","articleId":"1599605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599606,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Two timing algorithms are proposed that exploit the samples of the received signal to estimate the start of the individual frames with respect to the receiver's clock (frame timing) and the location of the first frame in each symbol (symbol timing). Channel estimation comes out as a by-product and can be used for coherent matched filter detection. The proposed algorithms require sampling rates on the order of the inverse of the pulse duration. Their performance is assessed by simulating the operation of coherent and differential detectors. Their sensitivity to the sampling rate is discussed, and the effects of the multiple access interference are evaluated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33640/01599606.pdf","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization algorithms for UWB signals","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863728","startPage":"329","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization algorithms for UWB signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599606/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","accessionNumber":"8808844","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599606/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization algorithms for UWB signals","sourcePdf":"01599606.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069539S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"33640","articleId":"1599606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1599607,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The received samples are observed over a window of length equal to the SW; over this window, a metric (e.g., correlation) is computed; an SW is declared if the computed metric is greater than a proper threshold, otherwise the observation window is time-shifted one sample. We assume a Gaussian channel, antipodal signaling, equally distributed data symbols, and coherent detection, where soft values are provided to the frame synchronizer. We state the problem starting from the hypothesis testing theory, deriving the optimum metric [optimum likelihood ratio test (LRT)] according to the Neyman-Pearson lemma. When the data distribution is unknown, we design a simple and effective test based on the generalized LRT (GLRT). We also analyze the performance of the commonly used correlation metric, both with \"hard\" and \"soft\" values at the synchronizer input. We show that synchronization can be greatly improved by using the LRT and GLRT metrics instead of correlation and that, among correlation-based tests, sometimes hard correlation is better than soft correlation. The obtained closed-form expressions allow the derivation of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the LRT and GLRT synchronizers, showing a remarkable gain with respect to synchronization based on correlation metric.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863727","endPage":"348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33640/01599607.pdf","startPage":"339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On sequential frame synchronization in AWGN channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599607/","displayDocTitle":"On sequential frame synchronization in AWGN channels","volume":"54","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"8808845","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599607/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On sequential frame synchronization in AWGN channels","sourcePdf":"01599607.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108508S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"33640","articleId":"1599607","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599608,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/33640/1599608/1599608-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Kai Wen received the B.S. degree from National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1998, the M.S. degree from National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2004.","His research interests are in the areas of wireless multiple-access communications, detection of spread-spectrum signal, statistic signal processing, and orthogonal frequency-division muliptlexing system."]},"lastName":"Chao-Kai Wen","id":"37280263500"},{"name":"Pangan Ting","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/33640/1599608/1599608-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Pangan Ting received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1991 and the M.S. degree from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1994, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Institute of Electrical Engineering.","His research interests are in the areas of wireless communications, statistic signal processing, and VLSI signal processing."]},"lastName":"Pangan Ting","id":"38523301900"},{"name":"Jiunn-Tsair Chen","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory, Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/33640/1599608/1599608-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Jiunn-Tsair Chen (M'99) received the B.S. degree from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1986, the M.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1998, all in electrical engineering.","Since August 1999, he has been with National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Important physical meanings revealed though the analytical solutions to those more practical combinations, such as how the input-output mutual information is affected by the channel spatial correlations, are highlighted along our derivation. Moreover, we provide a novel waterfilling algorithm to determine the data-rate-maximizing transmit signal covariance matrix when only the channel long-term spatial correlations are available at the transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33640/01599608.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.863726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33640","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of MIMO wireless systems with spatial correlation at the receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mutual information","Multiaccess communication","Receiving antennas","Information analysis","Decoding","Transmitters","Antenna theory","Mobile communication","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio networks","MIMO systems","radio receivers","wireless channels","antenna arrays","space-time codes","equalisers","covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic analysis","MIMO channels","wireless systems","spatial correlation","receiver","point-to-point systems","antenna array","multiple-input multiple-output channels","space-time joint decoding","spatial equalizers","temporal decoders","water-filling algorithm","covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna correlation","asymptotic analysis","channel capacity","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","replica method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2006","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of MIMO wireless systems with spatial correlation at the receiver","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1599608/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8808846","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic analysis of MIMO wireless systems with spatial correlation at the receiver","sourcePdf":"01599608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129963S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33640","articleId":"1599608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599692,"authors":[{"name":"D.

As a result, the spread data chips are assigned to different frequency bands at different times. Significant performance improvement can be achieved compared to the conventional MC-CDMA system.

We also compare the capacity with the mutual information obtained by the signaling solution optimal for the Jensen bound.

Offset and timing control commands are transmitted on the downlink with the eigencode and water-filling powers. A generalized successive interference cancellation (GSIC) algorithm for collector-based channel/offset/delay estimation is presented with quadratic complexity in the number of sensors. Analytical and simulation results demonstrating the efficacy of GSIC and performance degradation due to carrier offset/channel/timing estimation errors are given","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599734","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599734.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","startPage":"210","endPage":"214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation and Carrier Offset Control for Cooperative MIMO Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation and Carrier Offset Control for Cooperative MIMO Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599734/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969384","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation and Carrier Offset Control for Cooperative MIMO Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037113S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1599734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599736,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We address two main issues: (1) distributed fusion: how to achieve a global decision without transmitting the information (measurements or local decisions) from all the sensors to a common central location like in parallel architectures; and (2) connectivity graph: what should be the connectivity pattern among the sensors, in other words, with which sensors should each sensor communicate. This is a nontrivial question since it corresponds to designing the structure of a graph to achieve a given goal. For the first issue, we propose an iterative algorithm that fuses the data globally without the need for collecting them at one central location. For the second issue, we present a design methodology based on \"small world\" network engines that leads to connectivity patterns that provide fast convergence to the distributed detection algorithm. Results show that introducing 10% to 30% randomness in the connectivity graph leads to significant improvements over both regular patterns and totally random networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599738.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Detection in Sensor Networks: Connectivity Graph and Small World Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Sensor fusion","Convergence","Detection algorithms","Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis","Engines","Distributed decision making","Density measurement","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","iterative methods","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed detection","sensor networks","connectivity graph","small world networks","distributed fusion","parallel architectures","iterative algorithm","random networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Detection in Sensor Networks: Connectivity Graph and Small World Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969388","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Detection in Sensor Networks: Connectivity Graph and Small World Networks","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04045S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599742,"authors":[{"name":"P.W. van Vugt","affiliation":["Dept. of Elec. and Comp.

A Bayesian approach is presented here incorporating both pieces of information, but in which correlations are limited to the transmitter side. The approach yields the existing cases of mean or (transmit) covariance information as special instances. Various cases of mean and covariance information are discussed, including prior mean and covariance (Ricean channel distribution) and posterior mean and covariance (based on a noisy channel estimate and prior covariance information).

The quantized vector, which is conveyed to the transmitter using a low-rate feedback channel, is used for transmission to provide significant diversity and array gain. The codebook for quantization is a function of the channel distribution, and is typically designed for fixed channel distributions. In this paper, we propose a channel adaptive feedback strategy for arbitrary channel distributions, and present a simple codebook design methodology based on the channel statistics. The codebook for quantization is dynamically chosen rom a structured set of pre-designed codebooks, called the code set, wherein all codebooks are derived from one mother codebook. Simulations illustrate that the proposed method can improve error rate performance in correlated and/or channels with strongly line-of-sight components","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599772","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599772.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","startPage":"376","endPage":"380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codebook Adaptation for Quantized MIMO Beamforming Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Codebook Adaptation for Quantized MIMO Beamforming Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599772/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969410","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599772/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codebook Adaptation for Quantized MIMO Beamforming Systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050402S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599773,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In the absence of perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, channel information can be quantized at the receiver and sent back using a low-rate feedback link. In the case of flat-fading channels, considerable work has been done in reducing the feedback information. This work, however, does not naturally extend to the case of frequency selective channels and leads to an explosion in the feedback overhead. In this paper, OFDM is considered as an implementation of linearly precoded MIMO spatial multiplexing systems over frequency selective channels. Two classes of algorithms are discussed for quantizing channel information-clustering and transform. The clustering group the subcarriers and choose a common frequency-domain representation of the channel information for each group. Thus the feedback rate depends on the number of groups and not on the number of subcarriers. The transform algorithms quantize the channel information in time-domain where the transform essentially decorrelates the channel information. Both the algorithms provide significant compression of channel information maintaining bit-error-rate performance close to the case of perfect channel knowledge","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599773","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599773.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for Quantized Precoded MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599773/","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for Quantized Precoded MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969411","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599773/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for Quantized Precoded MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096939S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599774,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The key idea is that a receiver reflects, or \"echoes\", the received signal back to the transmitter, from which it estimates its own outgoing channel fading coefficients for all transmit/receive pairs of antenna elements. The weighted non-linear least squares problem to jointly estimate the outgoing and incoming channels together is solved for the case of frequency-flat fading. The channel estimates are used to obtain a matched pair of maximum ratio transmission/maximum ratio combining (MRT/MRC) weight vectors for cooperative beamforming. Simulation results are given that show the echo MIMO with MRT/MRC approach can outperform a quantized MRT/MRC codebook method. For fully correlated channels, the echo MIMO MRT/MRC transmission scheme approaches the ideal beamformer which uses perfect channel estimates","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599774.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"392","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Echo-MIMO: a Two-Way Channel Training Method for Matched Cooperative Beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Radio transmitters","MIMO","Fading","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Frequency estimation","Wireless communication","Acoustic scattering","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","fading channels","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echo-MIMO","two-way channel training method","matched cooperative beamforming","multiinput multioutput channel sounding method","channel fading coefficients","transmit-receive pairs","antenna elements","weighted nonlinear least squares problem","channel estimation","maximum ratio transmission-maximum ratio","correlated channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","displayDocTitle":"Echo-MIMO: a Two-Way Channel Training Method for Matched Cooperative Beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599774/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8958083","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Echo-MIMO: a Two-Way Channel Training Method for Matched Cooperative Beamforming","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051197S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1599775,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqi Wang","lastName":"Jianqi Wang","id":"37423154400"},{"name":"M.D. Zoltowski","firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Zoltowski","id":"37278519000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0131-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"1599775","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Feedback","Covariance matrix","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Channel state information","Capacity planning","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Gaussian processes","MIMO systems","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity analysis","MIMO channels","covariance feedback","precoding scheme","channel matrix","Gaussian random matrix","nonwhite covariance matrix","receiver feedback","ergodic capacity","eigenvalues","water-filling scheme","spatial multiplexing scheme","3 to 5 dB"]}],"abstract":"In the paper we consider the case of covariance feedback in MIMO communications, where the channel matrix is modelled as a Gaussian random matrix with zero mean and a non-white covariance matrix available at the transmitter through receiver feedback.

In this paper, we propose a water-filling scheme to approximate the capacity-achieving input covariance matrix.

This estimator obtains partial channel information by exploiting LMMSE estimation and finds time-variant channel impulse responses by interpolating the channel information with the discrete orthonormal Legendre polynomials. Furthermore, we propose an iterative LMMSE estimation scheme to significantly improve channel estimation performance.

The decoding algorithm is inherently parallelizable, allowing communication at high speeds. One of the main disadvantages, however, is large memory requirements for interim storing of decoding data. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a hybrid decoding algorithm, using an approximating early decision algorithm and a regular probability propagation algorithm. When the early decision algorithm fails, the block is re-decoded using a probability propagation decoder. As almost all errors are detectable, the error correction performance of the hybrid algorithm is negligibly detonated.

Recently, Hocevar showed by simulations that the convergence rate of the LDPC decoder can be accelerated by exploiting a `turbo-scheduling' applied on the bit-node messages (rows of the parity check matrix). In this paper, we show analytically that the convergence rate for this type of scheduling is about two times increased for most of the regular LDPC codes. Second we prove that `turbo-scheduling' applied on the rows of the parity check matrix is identical belief propagation algorithm as standard message passing algorithm. Furthermore, we propose two new message passing schedules: 1) a turbo-scheduling is applied on the check-node messages (columns of the parity check matrix); and 2) a hybrid version of both previous schedules where the turbo-effect is applied on both check-nodes and bit-nodes.

In this paper, the multiple loop eigenmessage approach is extended using normalized matrices.

Instantaneous channel measurements provide the most potential gain, but suffer from delay-induced error due to channel temporal variation. Statistical channel knowledge provides less gain, but is reliable. In this paper, we propose a framework combining a possibly outdated channel measurement with the channel statistics - the mean and the covariance - to create a dynamic CSIT form, as a function of a correlation factor between the measurement and the current channel. The CSIT consists of an estimate of the current channel and the associated estimation error covariance, which function effectively as the channel mean and covariance.

With the assumptions that all users have the same number of receive antennas and utilize all receive antennas when scheduled for transmission, the number of simultaneously supportable users with BD is limited by the ratio of the number of basestation transmit antennas to the number of user receive antennas. In a downlink MIMO system with a large number of users, the basestation may select a subset of users to serve in order to maximize the total throughput The brute-force search for the optimal user set, however, is computationally prohibitive. We propose two low-complexity suboptimal user selection algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with BD. Both algorithms aim to select a subset of users such that the total throughput is nearly maximized. The first user selection algorithm greedily maximizes the total throughput, whereas the criterion of the second algorithm is based on the channel energy. We show that both algorithms have linear complexity in the total number of users and achieve around 95% of the total throughput of the complete search method in simulations","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599826.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity User Selection Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Block Diagonalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Throughput","Downlink","Broadcasting","Covariance matrix","Transmitting antennas","Channel capacity","Null space","Resistance heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","interference suppression","MIMO systems","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity user selection algorithms","multiuser MIMO systems","block diagonalization","interuser interference","downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output","receive antennas","basestation transmit antennas","brute-force search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity User Selection Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Block Diagonalization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969439","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity User Selection Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Block Diagonalization","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065027S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1599827,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh Tung Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"lastName":"Thanh Tung Kim","id":"37292981600"},{"name":"M.

This concept had already been introduced in symbol detection a decade ago, where it led to unbiased LMMSE receivers and in which case global CU corresponds to zero-forcing.

Time selectivity of the channel causes inter-carrier-interference (ICI) in OFDM, thereby degrading the performance significantly and increasing the computational complexity of the receiver. On the other hand, it introduces temporal and frequency diversity. In this work, a low complexity iterative method is addressed to compensate for the adverse effects of time and frequency selectivity of the channel while achieving the diversity benefits. The method splits the equalization into two stages. The first stage exploits the sparsity present in the channel convolution matrix (CCM) to estimate the time domain transmitted samples and the second stage performs the maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection of the frequency domain symbols.

Since the spreading sequences are cyclostationary, this property can be exploited to derive channel equalization and interference rejection algorithms. Multiple antenna elements can be coupled with adaptive equalization to offer significant performance gains over that achieved by a similar system with only one antenna. In this paper, we investigate a multiple antenna cyclostationary receiver with a parallel architecture for an aperiodic CDMA signal that converts an aperiodic sequence into piecewise periodic sequences. The performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated for a real downlink aperiodic CDMA signal, and it is compared with that of a conventional matched filter (MF) receiver. The number of correctly decoded paging channel messages is used as the performance measure","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599863.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"801","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiple Antenna Cyclostationary Receiver for Aperiodic CDMA Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Multiaccess communication","Adaptive arrays","Interference","Adaptive equalizers","Performance gain","Parallel architectures","Downlink","Matched filters","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","antenna arrays","channel coding","code division multiple access","interference suppression","paging communication","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple antenna cyclostationary receiver","aperiodic CDMA signals","aperiodic code-division multiple-access system","spreading sequences","channel equalization","interference rejection algorithms","adaptive equalization","parallel architecture","paging channel messages"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Multiple Antenna Cyclostationary Receiver for Aperiodic CDMA Signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599863/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969454","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiple Antenna Cyclostationary Receiver for Aperiodic CDMA Signals","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047595S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599864,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the presence of spatial correlation as well as the case where there are more transmit antennae than receive antennae (referred to as overloaded transmission in this paper) the performance of antenna-by-antenna (AA)-based MIMO minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers are, in general, degraded. Therefore, we propose joint-over-antenna (JA) detection-based iterative frequency domain technique to improve the performance of receiver in the presence of overloaded antenna transmission and spatial correlation. The proposed receiver is based on the combination of maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) algorithm, and soft-cancellation (SC) and MMSE filtering for turbo-coded single carrier point-to-point MIMO systems. In the proposed receiver MIMO signal detection is comprised of two stages. At the first stage, inter-symbol interference (ISI) is suppressed with MMSE filtering. At the second stage, co-antenna interference (CAI) is suppressed by the MAP algorithm and transmitter antennae are decomposed each other. Simulation results show that performance gain of JA compared to AA technique is significant in the presence of spatial correlation as well as in overloaded cases. The performance comparison is made in terms of frame error rate (FER) with different antenna configurations and different spatial correlations in point-to-point MIMO frequency-selective fading channels","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Domain Joint-over-Antenna MIMO Turbo Equalization","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599871","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599871.pdf","startPage":"834","endPage":"838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Domain Joint-over-Antenna MIMO Turbo Equalization","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1599871/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969461","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Domain Joint-over-Antenna MIMO Turbo Equalization","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072978S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1599873,"authors":[{"name":"C.B.

We propose an iterative two step procedure alternating between the estimation of the parameters of the specular propagation paths and the parameters of the distributed scattering. For the distributed scattering, the estimator improves at first the estimates of the parameters of the exponential distribution in time-delay domain. Then, using the estimated time-delay parameters, the estimates of the parameters of the angular distributions are improved. The procedure is repeated and the parameters of specular and diffuse scattering components are refined, both in time-delay and angular domains","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599873","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","startPage":"843","endPage":"847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Angular and Time-Delay MIMO Propagation Parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Angular and Time-Delay MIMO Propagation Parameters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969463","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Angular and Time-Delay MIMO Propagation Parameters","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052324S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599874,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

We also illustrate that an SB scheme can potentially be very efficient compared to an exclusively training based scheme since it estimates very few un-constrained parameters. It is then demonstrated that the rank deficiency of the FIM for an irreducible MIMO FIR channel arises because of a unitary (rotation) matrix indeterminacy. Based on this analysis a semi-blind algorithm is proposed for MIMO FIR channel estimation","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599874","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference onSignals, Systems and Computers, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10661/33645/01599874.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2005.1599874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33645","startPage":"848","endPage":"852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIM Regularity for Gaussian Semi-Blind MIMO FIR Channel Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1599874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FIM Regularity for Gaussian Semi-Blind MIMO FIR Channel Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1599874/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969464","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1599874/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FIM Regularity for Gaussian Semi-Blind MIMO FIR Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01599874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085178S","chronDate":"Oct. 28 2005-Nov. 1 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10661","isNumber":"33645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10661","xplore-issue":"33645","articleId":"1599874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1599875,"authors":[{"name":"T.
