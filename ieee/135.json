One computer with many processors or many single-processor computers can reduce the computation time. However, some FDTD cell types, e.g., PML cells, require more computation time than others. Thus, the size and shape of the individual process allocations can significantly influence the computation time. This paper addresses these load balancing issues with static and quasi-dynamic approaches. The message-passing interface (MPI) library is applied to a three-dimensional (3D) FDTD code. Timing results including speedup and efficiency, are presented for trials run on a cluster of sixteen processing nodes and one server node. Two examples are shown in this paper, a power bus with 16 decoupling capacitors and a five layer power distribution network. In such models, the problem size and complexity make modeling with a serial code impractical and time consuming for engineering. Models with several million cells take days to run, but proper implementation, including load balancing, can reduce this execution time to hours on a sufficiently powerful cluster.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2004.1350006","publicationTitle":"2004 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (IEEE Cat.

For the analysis, the clock excitation mechanism was invested by TDR-TDT measurement and simulation with balanced TLM and via coupling model. Also, the power/ground plane edge radiation excited by sweeping from 100 MHz clock to 2900 MHz clock were measured. The power/ground plane edge radiation comes from voltage noise in the power/ground plane. From TDR-TDT investigations, we knew that a transition part in time domain makes the voltage noise, which has a strong relation with power/ground plane impedance depending on plane resonances and return current discontinuity of through-hole signal via. Therefore, the consecutive transitions of the clock make larger noise voltage and edge radiation. The PCB power/ground plane edge radiations of a clock depend on the power/ground plane impedance where the clock spectrum is varied. The higher power/ground plane impedance makes the larger power/ground plane edge radiation, when the clock frequency is fixed. In other words, the clock frequency and its harmonics go into the higher power/ground plane impedance range, the power/ground plane edge radiations are increased by maximum 35 dBm in near field measurement.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2004.1350025","publicationTitle":"2004 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (IEEE Cat.

In order to analyze these effects, an accurate full-wave modeling approach, which includes active devices and passive interconnects (including power and ground planes), is required. We link the equivalent circuit of an active IC into an FDTD algorithm by the equivalent current-source method (ECSM). The radiation behavior of the switched IC on PCB circuits can thus be investigated. It is found that two mechanisms dominate for the radiations of the switched IC. One is the GBN (ground bounce noise) radiation and the other is the signal trace radiation.

A novel interpretation of five-phase to orthogonal axis transformation is presented with the development of main and auxiliary space vector domains. It is shown that the auxiliary space vector domain produces harmonic distortion in the five phase system. A novel space vector modulation strategy is developed to produce voltage in the main domain while cancelling components in the auxiliary domain, resulting in a sinusoidal system. The novel scheme is practically implemented and the production of sinusoidal excitation is demonstrated. Further a dead-banding scheme is also implemented to reduce switching.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20040365","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2004).","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2004).","pdfPath":"/iel5/9342/29680/01350100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20040365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29680","startPage":"650","endPage":"655 Vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of space vector modulation strategies for five phase voltage source inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Development of space vector modulation strategies for five phase voltage source inverters","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2004-April 2 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350100/","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8065847","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of space vector modulation strategies for five phase voltage source inverters","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01350100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039544S","chronDate":"March 31 2004-April 2 2004","isNumber":"29680","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9342","citationCount":"65","articleId":"1350100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350102,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The use of specific voltage sensors can be avoided if the reference voltage signals can be used instead of the actual (measured) phase voltages. Thus, an accurate compensation of inverter nonidealities is of great interest, and it represents the target of this work. The proposed algorithm overcomes the imprecision of the compensation, which arises in most of the existing methods, caused by an advanced sampling of the phase currents polarity with respect to the switching instants. The implementation of the proposed technique has been made possible solely by the use of an FPGA component, which proves, once more, to be a very attractive coprocessor in modern DSP-based digital drives.","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2004).","pdfPath":"/iel5/9342/29680/01350102.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"667 Vol.2","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2004).","doi":"10.1049/cp:20040367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20040367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved FPGA-based dead time compensation for SVM inverters","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","AC motor drives","field programmable gate arrays","digital signal processing chips","machine control","control engineering computing","digital control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensorless AC drives","motor phase voltage","voltage sensor","reference voltage signal","SVM inverter","phase current","FPGA component","DSP-based digital drives","dead time compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2004-April 2 2004","displayDocTitle":"Improved FPGA-based dead time compensation for SVM inverters","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8065848","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved FPGA-based dead time compensation for SVM inverters","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01350102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034151S","chronDate":"March 31 2004-April 2 2004","isNumber":"29680","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9342","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1350102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":1350103,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Rajagopalan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Satish Rajagopalan"},{"name":"W. le Roux","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"W.","lastName":"le Roux"},{"name":"T.G.

The reason for this is that CDD inserts virtual echoes. Due to these virtual multipath components carriers experience different channels if the antenna specific cyclic delays are chosen properly. Without any additional effort this increased frequency selectivity can be exploited by using a forward error correction (FEC) code, e.g., a convolutional code that benefits from an altered error distribution after demodulation. In this paper we investigate a simple multiple antenna transmission scheme that exploits the frequency selectivity of the channel even without FEC coding. On each antenna a shifted version of the signal is sent which enables the receiver to apply optimum demodulation. We analyze the choice of the cyclic delay and present a comparison with the well-known Alamouti scheme.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030228","publicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf.

In this paper, space-time block coding (STBC) techniques are considered as a means of enhancing the performance of COFDM WLAN. To perform channel estimation for multiple transmit and receive antennas, it is necessary to make transmitted pilot signals orthogonal in space and time. This was achieved using a Hadamard design. A time domain least square channel estimator was used to achieve high performance. Packet error rate (PER) performance results for, the case of 2 Tx and 2 Rx antennas are presented and throughput enhancements are evaluated. It is observed that STBC doubles the link throughput for low SNR values. For the case of an 802.11a/g network, results for different packet lengths are also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf. Publ.

A system based on this technology has properties quite different from those of conventional WLAN systems in that every room in a building hosts at least one picocell having its own base station (BS). Thus a challenging problem lies in the medium access control (MAC) protocol design so that it can support QoS requirements as well as a fast and simple handover. In this paper a MAC protocol based on frequency switching (FS) codes is proposed, and constraints on some important parameters are examined. Six variants of the MAC protocol are proposed and discussed.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030247","publicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf. Publ.

However, this requires us to design an efficient flow control and call admission control (CAC). Design of CAC has special difficulties given that capacity in CDMA varies according with the number of active users and the level of interference. Taking into account the stochastic nature of multimedia traffic and the changes in the available capacity in the CDMA system, an effective capacity request is derived and used to characterize the resources required by each mobile user in order to meet its respective QoS requirements. These requirements are expressed in term of rate and delay constraints in addition to the signal to interference ratio. After setting an effective capacity threshold for the system a linear approximation is used to find the total amount of resources required by all the mobile users already admitted in the system and the new connection request. Packet transmission is considered for both real time and nonreal-time services while a centralized demand assignment algorithm has been implemented in order to provide QoS in the packet level. Computer simulation results are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030248","publicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf.

The estimation of carrier phase and symbol timing is based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) theory. The synchronisers perform once per decoding iteration and make iterative use of extrinsic information obtained from the turbo decoder. In this way, the recovery of the carrier phase and symbol timing are integrated into the iteration loop of the turbo decoding and carried out simultaneously with the decoding iteration by iteration. The approach is applied to turbo-coded BPSK system over AWGN channel. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach provides reliable estimation on the phase and timing errors and robust decoding at low SNR values without using additional pilot. symbols. It is shown that this approach outperforms the traditional non-data-aided (NDA) method and the overall BER performance approaches that with ideal synchronisation.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030257","publicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf.

This is a very challenging topic when the successive paths are spaced at less than one chip distance (closely-spaced paths). Traditional delay locked loops (DLLs) are not able to estimate closely-spaced path delays with good accuracy. We introduce an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based algorithm for the estimation of closely-spaced path delays in WCDMA environments. The EKF might be applied either at the sample or at symbol level and it can be also used for the estimation of the complex coefficients of the channel multipaths. The model parameters and the sensitivity to the initialization conditions are described for a practical downlink WCDMA scenario, employing root raised cosine pulse shapes. Simulation results show that EKF is fast convergent both when the estimation is done at symbol or at sample level, and the mean delay error is at most one sample for both cases of oversampling factors of 4 and 8. We show also the conditions when the convergence is not guaranteed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf. Publ.

Here we develop an iterative receiver structure that can combat the different species of interferences at the same time. The proposed receiver is designed following the turbo principle and based on the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) with linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detector serving as its first stage. In every iteration, the soft output of the space-time turbo decoder is fed back to improve the PICs performance. The simulation results suggest that the proposed iterative receiver can suppress the interferences for STTuC CDMA systems effectively. A performance comparison between urban, rural and flat fading channel is also given and the reason of the performance differences is discussed based on the analysis of the interference structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf.

Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna architectures coupled with soft input soft output (SISO) iterative decoding algorithms represent a revolutionary approach to the design of WLANs. At present, these techniques are the subject of intense theoretic research. In this paper, the performance of a newly proposed iterative MIMO-OFDM architecture is explored using MIMO channel data captured in the 5 GHz band. Theoretically, this technology has the potential to significantly increase future WLAN data rates. However, little practical evaluation has been reported in the literature. To address this situation, this paper also describes the construction of a broadband 5 GHz MIMO-OFDM testbed. This advanced baseband/RF platform will be used in the future to evaluate innovative MIMO-OFDM WLAN architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf.

This paper presents the MIMO capacities of an access point, that is Installed at a highway bridge, based on simulated and measured data at a frequency of 5.2 GHz. With the assumption that the same plane waves exist at all antennas of the receiver and the transmitter a simple extrapolation allows one to determine the capacity of a virtual MIMO system with an arbitrary antenna topology, based on SISO channel impulse responses. The validity of this assumption is discussed.

This is achieved at significantly lower complexity and without the need for matrix channel equalization. However for higher-order modulation schemes such as 16- and 64-QAM, the iterative receiver is unable to converge appropriately, while the APP-based receiver performs adequately but at the expense of prohibitive computational complexity. A novel layered encoding scheme is proposed at the transmitter which allows the iterative receiver to operate with higher-order modulations. Here, iterations are performed between the detector and a turbo-decoder. In addition, soft output combining, inherent to the iterative receiver architecture, is optimized so as to maximize the mutual information transfer at each iteration. It is shown that, in conjunction with the layered encoding scheme, the iterative receiver again outperforms the APP-based receiver, at a lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030307","publicationTitle":"2003 5th European Personal Mobile Communications Conference (Conf.

Briefly, it can be stated that all inconveniences of a wireless channel are present, making this channel a very hostile environment. Some innovations used in presented HF modem design are described. Orthogonal multicarrier modulation, specifically, orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM), was applied, and utilization of code division multiple access (CDMA) leads to good use of channel's frequency diversity. A convenient receiver design for this type of modulation is presented as well. With Reed-Solomon channel coding possible modem's useful data rates are approximately 2400 and 3600 bps. Long interleaving and channel coding was avoided in order to achieve interactive transmission of digital voice. This, however, leaves an additional possibility of modem's performance enhancement if interactivity is not the primary goal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of an OFDM-CDMA HF modem","publicationTitle":"2003 Ninth International Conference on HF Radio Systems and Techniques","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030425","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 Ninth International Conference on HF Radio Systems and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/9347/29689/01350414.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20030425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2003","displayDocTitle":"Performance of an OFDM-CDMA HF modem","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"7716596","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of an OFDM-CDMA HF modem","confLoc":"Bath, UK","sourcePdf":"01350414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032529S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2003","isNumber":"29689","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9347","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1350414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350465,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-4070-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1350465","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":43,"totalDownloads":3745},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"LAN/MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society"}],"abstract":"This standard specifies the air interface of fixed broadband wireless access (BWA) systems supporting multimedia services.

This has found successful application in tasks that involve data sets containing huge numbers of features (in the order of tens of thousands), which would be impossible to process further. Recent examples include text processing and Web content classification. One of the many successful applications of rough set theory has been to this feature selection area. This paper reviews those techniques that preserve the underlying semantics of the data, using crisp and fuzzy rough set-based methodologies. Several approaches to feature selection based on rough set theory are experimentally compared. Additionally, a new area in feature selection, feature grouping, is highlighted and a rough set-based feature grouping technique is detailed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350758/","volume":"16","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1350758/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8210764","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction: rough and fuzzy-rough-based approaches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction: rough and fuzzy-rough-based approaches","sourcePdf":"01350758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116443S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"29697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"454","xplore-issue":"29697","articleId":"1350758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1350762,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A good example is a data mining application, where data is sold in pieces to parties specialized in mining it. Different avenues are available, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Enforcement by legal means is usually ineffective in preventing theft of copyrighted works, unless augmented by a digital counterpart, for example, watermarking. While being able to handle higher level semantic constraints, such as classification preservation, our solution also addresses important attacks, such as subset selection and random and linear data changes.

Currently, several commercial systems and publicly available libraries exist to support various flavors of checkpointing. Programmers typically use these systems if they are satisfactory or otherwise embed checkpointing support themselves within the application. In this paper, we project the performance and functionality of checkpointing algorithms and systems as we know them today into the future. We start by surveying the current technology roadmap and particularly how Peta-Flop capable systems may be plausibly constructed in the next few years. We consider how rollback-recovery as practiced today will fare when systems may have to be constructed out of thousands of nodes. Our projections predict that, unlike current practice, the effect of rollback-recovery may play a more prominent role in how systems may be configured to reach the desired performance level. System planners may have to devote additional resources to enable rollback-recovery and the current practice of using \"cheap commodity\" systems to form large-scale clusters may face serious obstacles. We suggest new avenues for research to react to these trends.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/29698/01350776.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2004.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2004.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Checkpointing for peta-scale systems: a look into the future of practical rollback-recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Checkpointing","Application software","Large-scale systems","Computer applications","System performance","Computer Society","Libraries","Programming profession","Fault tolerant systems","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system recovery","multiprocessing systems","fault tolerant computing","software reliability","distributed programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["petascale system checkpointing","rollback recovery","checkpoint restart","scientific workloads","commercial systems","public libraries","petaflop capable systems","system configuration","cheap commodity systems","large-scale clusters","distributed systems","distributed applications","fault tolerance","multiple-processor systems","system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Distributed systems","distributed applications","performance of systems","fault tolerance","modeling techniques","reliability","availability","serviceability","measurement","evaluation","modeling","simulation of multiple-processor systems."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Checkpointing for peta-scale systems: a look into the future of practical rollback-recovery","volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1350776/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April-June 2004","accessionNumber":"8174061","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Checkpointing for peta-scale systems: a look into the future of practical rollback-recovery","sourcePdf":"01350776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08967S","chronDate":"April-June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"29698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"29698","articleId":"1350776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1350778,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Conductors at different levels of the interconnect hierarchy have highly different physical and, consequently, electrical characteristics. These interconnect lines also exhibit inductive behavior due to enhanced switching speed of nanoscale devices, making interconnect design and analysis difficult. The design of robust and area efficient power distribution networks for high-speed integrated circuits has therefore become a challenging task. The impedance characteristics of multilayer power distribution grids and the relevant design implications are the subject of this paper. The power distribution network spans many layers of interconnect with disparate electrical properties. Unlike single-layer grids, the electrical characteristics of multilayer grids vary significantly with frequency. As the frequency increases, a large share of the current flow is transfered from the low-resistance upper layers to the low-inductance lower layers. The inductance of a multilayer grid therefore decreases with frequency, while the resistance increases with frequency. The lower layers of multilayer power grids provide a low-inductance current path, significantly reducing the grid impedance at high frequencies. Multilayer power distribution grids extend to the lower interconnect layers, exhibiting superior high-frequency impedance characteristics as compared to power distribution grids built exclusively within the upper, low-resistance metal layers. A significant share of metal resources to distribute the global power should therefore be allocated to the lower metal layers. An analytic model is also presented to determine the impedance characteristics of a multilayer grid from the inductive and resistive properties of the comprising individual grid layers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1350786/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8219762","volume":"12","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Impedance characteristics of power distribution grids in nanoscale integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance characteristics of power distribution grids in nanoscale integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01350786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072149S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"29699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"29699","articleId":"1350786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350790,"authors":[{"name":"J.-L.

By integrating both the modified Hebbian learning algorithm with the self-feedback function and a ratio memory into CNN architecture, the resultant ratio-memory (RMCNN) is called the self-feedback RMCNN (SRMCNN) which can serve as the associative memory. It can generate the absolute weights and then transform them into the ratioed A-template weights as the ratio memories for recognizing noisy input patterns. Simulation results have shown that with the stronger feature enhancement effect, the SRMCNN under constant leakage current can store and recognize more patterns than the RMCNN. For 18 /spl times/ 18 SRMCNN, 93 noisy patterns with a uniform distribution noise level of 0.8 and a variance of normal distribution noise of 0.3 can be learned, stored, and recognized with 100% success rate. The SRMCNN has greater learning and recognition capability when the learned patterns are simpler and the noise is lower. For the learning and recognition of complicated patterns, the allowable pattern number is decreased for a 100% success rate. Simulation results have successfully verified the correct functions and better performance of SRMCNN in the pattern recognition. With high integration capability and excellent pattern association performance, the proposed SRMCNN can be applied to nanoelectronic associative-memory systems for image processing applications.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2004.836309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2004.836309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/29699/01350790.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Architectural design and analysis of learnable self-feedback ratio-memory cellular nonlinear network (SRMCNN) for nanoelectronic systems","volume":"12","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8219766","htmlLink":"/document/1350790/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural design and analysis of learnable self-feedback ratio-memory cellular nonlinear network (SRMCNN) for nanoelectronic systems","sourcePdf":"01350790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093358S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"29699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"29699","articleId":"1350790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1350795,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Fang Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/29699/1350795/1350795-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuh-Fang Tsai (S'00) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Chun-Yuan Christine University, Chun-Li, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1996 and the M.S. degree in computer science and engineering from Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, in 2002, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Her research interests include leakage power management and power aware VLSI circuit and system designs."]},"lastName":"Yuh-Fang Tsai","id":"37276235700"},{"name":"D.E.

The basic idea is to exploit the functional symmetry of concurrent checkers with respect to their inputs, and to order the inputs such that switching activity (and hence power consumption) in the checker is minimized. The inputs of the checker are usually driven by the outputs of the function logic and check symbol generator logic-spatial correlations between these outputs are analyzed to compute an input order that minimizes power consumption. The reduction in power consumption comes at no additional impact to area or performance and does not require any alteration to the design flow. It is shown that the number of possible input orders increases exponentially in the number of inputs to the checker. As a result, the computational cost of determining the optimum input order can be very expensive as the number of inputs to the checker increases. This paper presents a very effective technique to build a reduced cost function to solve the optimization problem to find a near optimal input order. It scales well with increasing number of inputs to the checker, and the computational costs are independent of the complexity of the checker. Experimental results demonstrate that a reduction in power consumption of 16% on the average for several types of checkers can be obtained using the proposed technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1350796/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8219772","volume":"12","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lowering power consumption in concurrent checkers via input ordering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lowering power consumption in concurrent checkers via input ordering","sourcePdf":"01350796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116895S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"29699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"29699","articleId":"1350796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1350798,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we discuss in detail how SVM, a new learning technique, is successfully applied to load forecasting. In addition, motivated by the competition results and the approaches by other participants, more experiments and deeper analyses are conducted and presented here. Some important conclusions from the results are that temperature (or other types of climate information) might not be useful in such a mid-term load forecasting problem and that the introduction of time-series concept may improve the forecasting.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/29700/01350819.pdf","startPage":"1821","endPage":"1830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2004.835679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2004.835679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load forecasting using support vector Machines: a study on EUNITE competition 2001","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Support vector machines","Temperature","Demand forecasting","Predictive models","Learning systems","Data analysis","Power industry","Computer science","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","support vector machines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["midterm load forecasting","support vector machines","EUNITE Competition 2001","load demand data","SVM","time-series concept"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load forecasting","regression","support vector machines","time series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Load forecasting using support vector Machines: a study on EUNITE competition 2001","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1350819/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209676","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load forecasting using support vector Machines: a study on EUNITE competition 2001","sourcePdf":"01350819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06908S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"29700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"494","xplore-issue":"29700","articleId":"1350819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350822,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.J.

A single neural network, however, may misrepresent part of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by different networks. The use of a \"committee machine\" composed of multiple networks can in principle alleviate such a difficulty. A major challenge for using a committee machine is to properly combine predictions from multiple networks, since the performance of individual networks is input dependent due to mapping misrepresentation. This paper presents a new method in which weighting coefficients for combining network predictions are the probabilities that individual networks capture the true input-output relationship at that prediction instant. Testing of the New England market cleaning prices demonstrates that the new method performs better than individual networks, and better than committee machines using current ensemble-averaging methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2004.837759","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2004.837759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29700","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/29700/01350825.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving market clearing price prediction by using a committee machine of neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350825/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving market clearing price prediction by using a committee machine of neural networks","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1350825/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8209682","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving market clearing price prediction by using a committee machine of neural networks","sourcePdf":"01350825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089201S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"29700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"29700","articleId":"1350825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1350826,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Xiao-Ping Zhang (M'95) received the B.Eng., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Southeast University, China, in 1988, 1990, 1993, respectively.","Currently, he is a Lecturer in the School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K. He was with Nanjing Automation Research Institute (NARI), Ministry of Electric Power, China, working on EMS/DMS advanced application software research and development from 1993 to 1998.","Dr. Zhang was an Alexander-von-Humboldt Fellow at the University of Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany."]},"lastName":"Xiao-Ping Zhang","id":"37087180784"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"1350826","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiterminal voltage-sourced converter-based HVDC models for power flow analysis","abstract":"Two mathematical models for multiterminal voltage-sourced converter (VSC)-based HVDC are proposed in this paper.

Because of the distance involved in wide-area interconnections, communication delay cannot be ignored. Long time delay may be detrimental to system stability and may degrade system performance. The time delay tolerance of a centralized controller and the associated performance tradeoff is analyzed using a small gain criterion. Special attention is paid to the choice of weighting functions in a robust control design. As expected, it is found that time delay tolerance decreases when the system bandwidth increases, while the nominal system time-domain performance is concomitantly improved. Several approaches which can maintain a good system performance while increasing the time delay tolerance are suggested and compared. A modern controller design technique, like gain scheduling via linear matrix inequalities, is evaluated for the design of the supervisory power system stabilizer accounting for various time delays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of time delay effects to wide-area power system stabilizer design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2004.836272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/29700/01350833.pdf","startPage":"1935","endPage":"1941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2004.836272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of time delay effects to wide-area power system stabilizer design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1350833/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209690","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of time delay effects to wide-area power system stabilizer design","sourcePdf":"01350833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08339S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"29700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"281","xplore-issue":"29700","articleId":"1350833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":1350834,"authors":[{"name":"R.G. de Almeida","affiliation":["INESC-Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/29700/1350834/1350834-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rog\u00e9rio G. de Almeida received the B.Sc. degree in 1996 and the M.Sc. degree in 1999, both from the from Federal University of Par\u00e1, Par\u00e1, Brazil.

The transmitted signals can be used for multiple swing mode damping using a single controller. However, there is an unavoidable delay involved before these signals are received at the controller site. To ensure satisfactory performance, this delay needs to be taken into account in the control design stage. This paper focuses on damping control design taking into account a delayed arrival of feedback signals.

The modeling approach is technology independent, fast, and accurate, which makes it suitable for circuit simulators. In the model, two different NN architectures, namely, multilayer perceptron and generalized radial basis function, are used and compared. To increase the training efficiency of the NN, both modular and region partitioning methods have been proposed and utilized. In addition, two approaches for obtaining the transconductance and output conductance of the device are discussed. The first approach makes use of an NN for the conductances, while the second uses the numerical differentiation of the I-V results. To confirm the accuracy of the model, the drain-current characteristics as well as conductances obtained by the model are compared to the simulation data for the points where the NNs are not trained. The comparison shows excellent agreements with relative errors of around 1% over a wide range of drain and gate voltages as well as channel lengths and widths.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2004.836725","startPage":"1580","endPage":"1587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/29701/01350884.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2004.836725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate and efficient modeling of SOI MOSFET with technology independent neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Neural networks","Silicon on insulator technology","Voltage","Table lookup","Paper technology","Circuit simulation","Multilayer perceptrons","Transconductance","Parasitic capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","semiconductor device models","silicon-on-insulator","multilayer perceptrons","circuit simulation","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network modeling","I-V characteristics","silicon-on-insulator MOSFET","circuit simulators","multilayer perceptron","generalized radial basis function","modular partitioning methods","region partitioning methods","numerical differentiation","drain-current characteristics","circuit simulation","technology independent modeling","unified modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit simulation","fully depleted (FD)","neural network (NN) modeling","partially depleted (PD)","silicon-on-insulator (SOI) modeling","technology independent modeling","unified modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Accurate and efficient modeling of SOI MOSFET with technology independent neural networks","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1350884/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8214446","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate and efficient modeling of SOI MOSFET with technology independent neural networks","sourcePdf":"01350884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091077S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"29701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"29701","articleId":"1350884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1350906,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimators for the parameters of interest have been derived by modeling the OFDM signal as a proper complex Gaussian random process. However, when data symbols belong to a real constellation, the received signal becomes an improper complex random process, and hence, previously mentioned estimators, termed cyclic prefix (CP) estimators, are not ML estimators. In this letter, minimum mean-squared error estimators exploiting the conjugate-symmetry property exhibited by the OFDM signal with real data symbols, termed MSR estimators, that greatly outperform CP estimators in additive noise channels, are derived. Moreover, a modified MSR symbol-timing estimator that can assure satisfactory performance in multipath fading channels is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29703/01350906.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29703","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind symbol-timing and frequency-offset estimation in OFDM systems with real data symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind symbol-timing and frequency-offset estimation in OFDM systems with real data symbols","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209043","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1350906/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind symbol-timing and frequency-offset estimation in OFDM systems with real data symbols","sourcePdf":"01350906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042379S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"29703","articleId":"1350906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350907,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Ling","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Cong Ling","id":"37275770000"},{"name":"K.H.

Computer simulation for three different multibeam transmitter configurations and a conventional diffuse transmitter is carried out. Diversity receiver and wide field-of-view (FOV) receiver configurations are evaluated in conjunction with the proposed configurations. For the diversity-detection case, a receiver comprising an array of narrow FOV detectors (three and seven segments) oriented in different directions is used to maximize the collected signals and minimize noise. A novel line-strip multibeam system (LSMS) is investigated with single and diversity receiver configurations, and is compared with other spot-diffusing methods. Combining schemes, including selection combining, maximum ratio combining, and equal gain combining are employed for the presented configurations. Our results indicate that the performance improvement obtained through the use of LSMS with a three-direction diversity receiver is about 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio enhancement over the conventional diffuse system, and 26 dB when combining techniques are used. Root mean square delay-spread performance for the proposed configurations, at different positions on the communication floor, are also evaluated and compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350909/","volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1350909/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8209046","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of diffuse optical wireless channels employing spot-diffusing techniques, diversity receivers, and combining schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of diffuse optical wireless channels employing spot-diffusing techniques, diversity receivers, and combining schemes","sourcePdf":"01350909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049162S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"29703","articleId":"1350909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350913,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

We show that the ergodic capacity for the single-user MISO system is Schur-concave with respect to the vector with eigenvalues of the channel covariance matrix, i.e., the more correlation that exists between the transmit antennas, the less is the achievable capacity. Furthermore, the capacity loss for fully correlated transmit antennas in comparison with the uncorrelated case is derived. The results for the ergodic capacity are compared with the impact of correlation on the outage probability. The relationship between correlation properties and outage probability is more complicated than the relationship between the correlation properties and the ergodic capacity.

It is shown that when the number of subcarriers jammed by narrowband interference is small, the multicarrier receiver without notch filters can work well, due to the gain of frequency diversity from nonjammed subcarriers. On the other hand, when the number of subcarriers jammed by the narrowband interference is large, using notch filters can improve the multicarrier system performance significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29703/01350916.pdf","startPage":"1664","endPage":"1669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicarrier CDMA overlay for ultra-wideband communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350916/","displayDocTitle":"Multicarrier CDMA overlay for ultra-wideband communications","volume":"52","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209053","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1350916/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicarrier CDMA overlay for ultra-wideband communications","sourcePdf":"01350916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053746S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"29703","articleId":"1350916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350917,"authors":[{"name":"M.-H.

In addition, we consider the multiaccess multiantenna system and present some results on the achievable information-rate region. As for the deterministic MIMO ISI channels, we use the binary-input multitrack magnetic recording system as an example, which employs multiple write and read heads for data storage. Our results show that the multitrack recording channels have significant advantages over the single-track channels, in terms of the achievable information rates when the intertrack interference is considered. We further consider practical coding schemes over both stochastic and deterministic MIMO ISI channels, and compare their performance with the information-theoretical limits.

Joint detection of the desired and cochannel signals is a useful approach to improving receiver performance, thus increasing system capacity. In this paper, we show that a practical single-antenna joint-detection receiver can provide significant gains in system capacity for the time-division multiple-access (TDMA) standard Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industry Association/Interim Standard-136 (TIA/EIA/IS-136 or IS-136). For a sectorized system, joint detection provides a capacity gain of 47% in a typical urban environment. When used in conjunction with transmit beamforming, the synergy between the two approaches leads to a capacity gain of over 200%. In determining these gains, practical aspects of the IS-136 system are considered, namely, unsynchronized networks, limited receiver complexity, and adaptability. A semiblind acquisition process, which uses the training sequence of the desired user only, is employed, because the desired and interfering base stations are not synchronized. The receiver complexity is controlled by processing only one sample per symbol period, even though it is shown that multiple samples per symbol period should ideally be used. Finally, because receiver performance may be limited by its own intersymbol interference instead of CCI, an adaptive joint-detection process is used which selects between joint demodulation and single-user equalization for each slot.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29703/01350922.pdf","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1732","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive joint detection of cochannel signals for TDMA handsets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive joint detection of cochannel signals for TDMA handsets","volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1350922/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209059","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive joint detection of cochannel signals for TDMA handsets","sourcePdf":"01350922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109293S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"29703","articleId":"1350922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1350925,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["ICORE Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/29703/1350925/1350925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nBo Hu (S'02) received the B.S. degree in 1998, and the M.Sc. degree in 2001, from Xi'an Jiao-tong University, Xi'an, China, both in information and communication engineering.

The Gaussian approximation is shown to be inaccurate for predicting bit-error rates (BERs) for medium and large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. The performances of TH pulse position modulation (PPM) and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation schemes are accurately compared in terms of the BER.

Using a filter-bank decomposition concept, we introduce an effective algorithm that can identify both the forward and the reverse channels based only on this feedback information.

In this paper, we contribute three main themes to the power control problem. First, we derive an efficient algorithm for computing minimal power levels for large-scale networks within seconds. Nice and intuitive conditions for the existence of feasible power solutions follow from this approach. Second, we define the capacity region of a network by the set of effective spreading gains, or data rates, respectively, which can be supplied by the network. This is achieved by bounding the spectral radius of a certain matrix containing system parameters and mutual transmission gain information. It is shown that the capacity region is a convex set. Finally, we reveal an interesting duality between the uplink and downlink capacity region. In a clear-cut analytical way, it substantiates the fact that the uplink is the more restricting factor in cellular radio networks. The same methods carry over to certain models of soft handover. In the case that the channel gains are subject to log-normal shadowing, we introduce the concept of level-/spl alpha/ capacity regions. Despite the complicated structure, it can still be shown that this set is sandwiched by two convex sets coming arbitrarily close as variance decreases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29703/01350927.pdf","startPage":"1777","endPage":"1785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control, capacity, and duality of uplink and downlink in cellular CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Quality of service","Computer networks","Large-scale systems","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Base stations","Shadow mapping","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","channel capacity","radio links","cellular radio","code division multiple access","telecommunication control","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","uplink capacity","downlink capacity","cellular CDMA systems","code-division multiple-access","large-scale networks","uplink-downlink duality","log-normal shadowing","log-normal fading","soft handover"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity region","cellular networks","code-division multiple access (CDMA)","convexity","log-normal fading","soft handover"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Power control, capacity, and duality of uplink and downlink in cellular CDMA systems","volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1350927/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209064","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control, capacity, and duality of uplink and downlink in cellular CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01350927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121152S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"29703","articleId":"1350927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1350928,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

System A is quadrature phase-shift keyed modulated and has a linear block channel coder. A minimum mean-squared error receiver is also employed in this system. System B is binary phase-shift keyed modulated. Rate-compatible punctured convolutional codes and soft-decision Viterbi decoding are used for channel coding in system B. The two systems are analyzed for both an additive white Gaussian noise channel and a flat Rayleigh fading channel. The performances of the systems are evaluated using the end-to-end mean squared error. A tight upper bound for frame-error rate is derived for nonterminated convolutional codes for ease of analysis of system B.

The joint estimation of these parameters is investigated using a weighted-least-squares approach. The exact solution turns out to be too complex for practical purposes, as it involves a numerical search over a bidimensional domain. As an alternative, we propose a suboptimal procedure, in which the propagation delay is first computed with a monodimensional search and then is exploited to derive the frequency offset in closed form. Both data-aided and nondata-aided estimation methods are considered. The proposed synchronizers have a reasonable complexity and are suited for third-generation cellular systems. Their performance is assessed by simulation in a scenario inspired by the specifications of the frequency-division duplexing component of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems standard. It is found that they provide accurate estimates and are useful even in applications over rapidly varying channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29703/01350930.pdf","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency estimation and timing acquisition in the uplink of a DS-CDMA system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Frequency estimation and timing acquisition in the uplink of a DS-CDMA system","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1350930/","accessionNumber":"8209067","volume":"52","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency estimation and timing acquisition in the uplink of a DS-CDMA system","sourcePdf":"01350930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084114S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"29703","articleId":"1350930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1350931,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Two classifications are discussed: decoded relaying versus amplified relaying, and multihop channels versus multihop diversity channels. The channel models are compared, through analysis and simulations, with the \"singlehop\" (direct transmission) reference channel on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio, probability of outage, probability of error, and optimal power allocation. Each of the four channel models is shown to outperform the singlehop reference channel under the condition that the set of intermediate relaying terminals is selected intelligently. Multihop diversity channels are shown to outperform multihop channels. Amplified relaying is shown to outperform decoded relaying despite noise propagation. This is attributed to the fact that amplified relaying does not suffer from the error propagation which limits the performance of decoded relaying channels to that of their weakest link.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29703/01350931.pdf","startPage":"1820","endPage":"1830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop diversity in wireless relaying channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350931/","displayDocTitle":"Multihop diversity in wireless relaying channels","volume":"52","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209068","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1350931/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop diversity in wireless relaying channels","sourcePdf":"01350931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083464S","chronDate":"Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"518","xplore-issue":"29703","articleId":"1350931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350960,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

Air-coupled resonance measurements were then performed to reveal the acoustic parameters of the individual layers that were identified within this multilayered structure. These data were then incorporated into a conventional linear model, and this has been verified and used to study performance and produce designs.

Fabrication on silicon provides a means for electronics integration via post-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing without sacrificing device performance. Fabrication on quartz reduces parasitic capacitance and allows the use of optical displacement detection methods for CMUTs. The simple, low-temperature process uses metals both as the sacrificial layer for improved dimensional control, and as the bottom electrode for good electrical conductivity and optical reflectivity. This, combined with local sealing of the vacuum cavity by plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition of silicon nitride, provides excellent control of lateral and vertical dimensions of the CMUTs for optimal device performance. In this paper, the fabrication process is described in detail, including process recipes and material characterization results. The CMUTs fabricated for intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging in the 10-20 MHz range and interdigital CMUTs for microfluidic applications in the 5-20 MHz range are presented as device examples. Intra-array and wafer-to-wafer process uniformity is evaluated via electrical impedance measurements on 64-element ring annular IVUS imaging arrays fabricated on silicon and quartz wafers. The resonance frequency in air and collapse voltage variations are measured to be within 1% and 5%, respectively, for both cases. Acoustic pressure and pulse echo measurements also have been performed on 128 /spl mu/m/spl times/32 /spl mu/m IVUS array elements in water, which reveal a performance suitable for forward-looking IVUS imaging at about 16 MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/29704/01350961.pdf","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1350961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1350961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1350961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low temperature fabrication of immersion capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers on silicon and dielectric substrates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic transducers","Silicon","Dielectric substrates","Optical device fabrication","Ultrasonic imaging","Optical imaging","Plasma temperature","Acoustic imaging","Acoustic measurements","Acoustic pulses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic transducer arrays","interdigital transducers","capacitive sensors","microfluidics","CMOS integrated circuits","plasma CVD","ultrasonic imaging","electric impedance measurement","acoustic noise measurement","echo"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low temperature fabrication","capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","silicon substrate","dielectric substrate","quartz substrates","immersion applications","electronics integration","post-complementary metal oxide semiconductor process","quartz reduces parasitic capacitance","optical displacement detection","sacrificial layer","dimensional control","electrical conductivity","optical reflectivity","vacuum cavity","plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition","silicon nitride","optimal device","intravascular ultrasound imaging","microfluidic applications","intra array","wafer-wafer process","electrical impedance measurement","annular IVUS imaging arrays","quartz wafers","resonance frequency","pulse echo measurements","water","250 degC","5 to 20 MHz","Si","SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1350961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Low temperature fabrication of immersion capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers on silicon and dielectric substrates","volume":"51","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1350961/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8217862","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low temperature fabrication of immersion capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers on silicon and dielectric substrates","sourcePdf":"1350961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057248S","chronDate":"Oct.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"29704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"29704","articleId":"1350961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1350962,"authors":[{"name":"W.

For this application antenna array architecture design, calibration, and a maximum likelihood channel parameter estimation framework (RIMAX) is described. Depending on the available measured dimensions, the algorithm estimates the four coefficients of the polymetric path weight matrix, the direction of arrival, the direction of departure, the time delay of arrival, and the Doppler-shift of the specular paths. Moreover, the parameters of a statistical model of the dense multipath components resulting from distributed diffuse scattering are estimated.

It leads to inferior image quality in comparison to image from other sensors of similar resolution. Previous design and post-chip attempts to correct this type of noise have been either impractical or resulted in other complexities. However, FPN correction can be attempted using an accurate model approach for the response of this type of pixel. A three parameter model, previously suggested for logarithmic pixels, has been tried for this purpose. In this paper a simple parameter extraction procedure is proposed using this model to calibrate and correct FPN. The result is a model that works well over six decades of illumination but fails at high photocurrents. It is shown that this is caused by a breakdown in an assumption used to create the three parameter models. Consequently, a new four parameter model is developed that fits the data over six decades, and is usable in FPN correction for many wide current range applications that require complete and accurate characterisation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of high dynamic range logarithmic CMOS image sensors","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (IEEE Cat.

The sensor system is composed of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted on the foot instep and a biaxial accelerometer mounted on the waist. The IMU integrates a biaxial accelerometer and a rate gyroscope. Both the foot gyroscope and the waist accelerometer are capable to accurately estimate the cadence. Strapdown integration applied to the inertial data allows to reconstruct the trajectory in the sagittal plane of the sensed anatomical point on the foot, yielding the opportunity to determine the desired walking features. Double-integration of the waist accelerometer signals to determine the trunk vertical displacement and root mean square analysis of the waist acceleration modulus allow to construct two predictors of the walking speed, which integrate the information gathered from the inertial estimator. In this paper, preliminary results concerning the accuracy of level walking speed prediction by different methods are presented.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2004.1351203","pdfPath":"/iel5/9320/29627/01351203.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"883 Vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (IEEE Cat.

Their measurement no longer requires a sinusoidal signal as test stimulus but a digitally modulated signal of the same type the RF amplifier has to operate with. The reliability of the new parameters is assessed through a number of experiments conducted on a RF amplifier, mainly addressed to very wide bandwidth industrial and commercial applications.

In this paper a genetic algorithm, implemented in a Mathcad environment, performs the evaluation of the risk indexes from the processed line signals. The combination of genetic algorithms and neural network is also investigated as a promising possibility for the development of a reliable diagnostic tool.

The FPGA board is connected to the host computer through a PCI interface. The application system software running within Microsoft Windows environment is developed so that all the data generated during simulation can be downloaded and displayed on the host computer. Hence, the system acts like a logic analyzer with very large storage memory. Furthermore, the software provides interfaces and drivers for devices such as USB camera, computer monitor and PC soundcard so that the simulation data can be demonstrated over the host computer in real time. Because multimedia data is usually complicated and the size is huge, design and thorough verification are usually difficult and take lots of time. The proposed system is both versatile and convenient to use and verification of designs for multimedia applications becomes much easier. An MPEG-4 simple profile video encoder and a 3D surround sound processor are realized with the proposed system. Both cases can run in real time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Versatile PC/FPGA based verification/fast prototyping platform with multimedia applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (IEEE Cat.

The regular repetitive structure of a RAM array is considered because it shows major yield improvements with the introduction of redundancy. Two repair yield evaluation formulas for a 1D redundant array are introduced and compared; the first one is based on Markov modeling, the second one is based on an approximation.","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2004.1351355","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 21st IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (IEEE Cat.

We report a simple op-amp based circuit implementation of the new transimpedance amplifier together with the results of its noise and bandwidth characterization. The comparison between these measurements with those obtained on a conventional transimpedance amplifier has confirmed that the proposed approach allows to obtain lower background noise and larger bandwidth for the same transimpedance gain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1351478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1351478/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8082996","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improved trade-off between noise and bandwidth in op-amp based transimpedance amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved trade-off between noise and bandwidth in op-amp based transimpedance amplifier","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"01351478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040915S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9320","isNumber":"29628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9320","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"29628","articleId":"1351478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1351490,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Negative Pressure Wave (NPW) in pressure curve can be an indication of leakage of a pipeline. In this paper, we propose to use the support vector machine (SVM) learning to detect NPW in pressure curves. In the approach, NPWs detection is formulated as a supervised-learning problem and the method of SVM is employed to develop the detection algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated using a database of 1500 pressure curves containing 500 NPWs. Experimental results demonstrate that, when compared to the Wavelet based methods, the proposed SVM framework offers the better performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1351546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1351546/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8083050","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of support vector machine learning to leak detection and location in pipelines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of support vector machine learning to leak detection and location in pipelines","confLoc":"Como","sourcePdf":"01351546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052432S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9320","isNumber":"29628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9320","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"29628","articleId":"1351546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1351634,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jian, China"],"lastName":"Wen Zhang"},{"name":"Yutian Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jian, China"],"lastName":"Yutian Liu"},{"name":"M.

The high-resolution TDR uses an expensive programmable delay chip or a complex Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) circuit to capture the waveform with very fine time interval. The Vernier time delay generation technique using two crystal oscillators of slightly different frequency is proposed, which is simpler and more cost-effective and provides subpicosecond time resolution. One of the two clocks is used for the reference time to generate incident periodic pulses, and another clock is used for the sampling, The implemented RES circuit consists of the Vernier clock generator, the pulse generator and the control logic for pulse generation, interface and high-speed memory control. Using the ADC of relatively low sampling rate, the periodic pulse waveform is reconstructed with tens of GSPS high equivalent sampling rate by the repetitive sampling utilizing the incremental Vernier time delay. The performance of RES circuit is measured through the operation of TDR. The resolution of the RES circuit is 16.8ps equal to 59.5GSPS sampling rate, which means that the signal waveform in the 66.7%VOP RG58C/U cable can be sampled by 1.6mm interval.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Delay effects","Pulse generation","Clocks","Pulse circuits","Time domain analysis","Propagation delay","Oscillators","Frequency","Logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","time-domain reflectometry","nuclear electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["16ps-resolution Random Equivalent Sampling circuit","TDR","Vernier time delay generation","high-resolution Time-Domain Reflectometer","expensive programmable delay chip","complex Time-to-Digital Converter circuit","very fine time interval","pulse generator","control logic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1351912","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

A low-noise fast discharge technique is used: the return to the high-value feedback resistor (R/sub F/) Comes from a non-inverting low-gain (A) amplifier cascaded to the principal charge-amplifier loop. This yields a reduction of the fall time of a factor A, with no changes of C/sub F/ and R/sub F/ and no added noise. The shorter fall time reduces the pile-up effects in presence of high event rates. Special care has been devoted to the matching between the high capacitance of the detector and that of the input stage of the preamplifier. To match a high capacitance, four BF862 FET's have been connected in parallel.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1351913","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

This detector has 24,000 channels of time and amplitude readout, and operates in a high singles count-rate environment. This system continuously digitizes the incoming pulses of every channel, using a latency buffer to temporarily hold all digitized information. Channel occupancy information for each event is also sent to a local external logic analyzer, and can become part of the trigger decision. All the stored data in the latency buffer is read with zero-suppression to local RAM upon presentation of a valid trigger. The system can be self-triggered or triggered by a coincidence of the internal occupancy signal with an external gate. The data readout provides sub-nanosecond timing and 6-8 bit amplitude resolution, and the system clock can be varied between 15-75 MHz. This design will be implemented in an ASIC due to the large number of readout channels, the requirement initial parallel data flow due to the high single rates, and the number of memory buffers. The digitizer is to be controlled by a FPGA. This paper presents the conceptual design of this system. We anticipate that the ASIC can be used for many other applications requiring the acquisition of time and waveform signals in high counting rate environments, such as PET, CZT, or other HEP experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1351924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2003","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1351924/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"8066794","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A pipelined front-end, timing and amplitude digitizing system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pipelined front-end, timing and amplitude digitizing system","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01351924.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048343S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"9356","isNumber":"29713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9356","xplore-issue":"29713","articleId":"1351924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1351926,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The first design is a high precision operational amplifier focusing on the voltage offset. It is a continuous time auto-zero stabilized architecture, that leads to a typical input offset voltage of 2 /spl mu/V-100nV//spl deg/C. The amplifier with its output buffer consumes 5mW at a supply voltage of +/- 2.5V. The gain bandwidth product is 2MHz while the slew rate is respectively -6V/ /spl mu/s and +8.8V/ /spl mu/s on 10pF with 10K/spl Omega/ load. This amplifier is suitable for the control of large dynamic (>10/sup 5/) calibration signal, and for very low DC signal instrumentation. The second design is a current mode charge pulse amplifier based on a second generation positive current conveyor topology (CCII). The bandwidth, the dynamic range and the output impedance have been optimized using an enhanced cascode current mirror. The preamplifier provides two outputs: one for the signal integration, and another going through a current comparator for a digital counting flow. The double hit resolution is less than Ins. An auto-zero compensation has been added to this preamplifier to control its output current offset down to 60nA. The total power dissipation (preamplifier + offset cancelation + comparator) is less than 1mW. This second amplifier has been designed for low power space applications, especially EUSO (Extreme Universe Space Observatory), which use multianode PMT in the configuration of a large gate time (2.5 /spl mu/s) open for charge integration.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low voltage","Pulse amplifiers","Preamplifiers","CMOS technology","Bandwidth","Space charge","Operational amplifiers","Calibration","Instruments","Pulse generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auto-zero stabilized CMOS amplifiers","very low voltage","current offset","auto-zero architecture","high precision operational amplifier","voltage offset","continuous time auto-zero stabilized architecture","slew rate","charge integration","2.5 V","10 pF","10 kohm","60 nA","1 mW","2.5 mus"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1351987","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

The TDC uses a delay chain and register array structure to produce lower bits in addition to higher bits from a clock counter. Lacking the direct controls custom chips, the FPGA implementation of the delay chain and register array structure had to address two major problems: (1) The logic elements used for the delay chain and register array structure must be placed and routed by the FPGA compiler in a predictable manner, to assure uniformity of the TDC binning and short-term stability. (2) The delay variation due to temperature and power supply voltage must he compensated for to assure long-term stability. We used the chain structures in the existing FPGAs that the venders designed for general purpose such as carry algorithm or logic expansion to solve the first problem. To compensate for delay variations, we studied several digital compensation strategies that can be implemented in the same FPGA device. Some bench-top test results will also be presented in this document.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Firmware-only implementation of time-to-digital converter (TDC) in field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352025","startPage":"177","endPage":"181 Vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29714","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

This can be achieved by digitizing the signal from individual detectors using 100-MHz 8-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and processing the data in field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Various digital implementation of filters and baseline restorers have been combined with numerical least mean square fit to the data to extract the time of interaction and the energy deposited in BGOAPD detectors. Using the same detector and pre-amplifier, a time resolution of 7.2 ns was obtained with digital techniques, as compare to 12.7 ns with the conventional analog method. By reducing the BGO-BGO coincidence time window by more than /spl sim/40 %, an equivalent reduction of the rate of random events can be obtained, which would improve image SNR significantly at high counting rate in a BGO-APD PET scanner. The proposed digital techniques can be readily adapted to other faster detectors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time determination of BGO-APD detectors by digital signal processing for positron emission tomography","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

It is difficult to use two input windows within the ANN structure for the contamination corrections of /sup 99m/Tc//sup 123/I images acquired using only two photo-peak energy windows. In this work, we designed a new ANN network with 24 inputs, and 32 nodes in the hidden layer and two nodes in the output layer, to correct for scatter and cross-talk contaminations on /sup 99m/Tc//sup 123/I images acquired using two photo-peak windows. We trained the network using experimentally acquired /sup 99m/Tc and /sup 123/I spectrum data using RSD brain phantom. The neural network package Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNSv4.2), from the University of Stuttgart, was used for the neural network training and the cross-talk corrections. Two sets of image data were tested: one was a human activation images and the other was a cylindrical striatal phantom. Our results show a great improvement on both the human activation and the cylindrical striatal phantom images.

The results showed that our method could separate /sup 99m/Tc and /sup 123/I with an error of about 4% The results promised to enable us to make clinical trials with dual radionuclides.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352244","startPage":"1872","endPage":"1876 Vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

To avoid the need for successive PET and CT scans, we have investigated the possibility of acquiring both the anatomic and functional images using the same detection system, based on conventional PET detectors and electronics operated in photon counting mode. The detector consisted of a high-luminosity LSO scintillator individually coupled to an avalanche photodiode to enable low-energy X-ray detection at high-count rate. A simulator was set up to collect tomographic data using a monochromatic 60 keV source (/sup 241/Am) to irradiate a phantom made of tissue-equivalent materials. The measured spatial resolution with this non-optimized setup was nearly 1 mm, demonstrating the capability to provide fairly accurate anatomical localization in CT counting mode. The images obtained showed that the three main constituents of a biological body (bones, water and air) can be clearly identified with a dose significantly lower than with conventional CT operated in current mode. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of dual-modality PET/CT imaging based on PET detectors and electronics, and confirm that substantial dose reduction would be possible by acquiring the CT image in photon counting mode.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1352315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8153054","htmlLink":"/document/1352315/","conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2003","displayDocTitle":"CT acquisition using PET detectors and electronics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CT acquisition using PET detectors and electronics","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01352315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070769S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"9356","isNumber":"29715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9356","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"29715","articleId":"1352315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1352379,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Several groups have previously proposed a 2 stage process for motion correction: acquiring the data in list-mode and realigning the events according to the known motion before binning them into a sinogram, followed by reconstruction of the sinogram. However, motion correction of the sinogram data can result in parts of the sinogram not being filled for the full duration of the time frame. This results in image artefacts. We suggest ways to remove these artefacts by either reprojecting data or by determining scale factors for the partially measured parts of the sinogram, or a combination of both. We test this on simulations, phantom data and one patient study.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352379","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium. Conference Record (IEEE Cat.

For high resolution iterative image reconstruction with large amount of sample events, computing the projections event-by-event is an extremely time consuming task. This work presents a novel ray-tracing calculation technique applying to a list-mode EM image reconstruction algorithm as a part of the system model to accelerate its projection operations. Compared to both the conventional Siddon algorithm and its accelerated methods, the new algorithm has less average computation operation time on each voxel. The results show that the new algorithm significantly improves the calculation speed up to twice as fast than the incremental Siddon algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

A LROC curve can then be fitted. The area under the LROC gives an indication of the observer performance for the given set of images. A large number of images is needed for a human observer study, e.g. 100 for the study itself and 50 as a training set. The simulation or measurement of all of these images is very time consuming and/or impractical. In a previous paper, we proposed the bootstrap method as a means to create a number of list mode files from one simulation, and showed that these files can be used to evaluate the LROC performance of a CNPW numerical observer. In this paper, we investigate whether the bootstrapped images can be used to evaluate human observer performance. We found that human performance was inferior on bootstrapped images compared to noisy images. However, by substituting for the noisy background with a smoothed version of this background, human observer performance becomes comparable to performance with noisy realizations of the images. We can therefore conclude that bootstrapped images, with a smoothed background, can be used as an alternative for noise realizations for human observer studies.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352546","startPage":"3070","endPage":"3073 Vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

The modularity allows the assembly of scanners of different sizes and characteristics in order to fit the specific needs of the individual member institutions. Now a first demonstrator is being completed in Julich. The system performs depth of interaction detection by using a phoswich arrangement combining LSO and LuYAP scintillators which are coupled to multi-channel photomultipliers (PMTs). A free-running ADC digitizes the signal from the PMT and the complete scintillation pulses are sampled by an FPGA and sent with 20 MB/S to a PC for preprocessing. The pulse provides information about the gamma energy and the scintillator material which identifies the interaction layer. Furthermore, the exact pulse starting time is obtained from the sampled data. This is important as no hardware coincidence detection is implemented. All single events are recorded and coincidences are identified by software. An advantage of that is that the coincidence window and the dimensions of the field of view can be adjusted easily. The ClearPET/spl trade/ demonstrator is equipped with 10240 crystals on 80 PMTs. This paper presents an overview of the data acquisition system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ClearPET/spl trade/ data acquisition","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

It is important to detect the cancer in its early stage. X-ray three-dimensional (3D) mammography can provide a good image resolution and contrast However, the associated radiation is relatively high. Reduction of the soft X-ray radiation for 3D mammography has been a research focus in the past years. In a typical 3D mammography system, the X-ray source and detector rotate around the object (breast) beneath the table, on which the patient lies in a prone position. In order to sample the data as close as possible to the chest base, a circular orbit with half cone-beam geometry has been investigated. It can provide very good reconstruction if the X-ray source is far away from the object. For a relatively short distance between the source and the object for an improved spatial resolution, the circular orbit may not be an optimal choice. In this case, the portion far away from the circular orbit wouldn't be well reconstructed because of the missing of projection data in that region. In this work, we investigated five possible orbits, attempting to find an optimal orbit that can reconstruct satisfactorily the whole object with least projections (less radiation). The results showed that two near half-circular orbits may be a choice, one near the chest base and the other near the breast tip. The redundant samplings beyond 180/spl deg/ were eliminated by our algorithm, rendering very good reconstructions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352578","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

Preliminary computation estimates suggest that reconstruction of a single frame in one hour is achievable. Careful evaluation of this system will define which factors play an important role in producing high resolution, low-noise images with quantitative accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

The MAF method is applicable to multi-frame PET data acquired dynamically, and also to list mode data that have been sorted into multiple frames. The MAF method compensates very effectively for frame-to-frame motion, but cannot compensate for intra-frame motion, i.e. motion that occurs during the acquisition of a frame. We have investigated the use of list mode acquisition and LOR rebinning (in which individual list mode events are spatially transformed to compensate for changes in head position) as a way of overcoming the limited temporal discrimination of the MAF method. The feasibility of LOR rebinning was assessed in a list mode scan of the Hoffman brain phantom in which multiple 6 degree-of-freedom (d.f.) movements were applied to the phantom during acquisition. The LOR-rebinned data were stored in a 3D sinogram, rebinned to 2D with Fourier rebinning (FORE) and reconstructed with filtered backprojection (FBP). The resulting images exhibited a marked reduction in distortion, but appeared noisier and had poorer contrast than motion-corrected images produced with the MAF method. This was attributed to the loss of events during LOR rebinning (24% of the total), and spatial approximations in associating transformed LORs with sinogram elements. LOR rebinning combined with list mode ML-EM reconstruction was explored as an alternative method because it does not require transformed events to be stored in sinogram format, and thus avoids count losses and spatial approximations. Results from an initial implementation of a list mode ML-EM reconstruction algorithm are presented.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2003.1352598","publicationTitle":"2003 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

Therefore, lowering overall system cost at network processing nodes and maximizing network utilization - hence revenues - remain extremely important objectives. To address these issues, new semiconductor devices called network processing units (NPUs) have emerged. They are optimized to provide programmable processing of protocol data units (PDUs) in networks with diverse requirements while efficiently supporting current and emerging protocols and services. NPUs promise to deliver an ASICs speed with a CPU's programmability, thus augmenting the capacity and features of network nodes that forward and manipulate data traffic. The Programmable Protocol Processor (PRO3) system reduces the overhead incurred by common \"BRUTE-FORCE\" architectures by using the least-required hardware resources for certain common well-defined tasks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PR03: a hybrid NPU architecture","doi":"10.1109/MM.2004.55","startPage":"20","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MM.2004.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel5/40/29729/01353200.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2004","displayDocTitle":"PR03: a hybrid NPU architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1353200/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2004","accessionNumber":"8200772","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PR03: a hybrid NPU architecture","sourcePdf":"01353200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06324S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"40","isNumber":"29729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"29729","articleId":"1353200","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353221,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This problem can be solved sequentially in O(mn) time and O(m+n) space, where m and n are the lengths of the sequences to be aligned. The fastest known parallel space-optimal algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment takes optimal O(m+n/p) space, but suboptimal O((m+n)/sup 2//p) time, where p is the number of processors. On the other hand, the most space economical time-optimal parallel algorithm takes O(mn/p) time, but O(m+n/p) space. We close this gap by presenting an algorithm that achieves both time and space optimality, i.e. requires only O((m+n)/p) space and O(mn/p) time. We also present an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm on an IBM xSeries cluster. Although presented in the context of full sequence alignments, our algorithm is applicable to other alignment problems in computational biology including local alignments and syntenic alignments. It is also a useful addition to the range of techniques available for parallel dynamic programming.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space and time optimal parallel sequence alignments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2004.86","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/29731/01353240.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2004.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Space and time optimal parallel sequence alignments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1353240/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8227760","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space and time optimal parallel sequence alignments","sourcePdf":"01353240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062792S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","isNumber":"29731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1353240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353253,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The proposed model, i.e., contextual recursive cascade correlation (CRCC), a generalization of the recursive cascade correlation (RCC) model, is able to partially remove the causality assumption by exploiting contextual information stored in frozen units. We formally characterize the properties of CRCC showing that it is able to compute contextual transductions and also some causal supersource transductions that RCC cannot compute. Experimental results on controlled sequences and on a real-world task involving chemical structures confirm the computational limitations of RCC, while assessing the efficiency and efficacy of CRCC in dealing both with pure causal and contextual prediction tasks. Moreover, results obtained for the real-world task show the superiority of the proposed approach versus RCC when exploring a task for which it is not known whether the structural causality assumption holds.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2004.837783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/29733/01353277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2004.837783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29733","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contextual processing of structured data by recursive cascade correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Contextual processing of structured data by recursive cascade correlation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8186808","pubMedId":"15565768","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353277/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contextual processing of structured data by recursive cascade correlation","sourcePdf":"01353277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074506S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"29733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"29733","articleId":"1353277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353280,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, the models in the literature are not able to deal with structured organization of information, that is typically required by symbolic processing. In many application domains, the patterns are not only structured, but a fuzziness degree is attached to each subsymbolic pattern primitive. The purpose of this paper is to show how recursive neural networks, properly conceived for dealing with structured information, can represent nondeterministic fuzzy frontier-to-root tree automata. Whereas available prior knowledge expressed in terms of fuzzy state transition rules are injected into a recursive network, unknown rules are supposed to be filled in by data-driven learning. We also prove the stability of the encoding algorithm, extending previous results on the injection of fuzzy finite-state dynamics in high-order recurrent networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8197149","pubMedId":"15565771","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1353280/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Encoding nondeterministic fuzzy tree automata into recursive neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoding nondeterministic fuzzy tree automata into recursive neural networks","sourcePdf":"01353280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135517S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"29733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"29733","articleId":"1353280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1353281,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Since the dynamic characteristics and motor parameters of the LPCM are highly nonlinear and time varying, an adaptive hybrid control system is therefore designed based on a hypothetical dynamic model to achieve high-precision position control. The architecture of DRCMAC network is a modified model of a cerebellar-model-articulation-computer (CMAC) network to attain a small number of receptive-fields. The novel idea of this study is that it employs the concept of diagonal recurrent neural network (DRNN) in order to capture the system dynamics and convert the static CMAC into a dynamic one. This adaptive hybrid control system is composed of two parts. One is a DRCMAC network controller that is used to mimic a conventional computed torque control law due to unknown system dynamics, and the other is a compensated controller with bound estimation algorithm that is utilized to recover the residual approximation error for guaranteeing the stable characteristic. The effectiveness of the proposed driving circuit and control system is verified with hardware experiments under the occurrence of uncertainties. In addition, the advantages of the proposed control scheme are indicated in comparison with a traditional integral-proportional (IP) position control system.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2004.837784","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1506","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/29733/01353285.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2004.837784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive hybrid control for linear piezoelectric ceramic motor drive using diagonal recurrent CMAC network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Ceramics","Motor drives","Control systems","Adaptive systems","Torque control","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Position control","Resonant inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","linear motors","motor drives","piezoelectric motors","recurrent neural nets","resonant invertors","torque control","machine control","approximation theory","cerebellar model arithmetic computers","nonlinear control systems","time-varying systems","position control","PI control","electric machine analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive hybrid control","linear piezoelectric ceramic motor drive","diagonal recurrent CMAC network","cerebellar-model-articulation-computer network","two-inductance two-capacitance resonant inverter","torque control law","bound estimation algorithm","residual approximation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive hybrid control","cerebellar-model-articulation-computer (CMAC)","diagonal recurrent","linear piezoelectric ceramic motor (LPCM)","LLCC resonant inverter"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Ceramics","Computer Simulation","Decision Support Techniques","Electrochemistry","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Feedback","Logistic Models","Motion","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Transducers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive hybrid control for linear piezoelectric ceramic motor drive using diagonal recurrent CMAC network","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1353285/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8197153","pubMedId":"15565776","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive hybrid control for linear piezoelectric ceramic motor drive using diagonal recurrent CMAC network","sourcePdf":"01353285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080992S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"29733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"29733","articleId":"1353285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1353286,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Kai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Naval Academy, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/29733/1353286/1353286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuan-Kai Lin was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1967.

However, in practice, this may not be always feasible as optical lenses, especially those with long focal lengths, only have a limited depth of field. One common approach to recover an everywhere-in-focus image is to use wavelet-based image fusion. First, several source images with different focuses of the same scene are taken and processed with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Among these wavelet decompositions, the wavelet coefficient with the largest magnitude is selected at each pixel location. Finally, the fused image can be recovered by performing the inverse DWT. In this paper, we improve this fusion procedure by applying the discrete wavelet frame transform (DWFT) and the support vector machines (SVM). Unlike DWT, DWFT yields a translation-invariant signal representation. Using features extracted from the DWFT coefficients, a SVM is trained to select the source image that has the best focus at each pixel location, and the corresponding DWFT coefficients are then incorporated into the composite wavelet representation. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional approach both visually and quantitatively.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2004.837780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2004.837780","startPage":"1555","endPage":"1561","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/29733/01353290.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusing images with different focuses using support vector machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Fusing images with different focuses using support vector machines","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353290/","accessionNumber":"8197158","pubMedId":"15565781","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353290/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusing images with different focuses using support vector machines","sourcePdf":"01353290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083955S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"29733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"29733","articleId":"1353290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1353320,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

By adding an auxiliary winding in the coupled inductor, a switch, and a capacitor, the hard-switching design is converted into a soft-switching one. The technique utilizes the leakage inductance of the flyback coupled inductor to create zero-current-switching conditions for all switches in both power flow directions, leading to reduced switching losses, stresses, and electromagnetic interference.

This is an important step toward realizing a truly modular power system architecture, where low-power, low-voltage, building block modules can be connected in any series/parallel combination at input or at output, to realize any given system specifications. A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual input voltage loops, is proposed to achieve input voltage and load current sharing. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective input voltage loops. The average of converter input voltages, which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for input voltage loops. This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops. The input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is analyzed using the incremental negative resistance model of DC/DC converters. Based on the analysis, design methods for input voltage controller are developed. Analysis and proposed design methods are verified through simulation, and experimentally, on an ISOP system consisting of two forward converters.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2004.836671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/29735/01353337.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2004.836671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29735","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active input-voltage and load-current sharing in input-series and output-parallel connected modular DC-DC converters using dynamic input-voltage reference scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active input-voltage and load-current sharing in input-series and output-parallel connected modular DC-DC converters using dynamic input-voltage reference scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209721","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353337/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active input-voltage and load-current sharing in input-series and output-parallel connected modular DC-DC converters using dynamic input-voltage reference scheme","sourcePdf":"01353337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057522S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"29735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"29735","articleId":"1353337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":1353338,"authors":[{"name":"Wanfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/29735/1353338/1353338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wanfeng Zhang (S'95) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 1990 and 1995, respectively, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D degree at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.","He was with HIT as a Lecturer from 1995 to 2000.

One main advantage is that the digital control PFC implementation based on this control strategy can operate at a high switching frequency which is not directly dependent on the processing speed of DSP. Input voltage feed-forward compensation makes the output voltage insensitive to the input voltage variation and guarantees sinusoidal input current even if the input voltage is distorted.

The average power method with slow update rate is used in order to overcome the sensitivity about voltage and current measurement errors. In addition, a harmonic droop scheme for sharing harmonic content of the load currents is proposed based on the voltages and currents control algorithm.

The estimated phase incremental inductance is compared to an analytical model, which represents the functional relationships between the phase incremental inductance, phase current, and rotor position, to estimate the rotor position. The presented sensorless control scheme requires neither extra hardware nor huge memory space for implementation. It can provide accurate rotor position information even as the magnetic characteristics of the SRM change due to aging. Combined with other inductance model-based sensorless control techniques, the proposed method can be used to develop an inductance model-based sensorless control scheme to run the SRM from standstill to high-speed.

It is concluded that the proposed topology produces better dynamic performance, such as small overshoot and fast transient time, than the conventional proportional/integral/derivative (PID) controller in its overall operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2004.836619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/29735/01353354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2004.836619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29735","startPage":"1614","endPage":"1627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new robust algorithm to improve the dynamic performance on the speed control of induction motor drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new robust algorithm to improve the dynamic performance on the speed control of induction motor drive","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8209738","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353354/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new robust algorithm to improve the dynamic performance on the speed control of induction motor drive","sourcePdf":"01353354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065386S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"29735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"29735","articleId":"1353354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353356,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/29735/1353356/1353356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tae-Hyung Kim (S'00\u2013M'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Korea University, Seoul, in 1994 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2003, all in electrical engineering.","Since 2003, he has been a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Advanced Vehicle and Motor Drives Research Center, Texas A&M University.

OCDMA has been investigated for local area networks, access networks, and, more recently, as a packet label for emerging networks. Two-dimensional (2-D) OCDMA codes are preferred in current research because of the flexibility of designing the codes and their higher cardinality and spectral efficiency (SE) compared with direct sequence codes based on on-off keying and intensity modulation/direct detection, and because they lend themselves to being implemented with devices developed for wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) transmission (the 2-D codes typically combine wavelength and time as the two dimensions of the codes). This paper shows rigorously that 2-D wavelength/time codes have better SE than one-dimensional (1-D) CDMA/WDM combinations (of the same cardinality). Then, the paper describes a specific set of wavelength/time (W/T) codes and their implementation. These 2-D codes are high performance because they simultaneously have high cardinality (/spl Gt/10), per-user high bandwidth (>1 Gb/s), and high SE (>0.10 b/s/Hz). The physical implementation of these W/T codes is described and their performance evaluated by system simulations and measurements on an OCDMA technology demonstrator. This research shows that OCDMA implementation complexity (e.g., incorporating double hard-limiting and interference estimation) can be avoided by using a guard time in the codes and an optical hard limiter in the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2004.837296","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/29736/01353376.pdf","startPage":"2409","endPage":"2419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2004.837296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance optical CDMA system based on 2-D optical orthogonal codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"High-performance optical CDMA system based on 2-D optical orthogonal codes","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353376/","accessionNumber":"8215689","volume":"22","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance optical CDMA system based on 2-D optical orthogonal codes","sourcePdf":"01353376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105032S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"29736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"29736","articleId":"1353376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1353377,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The objective is to combine high-speed optical transmission and physical interfaces (PHY) with a medium access control (MAC) protocol, designed to meet the service guarantees in future metropolitan-area networks (MANs). Ethernet is an ideal candidate for the extension into the MAN as it allows seamless compatibility with the majority of existing LANs. The proposed extension of the MAC protocol focuses on backward compatibility as well as on the exploitation of the wavelength domain for routing of variable traffic demands. The high bit rates envisaged will easily exhaust the capacity of a single optical fiber in the C band and will require network algorithms optimizing the reuse of wavelength resources. To investigate this, four different static and dynamic optical architectures were studied that potentially offer advantages over current link-based designs. Both analytical and numerical modeling techniques were applied to quantify and compare the network performance for all architectures in terms of achievable throughput, delay, and the number of required wavelengths and to investigate the impact of nonuniform traffic demands. The results show that significant resource savings can be achieved by using end-to-end dynamic lightpath allocation, but at the expense of high delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Next-generation 100-gigabit metro ethernet (100 GbME) using multiwavelength optical rings","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2004.836809","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/29736/01353377.pdf","startPage":"2420","endPage":"2434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2004.836809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Next-generation 100-gigabit metro ethernet (100 GbME) using multiwavelength optical rings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1353377/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8215690","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Next-generation 100-gigabit metro ethernet (100 GbME) using multiwavelength optical rings","sourcePdf":"01353377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104285S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"29736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"29736","articleId":"1353377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353379,"authors":[{"name":"R.

An overestimation of the Q-factor of signals impaired with optical noise may occur if the averaging effects due to nonideal sampling affect only the noise component of the monitored signal. It is shown that this problem can be rectified using a correction factor, dependent only on the receiver parameters. This allows reasonable Q-factor estimates using sampling systems with aperture times close to the monitored signal bit period. Nonideal sampling may also affect the signal component of the monitored signal. For such cases, a novel and accurate technique is presented to estimate the Q factor using asynchronous histograms, which takes into account changes in the shape of the monitored signal due to averaging effects. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the proposed technique achieving Q-factor estimates within a 14% error margin, independently of the sampling aperture for the considered range. Distortion affecting the signal due to the transmission system can also be handled by the new technique presented in this paper. It is verified that the impact of intersymbol interference due to chromatic dispersion or electrical filtering in the receiver on the performance of the system is well reflected by the estimated Q factor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Optical fiber networks","Sampling methods","Intersymbol interference","Q factor","Optical noise","Apertures","Optical receivers","Histograms","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","monitoring","intersymbol interference","Q-factor","sampling methods","optical distortion","metropolitan area networks","optical dispersion","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance monitoring","optical networks","asynchronously acquired samples","nonideal sampling systems","intersymbol interference","asynchronous Q-factor","optical noise","averaging effects","correction factor","receiver parameters","asynchronous histograms","Q-factor estimates","optical distortion","transmission system","chromatic dispersion","electrical filtering","wavelength division multiplexing","metropolitan optical networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude histogram","asynchronous sampling","intersymbol interference (ISI)","performance monitoring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2004.837291","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/29736/01353379.pdf","startPage":"2452","endPage":"2459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2004.837291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance monitoring in optical networks using asynchronously acquired samples with nonideal sampling systems and intersymbol interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance monitoring in optical networks using asynchronously acquired samples with nonideal sampling systems and intersymbol interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353379/","volume":"22","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353379/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8215692","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance monitoring in optical networks using asynchronously acquired samples with nonideal sampling systems and intersymbol interference","sourcePdf":"01353379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060902S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"29736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"29736","articleId":"1353379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1353383,"authors":[{"name":"Xing-Zhi Qiu","affiliation":["Department of INTEC, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/29736/1353383/1353383-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xing-Zhi Qiu (M'98) received the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from Ghent University, Gent, Belgium, in 1993.","She joined the INTEC design laboratory of Ghent University in 1986.

This architecture provides practical migration steps from current-generation time-division multiplexing (TDM)-passive optical network (PONs) to future WDM optical access networks. The architecture is backward compatible for users on existing TDM-PONs, while simultaneously capable of providing upgraded high-bandwidth services to new users on DWDM-PONs through advanced WDM techniques. The SUCCESS architecture is based on a collector ring and several distribution stars connecting the CO and the users. A semipassive configuration of the Remote Nodes (RNs) enables protection and restoration, making the network resilient to power failures. A novel design of the OLT and DWDM-PON ONUs minimizes the system cost considerably: 1) tunable lasers and receivers at the OLT are shared by all ONUs on the network to reduce the transceiver count and 2) the fast tunable lasers not only generate downstream data traffic but also provide DWDM-PON ONUs with optical CW bursts for their upstream data transmission. Results from an experimental system testbed support the feasibility of the proposed SUCCESS architecture. Also, simulation results of the first SUCCESS DWDM-PON MAC protocol verify that it can efficiently provide bidirectional transmission between the OLT and ONUs over multiple wavelengths with a small number of tunable transmitters and receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8215701","htmlLink":"/document/1353388/","displayDocTitle":"SUCCESS: a next-generation hybrid WDM/TDM optical access network architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SUCCESS: a next-generation hybrid WDM/TDM optical access network architecture","sourcePdf":"01353388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087556S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"29736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"29736","articleId":"1353388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1353389,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, California, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/29736/1353389/1353389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Xue (M'01) received the B.E, M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1992, 1995 and 1998, respectively.","Previously, he worked as a Research Associate with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong.

In addition, real-time performance monitoring based on the strong correlation between the bit-error rates of the optical label and those of the data payload indicates its application in optical time-to-live detection for loop mitigations.

Among several types of high-speed access network technologies, wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON) is the most favorable for the required bandwidth in the near future. Furthermore, WDM technologies, such as athermal arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) and low-cost light source, have matured enough to be applied in the access network. In this paper, the authors propose and implement a WDM-PON system as a platform for TPS. The system employs an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)-injected Fabry-Pe/spl acute/rot laser diode scheme. It has 32 channels of 125 Mb/s and adopts Ethernet as Layer 2. Multicast and virtual local area network features are used for the integration of services such as Internet protocol high-definition broadcast, voice-over Internet protocol, video on demand, and video telephone. The services were demonstrated using the WDM-PON system.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2004.834504","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/29736/01353390.pdf","startPage":"2582","endPage":"2591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2004.834504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber-to-the-home services based on wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Fiber-to-the-home services based on wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network","volume":"22","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8215703","htmlLink":"/document/1353390/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber-to-the-home services based on wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network","sourcePdf":"01353390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057277S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"29736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"263","xplore-issue":"29736","articleId":"1353390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353392,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While these innovations may herald a more aggressive transformation of the network infrastructure, there remain business and technical challenges that must be addressed before wider scale deployments will occur. The challenges facing large carriers are borne mainly out of the characteristics of their existing infrastructure and the business processes that have developed over the years to support that infrastructure and the services that run over it. These challenges fall into one of four major categories: 1) ensuring service demand viability, 2) minimizing the investment risk, 3) the implied business process re-engineering, and 4) access network constraints. Opportunities for continued technical innovations to address these challenges exist; however, not all challenges are addressable with new technologies: the technical transformations of the network must be accompanied by the appropriate business transformations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29736","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/29736/01353392.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2004.837294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2004.837294","startPage":"2606","endPage":"2616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deployment challenges for access/metro optical networks and services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353392/","displayDocTitle":"Deployment challenges for access/metro optical networks and services","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353392/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"8215705","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deployment challenges for access/metro optical networks and services","sourcePdf":"01353392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101211S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"29736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"29736","articleId":"1353392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1353394,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Analysis shows that nonuniform phase coding can increase the orthogonality of the code set, thereby reducing the impact of the MUI.

This diversity includes thousands of different fin designs which are largely the product of natural selection for locomotor performance. Fish fins can be grouped into two major categories: median and paired fins. Fins are typically supported at their base by a series of segmentally arranged bony or cartilaginous elements, and fish have extensive muscular control over fin conformation. Recent experimental hydrodynamic investigation of fish fin function in a diversity of freely swimming fish (including sharks, sturgeon, trout, sunfish, and surfperch) has demonstrated the role of fins in propulsion and maneuvering. Fish pectoral fins generate either separate or linked vortex rings during propulsion, and the lateral forces generated by pectoral fins are of similar magnitudes to thrust force during slow swimming. Yawing maneuvers involve differentiation of hydrodynamic function between left and right fins via vortex ring reorientation. Low-aspect ratio pectoral fins in sharks function to alter body pitch and induce vertical maneuvers through conformational changes of the fin trailing edge. The dorsal fin of fish displays a diversity of hydrodynamic function, from a discrete thrust-generating propulsor acting independently from the body, to a stabilizer generating only side forces. Dorsal fins play an active role in generating off-axis forces during maneuvering. Locomotor efficiency may be enhanced when the caudal fin intercepts the dorsal fin wake. The caudal fin of fish moves in a complex three-dimensional manner and evidence for thrust vectoring of caudal fin forces is presented for sturgeon which appear to have active control of the angle of vortices shed from the tail. Fish are designed to be unstable and are constantly using their control surfaces to generate opposing and balancing forces in addition to thrust. Lessons from fish for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) design include: 1) location of multiple control surfaces distributed widely about the center of mass, 2) design of control surfaces that have a high degree of three-dimensional motion through a flexible articulation with the body, 3) the ability to modulate fin surface conformation, and 4) the simultaneous use of numerous control surfaces including locating some fin elements in the downstream wake generated by other fins. The ability to manufacture an AUV that takes advantage of these design features is currently limited by the nature of available materials and mechanical drive trains. But future developments in polymer artificial muscle technology will provide a new approach to propulsor design that will permit construction of biomimetic propulsors with conformational and articulational flexibility similar to that of fish fins.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2004.833219","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/29737/01353410.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"571","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2004.833219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Morphology and experimental hydrodynamics of fish fin control surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Morphology and experimental hydrodynamics of fish fin control surfaces","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8237484","publicationDate":"July 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353410/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Morphology and experimental hydrodynamics of fish fin control surfaces","sourcePdf":"01353410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111361S","chronDate":"July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"29737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"210","xplore-issue":"29737","articleId":"1353410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1353417,"authors":[{"name":"F.A.

Actuator materials that employ voltage, field, light, or temperature driven dimensional changes to produce forces and displacements are suggesting new approaches to propulsion and maneuverability. Fundamental properties of these new materials are presented, and examples of potential undersea applications are examined in order to assist those involved in device design and in actuator research to evaluate the current status and the developing potential of these artificial muscle technologies. Technologies described are based on newly explored materials developed over the past decade, and also on older materials whose properties are not widely known.

If the hydrophone array of the sonar is to be mounted on a miniaturized autonomous underwater vehicle, the aperture size of the array must be small enough so that it will not affect the vehicle's maneuverability. However, a small aperture size of the array results in poor angular resolution when using the conventional delay and sum beamforming technique. This paper shows that, with the aid of spatial resampling, narrow-band adaptive beamforming algorithms can be applied to improve the angular resolution of wide-band active sonars with a small aperture uniform linear hydrophone array. Owing to the motion of the vehicle and the highly nonstationary environment, only single-snapshot adaptive beamforming algorithms can be used. In this paper, spatial smoothing is used in conjunction with the minimum variance distortionless response and multiple signal classification adaptive beamforming algorithms to produce a high-resolution image using a single ping. Real sonar images generated using these two algorithms are compared with those generated using another single-snapshot adaptive beamforming algorithm, spatial processing: optimized and constrained, and the conventional delay and sum beamforming algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353435/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","volume":"29","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"8237506","publicationDate":"July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353435/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive array processing for wide-band active sonars","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive array processing for wide-band active sonars","sourcePdf":"01353435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073952S","chronDate":"July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"29737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"29737","articleId":"1353435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353437,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

This paper extends previous work by making use of temporal information present in the data to improve performance. The system begins by cleaning the imagery, which is done by tracking objects on the sea bed in the imagery and using this information to obtain an improved estimate of the motion of the vessel. Once the vessel's motion is accurately known, the imagery is cleaned by temporally averaging the images after motion compensation. The detector consists of two stages. After the first detection stage has identified possible objects of interest, a bank of Kalman filters is used to track objects in the imagery and to supply sequences of feature vectors to the final detection stage. A recurrent neural network is used for the final detection stage. The feedback loops within the recurrent network allow the incorporation of temporal information into the detection process. The performance of the proposed system is shown to exceed the performances of other models for the final detection stage, including nonrecurrent networks that make use of temporal information supplied in the form of temporal feature vectors. The proposed detection system attains a probability of detection of 77.0% at a mean false-alarm rate of 0.4 per image.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2004.831616","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/29737/01353437.pdf","startPage":"857","endPage":"871","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2004.831616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A recurrent neural network for detecting objects in sequences of sector-scan sonar images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"A recurrent neural network for detecting objects in sequences of sector-scan sonar images","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8225657","publicationDate":"July 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353437/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recurrent neural network for detecting objects in sequences of sector-scan sonar images","sourcePdf":"01353437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080675S","chronDate":"July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"29737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"29737","articleId":"1353437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1353448,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

Here, recorded domains are constrained by the geometry of the magnetic island and not the geometry of the recording head. Conventional two-dimensional readout modeling techniques, using the reciprocity integral, rely on the assumption that the across-track medium magnetization is uniform under the giant magnetoresistive replay head. However, in the case of a geometrically constrained medium this is not the case. This work investigates the effect that the island geometry has on the characteristics of the replay signal in perpendicular patterned magnetic media storage through the extension of the reciprocity integral to three dimensions. The paper describes replay pulses that offer different characteristics from those obtained by conventional two-dimensional techniques. The origins of these differences are explained by the variation in medium magnetization across the track.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2004.835697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/29738/01353466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2004.835697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29738","startPage":"3551","endPage":"3558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of island geometry on the replay signal in patterned media storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of island geometry on the replay signal in patterned media storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8225585","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353466/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of island geometry on the replay signal in patterned media storage","sourcePdf":"01353466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050452S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"29738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"29738","articleId":"1353466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1353467,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.

Code rate optimality is in the sense of maximizing the information-theoretic user density along a track. To arrive at such results, we compute the achievable information rates for the Lorentzian channel as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and channel density, and then use these information rate calculations to obtain optimal code rates and maximal linear user densities. We call such (hypothetical) optimal codes \"Shannon codes.\" We then examine optimal code rates on a Lorentzian channel assuming low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes instead of Shannon codes. We employ as our tool extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts, which provide a simple way of determining the capacity limit (or decoding threshold) for an LDPC code. We demonstrate that the optimal rates for LDPC codes coincide with those of Shannon codes and, more important, that LDPC codes are essentially capacity-achieving codes on the Lorentzian channel. Finally, we use the above results to estimate the optimal bit-aspect ratio, where optimality is in the sense of maximizing areal density.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353467/","accessionNumber":"8225586","displayDocTitle":"Optimal code rates for the Lorentzian channel: Shannon codes and LDPC codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal code rates for the Lorentzian channel: Shannon codes and LDPC codes","sourcePdf":"01353467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07945S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"29738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"29738","articleId":"1353467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1353468,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

A short length of wire formed the antenna while a beam lead Schottky diode across a resonant loop formed the frequency doubler circuit yielding a total tag mass of less than 3 mg. Simulators using the method-of-moments for the antenna, finite-integral time-domain for the loop, and harmonic balance for the nonlinear diode element were used to predict and optimize the transceiver performance. This performance is compared to the ideal case and to measurements performed using a pulsed magnetron source within an anechoic chamber. A method for analysis of the tag is presented and used to optimize the design by creating the largest possible return signal at the second harmonic frequency for a particular incident power density. These methods were verified through measurement of tags both in isolation and mounted on insects. For excitation at 9.41 GHz the optimum tag in isolation had an antenna length of 12 mm with a loop diameter of 1 mm which yielded a harmonic cross-section of 40 mm/sup 2/. For tags mounted on Colorado potato beetles, optimum performance was achieved with an 8 mm dipole fed 2 mm from the beetle attached end. A theory is developed that describes harmonic radar in a fashion similar to the conventional radar range equation but with harmonic cross-section replacing the conventional radar cross-section. This method provides a straightforward description of harmonic radar system performance as well as provides a means to describe harmonic radar tag performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic radar transceiver design: miniature tags for insect tracking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.835166","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29739/01353476.pdf","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.835166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic radar transceiver design: miniature tags for insect tracking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1353476/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8208760","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic radar transceiver design: miniature tags for insect tracking","sourcePdf":"01353476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050772S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"29739","articleId":"1353476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":1353477,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A space-frequency approach for analyzing wireless communication channels operating in the EHF band is presented. Propagation of the electromagnetic radiation is studied in the frequency domain, enabling consideration of ultrawide-band modulated signals. The theory is employed for the analysis of a communication channel operating at EHF which utilizes pulse amplitude modulated signals. The atmospheric absorptive and dispersive effects on pulse propagation delay, pulse width and distortion are discussed.

These materials were predicted to have many unusual electromagnetic properties, among them amplification of the near-field of a point source, which could lead to the perfect reconstruction of the source field in an image [J. Pendry, Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 85, pp. 3966, 2000]. Often systems containing BW materials are simulated using the finite-difference time-domain technique. We show that this technique suffers from a numerical artifact due to its staggered grid that makes its use in simulations involving BW materials problematic. The pseudospectral time-domain technique, on the other hand, uses a collocated grid and is free of this artifact. It is also shown that when modeling the dispersive BW material, the linear frequency approximation method introduces error that affects the frequency of vanishing reflection, while the auxiliary differential equation, the Z-transform, and the bilinear frequency approximation method produce vanishing reflection at the correct frequency. The case of vanishing reflection is of particular interest for field reconstruction in imaging applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29739/01353493.pdf","startPage":"2955","endPage":"2962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.835274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.835274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference and pseudospectral time-domain methods applied to backward-wave metamaterials","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Metamaterials","Magnetic materials","Frequency","Reflection","Image reconstruction","Approximation methods","Permittivity","Permeability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","permittivity","magnetic permeability","differential equations","approximation theory","electromagnetic wave propagation","Z transforms","metamaterials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain method","FDTD","pseudospectral time-domain method","backward-wave metamaterial","electric permittivity","magnetic permeability","electromagnetic property","differential equation","Z-transform","bilinear frequency approximation method","imaging application","double-negative material"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backward-wave (BW) material","double-negative material","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","left-handed material","metamaterial","pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference and pseudospectral time-domain methods applied to backward-wave metamaterials","volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1353493/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8208777","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference and pseudospectral time-domain methods applied to backward-wave metamaterials","sourcePdf":"01353493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106873S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"29739","articleId":"1353493","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353494,"authors":[{"name":"Guilin Sun","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, Department of Electric and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/29739/1353494/1353494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guilin Sun (M'98\u2013S'01) was born in China in 1962.

The \"approximate-decoupling method\" solves two tridiagonal matrices and computes only one explicit equation for a full update cycle.

It has the same numerical dispersion relation as the previously-reported Crank-Nicolson-Douglas-Gunn algorithm, which solves for the magnetic field. The cycle-sweep method has much smaller numerical anisotropy than the approximate-decoupling method, though the dispersion error is the same along the axes as, and larger along the 45/spl deg/ diagonal than ADI-FDTD. With different formulations, two algorithms for the approximate-decoupling method and four algorithms for the cycle-sweep method are presented. All the six algorithms are strictly nondissipative, unconditionally stable, and are tested by numerical computation in this paper.

Such analysis can be carried out by combining the finite element method (FEM) with the method of moments (MoM), which yields finite element-boundary integral (FE-BI) formulations. A general framework is presented, within which stationary FE-BI formulations can be established (variational boundary-value problems), which relate to equivalent, underlying variational principles (stationary functionals). The formulations are shown to be accurate, robust and computationally efficient. They avoid the problem of interior resonances without resorting to the combined field integral equation and they result in symmetric system matrices, which preserve reciprocity explicitly. Thus, the stationary FE-BI framework combines the FEM and MoM on the continuous level, as opposed to the usual approach of hybridization after discretization, which generally leads to asymmetric matrices. The stationary FE-BI framework allows one to solve either for the electric and magnetic fields on the volume of the problem domain, or for one volume and one exterior surface field quantity, with only marginal differences in computational cost. The volume-surface formulations have the same storage requirements as previous FE-BI formulations and can be more efficiently solved. The volume-volume formulations provide simultaneous solutions of the electric and magnetic fields, which could for instance be used to construct error estimators directly based on Maxwell's equations.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.835140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29739/01353502.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.835140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29739","startPage":"3037","endPage":"3047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the variational formulation of hybrid finite element-boundary integral techniques for electromagnetic analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the variational formulation of hybrid finite element-boundary integral techniques for electromagnetic analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8208786","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1353502/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the variational formulation of hybrid finite element-boundary integral techniques for electromagnetic analysis","sourcePdf":"01353502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10902S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"29739","articleId":"1353502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1353504,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

Transient scattering responses are composed of damped sinusoids at late times and impulse-like components at early times. Due to the impulse-like components, it is difficult to extract meaningful damped sinusoids when analyzing the complete data set. In this paper, the entire time-domain response is used to extract the signal parameters of interest utilizing both the early and late times. The fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), especially the half Fourier transform (HFT), is used to analyze the data for parameter identification. Impulse or Gaussian-like pulses can be easily separated from the late time damped exponentials in the HFT domain, as they have similar functional representations. In addition, the damped exponentials have a turn on time which needs to be solved for. Results from two examples show that the new technique is applicable for signals that are composed of damped exponentials with a turn-on time and short pulse-like components.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.835165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29739/01353510.pdf","startPage":"3109","endPage":"3121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.835165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting early time response using the fractional Fourier transform for analyzing transient radar returns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353510/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting early time response using the fractional Fourier transform for analyzing transient radar returns","volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8208794","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353510/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting early time response using the fractional Fourier transform for analyzing transient radar returns","sourcePdf":"01353510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089693S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"29739","articleId":"1353510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353513,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The proposed structure retains the advantage of laying the coplanar patch and coplanar waveguide (CPW) feed line on the same surface, which makes direct integration with other devices easier. In addition, the substrate thickness of the radiating patch can be adjusted to achieve a wider impedance bandwidth while the dimensions of the CPW feed line are kept unchanged. Simulation has been done by using commercial electromagnetic (EM) simulation software. Four testing antennas, which have centre frequency at about 10 GHz, were designed. The four testing antennas had the same total thickness, but different thickness combinations. From the measured return loss, gain, and radiation patterns of the antennas, it was demonstrated that different thickness combinations do not affect the characteristics of the antennas seriously. Therefore, the dimensions of the CPW feed structure of the antennas can be adjusted individually and can be selected for different applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broad-band double-layered coplanar patch antennas with adjustable CPW feeding structure","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2004.834392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/29739/01353518.pdf","startPage":"3153","endPage":"3156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2004.834392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Broad-band double-layered coplanar patch antennas with adjustable CPW feeding structure","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1353518/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8208802","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broad-band double-layered coplanar patch antennas with adjustable CPW feeding structure","sourcePdf":"01353518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048087S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"29739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"29739","articleId":"1353518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1353527,"authors":[{"name":"K.-K.M.

A polynomial curve-fitting method was also developed for correcting the error. Results indicate that multiple reflections dominate the displacement measurement error. The sensor was able to measure speed as low as 27.7 mm/s, corresponding to 6.6 Hz in Doppler frequency, with an estimated velocity resolution of 2.7 mm/s. A digital quadrature mixer (DQM) was configured as a phase-detecting processor, employing a quadrature sampling signal-processing technique, to overcome the nonlinear phase response problem of a conventional analog quadrature mixer. The DQM also enables low Doppler frequency to be measured with high resolution. The Doppler frequency was determined by applying linear regression on the phase sampled within only fractions of the period of the Doppler frequency. Short-term stability of the microwave signal source was also considered to predict its effect on measurement accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2004.837153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29740","startPage":"2503","endPage":"2512","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/29740/01353533.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2004.837153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the development of a multifunction millimeter-wave sensor for displacement sensing and low-velocity measurement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave measurements","Displacement measurement","Integrated circuit measurements","Wavelength measurement","Frequency","Millimeter wave integrated circuits","Millimeter wave technology","Velocity measurement","Microwave integrated circuits","MMICs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","displacement measurement","MMIC","polynomials","regression analysis","velocity measurement","signal sampling","error correction","measurement errors","frequency measurement","millimetre wave detectors","Doppler shift","radiowave interferometry","frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multifunction millimeter wave sensor","displacement sensor","low velocity measurement","displacement measurement error","monolithic microwave integrated circuits","polynomial curve fitting method","multiple reflections","Doppler frequency","digital quadrature mixer","phase detecting processor","quadrature sampling signal processing technique","nonlinear phase response problem","analog quadrature mixer","linear regression","short term stability","microwave signal source","error correction","35.6 GHz","27.7 mm/s","6.6 Hz","2.7 mm/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Displacement measurement","millimeter-wave sensor","radio interferometry","velocity measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"On the development of a multifunction millimeter-wave sensor for displacement sensing and low-velocity measurement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1353533/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8216909","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the development of a multifunction millimeter-wave sensor for displacement sensing and low-velocity measurement","sourcePdf":"01353533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071725S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"29740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"29740","articleId":"1353533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1353534,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The second-iteration Moore rat-race coupler occupies only 12.6% of the conventional coupler's area, while the area of the second-iteration Sierpinski branch-line coupler is 24.7% of the conventional case. On the other hand, a nine-section Minkowski coupled-line balun is confined in 60% of the conventional balun's area. However, the effective size reduction depends on the used space-filling curve, compression ratio, and associated coupling between segments. The performance of the proposed space-filling hybrids is as good as that of the corresponding conventional structures, and even better in some cases. The design and simulation of the proposed space-filling hybrids have been performed using a moment-method-based full-wave electromagnetic simulator. Measurements of one fabricated coupler prototype are in good agreement with simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2004.837154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29740","startPage":"2513","endPage":"2520","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/29740/01353534.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2004.837154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniaturized fractal rat-race, branch-line, and coupled-line hybrids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fractals","Coupling circuits","Impedance matching","Electric variables","Circuit simulation","Circuit topology","Frequency","Geometry","Electromagnetic measurements","Integrated circuit measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","fractals","coupled transmission lines","microwave integrated circuits","circuit simulation","method of moments","waveguide couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled-line hybrids","branch-line hybrid","fractal rat race hybrid","space filling curves","miniaturized hybrids","electrical characteristics","second iteration Moore rat race coupler","second iteration Sierpinski branch-line coupler","nine section Minkowski coupled-line balun","compression ratio","associated coupling","space filling hybrids","moment method based full-wave electromagnetic simulator","fabricated coupler prototype"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Baluns","branch-line coupler","coupled-line baluns","fractal shapes","hybrids","rat-race coupler","space-filling curves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Miniaturized fractal rat-race, branch-line, and coupled-line hybrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1353534/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8216910","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniaturized fractal rat-race, branch-line, and coupled-line hybrids","sourcePdf":"01353534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045673S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"29740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"29740","articleId":"1353534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1353539,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Previously, Q's greater than 3000 and tolerances of /spl sim/0.19% have been achieved for embedded resonators. In this paper, more applications are demonstrated. Particular examples include the integration of a nonplanar monopole antenna coupled to a high-Q embedded cavity with only 0.26% shift in resonant frequency (19.37 GHz) and a slight 0.06% reduction in bandwidth compared to simulation. Stacked cavities and coupling sections within a substrate are also demonstrated to create vertically integrated filters. For 2% bandwidth two-pole filters, insertion losses as small as 0.27 dB are measured. Furthermore, a vertically integrated 1.2% four-pole filter is demonstrated with acceptable performance without tuning after fabrication. These applications illustrate that the laser-based stereolithography process is suitable for the integration of high-frequency and high-Q 3-D structures within a package.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2004.837165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/29740/01353541.pdf","startPage":"2567","endPage":"2575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2004.837165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of layer-by-layer polymer stereolithography for three-dimensional high-frequency components","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1353541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353541/","displayDocTitle":"Applications of layer-by-layer polymer stereolithography for three-dimensional high-frequency components","volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8216917","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353541/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of layer-by-layer polymer stereolithography for three-dimensional high-frequency components","sourcePdf":"01353541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048915S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"29740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"29740","articleId":"1353541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1353542,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

The phase noise of the free-running oscillator using the active resonator is -114.36 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset, which is 14 dB lower than the phase noise of the passive resonator oscillator. In the case of a VCO using the active resonator, the phase-noise performance is below -110 dBc/Hz over the whole tuning range, which is lower 13 dB compared to the passive resonator VCO.

In the fixed satellite service, the frequency bandwidths required to carry such data rates are available only at frequency bands such as Ka-band (20-30 GHz), V-band (40-50 GHz) or EHF-band (20-45 GHz). A problem with these frequency bands is the influence of the atmosphere on radiowave propagation. As the operating frequency is increased, attenuation and scintillation effects of atmospheric gases, clouds, rain and the melting layer become more severe. To evaluate the behaviour and quality of service of communications systems, the impact of the propagation channel has to be taken into account. The conventional approach, which consists in predicting only the attenuation distribution with respect to time, is not sufficient and finer information about the propagation channel dynamics is needed. We present the description of a time series generator relying on N-state Markov chains. With such a model, it is possible to synthesise, on demand, events that are characterised by a given depth and a given duration. Another key point of such an approach is the fact that it can be applied anywhere because the process relies on information provided by world-wide radio-meteorological maps and propagation prediction models, especially from the new ITU-R recommendation on fade dynamics. A preliminary validation of the Markov chains has been carried out to check the convergence of the stochastic process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","accessionNumber":"7665036","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel modelling based on N-state Markov chains for satcom systems simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel modelling based on N-state Markov chains for satcom systems simulation","confLoc":"Exeter, UK","sourcePdf":"01353590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031662S","chronDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","isNumber":"29705","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9352","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1353590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1353603,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

The measure of the severity is the magnitude of the complex correlation coefficient and the scenarios considered include, line-of-sight (LOS), and obstructed cases. It is found that significant changes in correlation levels can occur when the path alternates between non-LOS and LOS. The availability of LOS to the transmitting antenna resulted in a higher level of correlation.

The implementation of the DGF method does not require an absorbing boundary condition (ABC) because it can determine the field at any point, at any time step, directly from the current without computing the free space nodes in between. This makes it an ideal choice for application as an ABC for the FDTD grid. The DGF-FDTD method and Yee algorithm (see Yee, K.S., IEEE Trans. Antenna and Propag., vol.14, p.302, 1966) follow the same discrete scheme; they are two different exact solutions for the same problem and can be combined without any interfacing problems or numerical errors. The performance of the application of the DGF-FDTD method applied as an ABC is investigated, firstly using a simple point source located at the centre of the FDTD grid and secondly by its application to the modelling of a 2D waveguide. Evidence is given that the DGF-FDTD performance is comparable in accuracy to that obtained using PML, but has the advantage of being faster and less memory intensive.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20030072","publicationTitle":"Twelfth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation, 2003 (ICAP 2003).

The formulation of the DGF-FDTD is explained in some depth. The comparison of required storage between the two simulation techniques is conducted using a worked example; this shows that DGF-FDTD offers a significant reduction of demand, the FDTD requirement being 366.2 Mbytes as opposed to less than 1 Mbyte for DGF-FDTD. The DGF-FDTD, while it requires considerably less storage, does have some computational overheads, in particular for the calculation of the Green's functions. Using the fact that the Green's function from A to B is the same as its reciprocal reduces the number of Green's functions to be calculated. An anticipated use of the DGF-FDTD technique is one in which the advantages of the FDTD method are employed to the best advantage, that is to model a complex source, while the homogeneous area between the source and the target is modelled using DGF-FDTD.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the DGF-FDTD technique to log periodic antennas","publicationTitle":"Twelfth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation, 2003 (ICAP 2003).

The quality of service parameters for both indoor and outdoor propagation must be characterized for planning of the number of transmitters and repeaters required to provide minimum acceptable service. Preliminary results of the spatial variation of DVB-T signals received inside an apartment are presented. These are the first experimental results in Singapore and are of interest for future fixed DTV measurements. Measurements made along a line for about 20 wavelengths were analyzed taking different spatial intervals. A running mean technique with different window widths was studied to filter out the fast spatial variations. It is found that, a running mean of one wave length is suitable for averaging. Further, it is observed that the number of samples and spatial intervals are very important in order to arrive at the percentage of coverage. Though the difference observed in the standard deviation is small, it matters very much at higher percentages of probability. A uniform approach must be adopted to allow for a meaningful comparison for measuring and processing the signals for DTV reception.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20030145","publicationTitle":"Twelfth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation, 2003 (ICAP 2003).

To meet the constantly increasing capacity demands, the operating frequency is moving towards higher frequency bands (e.g. millimetre waveband). As overall signal attenuation is a result of signal interaction with different types of obstacles, more than one model is needed to predict attenuation with high accuracy. Moreover, because some obstacles are not static in a real environment, dynamic effects (especially in the millimetre waveband) have to be considered. The paper investigates the modelling of dynamic vegetation effects on the received signal level for broadband radio access networks. A new 3D lattice model is introduced. Based on measurements, it is confirmed that it has enough flexibility to model accurately the temporal as well as spatial-temporal dynamic effects of a tree blocking a receiver. More laboratory experiments and field tests with different types of trees need to be performed in order to optimize the model and to evaluate the necessary power margins with respect to quality of service requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","accessionNumber":"7671983","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","displayDocTitle":"Time-series prediction of attenuation caused by trees for fixed wireless access systems operating in millimeter waveband","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-series prediction of attenuation caused by trees for fixed wireless access systems operating in millimeter waveband","confLoc":"Exeter, UK","sourcePdf":"01353727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039455S","chronDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","isNumber":"29706","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9352","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1353727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1353728,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

Strong wind speed dependency of the RF signal was found as wind speed increased from low to medium speed. However the signal behaviour did not vary significantly from medium to high wind speeds. At 0.9 GHz, the fade statistics were not greatly dependent on wind speed. The crosspolarised configuration of the receiver was less affected by vegetation during low wind speed than the co-polarised configuration. Finally, it was concluded that RF propagation transmission through vegetation is strongly dependent on wind speed characteristics, frequency and to an extent on polarisation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2004","accessionNumber":"7665250","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and analysis of temporal fading due to moving vegetation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and analysis of temporal fading due to moving vegetation","confLoc":"Exeter, UK","sourcePdf":"01353728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024611S","chronDate":"31 March-3 April 2003","isNumber":"29706","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9352","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1353728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1353773,"authors":[{"name":"Cs.

The accuracy and efficiency of the system depend upon the situation where the system is to be used.","doi":"10.1109/ETECH.2004.1353842","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","displayPublicationTitle":"E-Tech 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9365/29744/01353842.pdf","publicationTitle":"E-Tech 2004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETECH.2004.1353842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition: a review and comparison of HMM, PCA, ICA and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Hidden Markov models","Principal component analysis","Independent component analysis","Neural networks","Face detection","Discrete cosine transforms","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Probability distribution","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","independent component analysis","principal component analysis","feature extraction","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","HMM","PCA","ICA","neural networks","review-based comparison","principal component analysis","preprocessing step","data dimensions reduction","hidden Markov models","embedded hidden Markov models","independent component analysis","system accuracy","system efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition: a review and comparison of HMM, PCA, ICA and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353842/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","conferenceDate":"31-31 July 2004","accessionNumber":"8162148","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition: a review and comparison of HMM, PCA, ICA and neural networks","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"01353842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070195S","chronDate":"31 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9365","isNumber":"29744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9365","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"29744","articleId":"1353842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1353844,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper proposes a Mechanism for Intelligent Neural network based Driving system (MIND), an advanced automated transport system with considerable advantages over previous attempts in this field. The system uses a multilayer feedforward neural network with backpropagation learning. In addition, the design of MIND involves the convergence of a plethora of technologies like the Global Positioning System (GPS), a geographic information system (GIS), and laser ranging. MIND can guide a mobile agent through a hostile and unfamiliar domain after being trained by a human user with domain expertise. One of the many areas in which MIND scores against the competition is that the system is completely domain independent and incurs a lot less processor overhead. MIND thus provides more functionality even though it requires a lot less input as compared to other attempts in this field This reduction in the size of the input vector translates into more efficient and faster processing. Another of MIND's hallmark features is its ability to negotiate turns and implement lane-changing maneuvers with a view to overtaking obstacles. It does this by employing a novel technique, selective net masking. A simulation of MIND's neural network was performed on a variety of network topologies, and the best network selected.","doi":"10.1109/ETECH.2004.1353844","startPage":"53","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"E-Tech 2004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETECH.2004.1353844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29744","displayPublicationTitle":"E-Tech 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9365/29744/01353844.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanism for an Intelligent Neural network based Driving system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1353844/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mechanism for an Intelligent Neural network based Driving system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1353844/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8162150","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","conferenceDate":"31-31 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanism for an Intelligent Neural network based Driving system","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"01353844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039045S","chronDate":"31 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9365","isNumber":"29744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9365","xplore-issue":"29744","articleId":"1353844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1353848,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Ismail","affiliation":["NED University of Engineering & Technology, Karachi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Ismail","id":"37276744600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8655-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1353848","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Electronics packaging","Master-slave","Concurrent computing","Power engineering computing","Genetic engineering","Evolution (biology)","Genetic mutations","Parallel processing","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","parallel algorithms","application program interfaces","search problems","operating systems (computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel genetic algorithms","PGA","master slave paradigm approach","search techniques","computation load","memory demand","scalability","heterogeneous computer networks","parallel mainframes","MPI library","Beowulf Linux Cluster"]}],"abstract":"Genetic algorithms (GAs) are powerful search techniques that are used to solve difficult problems in many disciplines.

Although MC-CDMA is not in standard, this paper proposes that it is a potential candidate for standardization because MC-CDMA may provide certain qualities that the other system may not support. UWB system operates in the indoor wireless environment wherein channel suffers from frequency-selective fading. Accordingly, DS-CDMA must use many rake fingers that increase system complexity. Further, it uses MBOK to raise data rate, but it has not shown good performance, based on the results of simulations shown in this paper. OFDM system is relatively simple as compared with the DS-CDMA, but it is not able to resolve a power problem; in other words, power is generated in excess of the standard as provided by the FCC regulations. Because MC-CDMA does not require RAKE receiver, it is simpler than DS-CDMA and it shows better performance than OFDM at low signal power. The BER performance of each system in downlink channel with S-V channel is compared by computer simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

For the real images, we propose a segmentation method to deal with the initial similarity map. The final similarity map is established by taking logical AND calculation of different color feature similarities so as to make full use of the color information. Experimental results have shown that the quality of the stereo matching can be considerably improved by using appropriate color matching algorithm comparing with the conventional gray value algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1353935","startPage":"I","endPage":"213","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

The resulting technique is particularly suitable for the optimization of the noise transfer function for /spl Sigma/-/spl Delta/ D/A converters. This is due to the fact that the classical IIR digital filter transfer function approximation techniques lead to the formation of delay-free loops in the D/A converter configuration proper. The usefulness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through its application to the design of a set of two 6-th order lowpass /spl Sigma/-/spl Delta/ D/A converters employing 64-times oversampling ratios for a final realization incorporating 8-bit multiplier coefficients.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1353999","startPage":"I","endPage":"349","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

This means two-layer CNNs have a much higher potential for signal processing than single-layer CNNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8380848","htmlLink":"/document/1354008/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On stable patterns realized by a class of one-dimensional two-layer CNNs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On stable patterns realized by a class of one-dimensional two-layer CNNs","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"01354008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095341S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9366","isNumber":"29746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9366","xplore-issue":"29746","articleId":"1354008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1354009,"authors":[{"name":"H.

While the parasitic capacitances are obtained using standard rule-based techniques, parasitic resistances and inductances are computed using a fast, yet accurate quasi-static inductance extraction method. Both self and mutual inductances and resistances of inductors and interconnects, which play a significant role at high frequencies, are accounted in the process. A simulated-annealing based optimization algorithm controls design space exploration. Synthesis results show that the proposed methodology yields designs that are more realistic and accurate compared to approaches that ignore resistive and inductive parasitics of interconnects.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29746","startPage":"I","endPage":"477","pdfPath":"/iel5/9366/29746/01354031.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

Even in the current technology, dramatic increase of leakage power at elevated temperature is a big problem. Burn-in testing, which is typically performed at 125/spl deg/C, is facing at difficulties such as throughput degradation of testing due to increase of leakage power. Reducing leakage power at operation time is essential to solve these problems. We propose a novel technique to reduce active leakage power of finite-state-machines (FSM's) at run time. Combinational logic gates are dynamically disconnected from the ground to reduce leakage when state transitions do not occur. Simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme reduces active leakage power by 30-60% in 0.18 /spl mu/m technology. The total power was reduced by 20% at the maximum at 125/spl deg/C. It was also found that performance degradation was tolerable for burn-in testing.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

DTGAL, has no non-adiabatic energy loss on output loads by using feedback control from next-stage buffer outputs. The minimization of energy consumption was investigated by choosing the optimal size of DTGAL circuits. A 64/spl times/64-b adiabatic SRAM is designed. The proposed DTGAL circuits are used to recover the charge of large switching capacitance on bit-lines, word-lines, and address decoders in fully adiabatic manner. The power consumption of the proposed SRAM is significantly reduced as the energy transferred to large capacitance buses is mostly recovered. Energy and functional simulations were performed using the net-list extracted from the layout. HSPICE simulation results indicate that the proposed SRAM attains energy savings of 65% to 90% as compared with the conventional CMOS implementation for clock rates ranging from 25 to 200 MHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power dual transmission gate adiabatic logic circuits and design of SRAM","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354053","startPage":"I","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29746","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

Since input data in the XDSL are symmetric, the computation of the IFFT can be reduced to multiplication accumulation operations in the real part. Furthermore, consideration is taken to process all multiplication operations together to lower hardware complexity. By separating all multiplication and accumulation operations into two groups, only an interface is needed to be the bridge between the two. The coefficients of the IFFT are represented by the canonic signed digits (CSDs) so that their shared terms are derived to reduce the number of adders for accomplishing multiplication operations. By using multiplexors to do the interface, the computation results from the multiplication part are distributed to their corresponding accumulators according to a time sequence. In addition, the size of the word length can be adequately selected to match the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As compared to the conventional IFFT architectures, the proposed IFFT architecture can have the least hardware complexity at the same throughput rate and SNR performance.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354107","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

One of most powerful approaches to decode the code is called parallel decision-feedback decoding. However, VLSI implementation of a PDFD (parallel decision-feedback decoder) operating at 833 MHz is extremely challenging due to its long critical path. This paper extends the word-level parallel processing technique for Viterbi decoders to design high speed parallel PDFDs. Compared with the straight-forward implementation of PDFDs, a 2-level parallel PDFD can achieve a speedup of 1.5 while the speedup for a 3-level parallel PDFD is around 2. More speedup is achievable if we combine some other techniques, such as pre-computation technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354134/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8153193","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parallel design for parallel decision feedback decoders for 10GBASE-T","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel design for parallel decision feedback decoders for 10GBASE-T","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"01354134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069637S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9366","isNumber":"29747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9366","xplore-issue":"29747","articleId":"1354134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1354135,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

High demands with respect to recognition speed and certainty have to be satisfied by means of low-cost hardware implementations. Especially realization of such algorithms for extraction of regional information, e.g. for shape recognition, is thus a challenging task. The latter is addressed by investigating the implementability of binary morphological operations with large operator masks. The design procedure for implementation in low-cost FPGAs as well as a relatively accurate estimation of the required hardware effort is presented. Programmable operator mask sizes of up to 31 /spl times/ 31 pixels and a high data throughput of several giga-pixels per second can be obtained by the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

The other module performs the function of the current loop control for PMSM drives, which includes vector control, SVPWM generation, coordinate transformation, PI controller and the pulse detection of the quadrature encoder. The former is implemented by software using Nios embedded processor due to the need of complicated control algorithm and low sampling frequency control (motion trajectory control & position control: less than 1kHz). The latter is implemented by hardware due to the need of high sampling frequency control (current loop: 16 kHz, PWM circuit: 4/spl sim/8 MHz) but simple computation.

However, ultrasonic sensors have the severe drawbacks of low resolution and inherent weakness in the form of external noise. In order to improve the performance of the shape recognition with ultrasonic sensors, we here proposed a shape recognition system by network configuration of ultrasonic sensor array and CCD image sensors. The sensor network system allows application in situations in which it is difficult to identify an object's shape using ultrasonic sensor array alone or CCD image sensor alone. The basic concept of the approach is to fuse the shape recognition information, which is acquired using the sensor network, by Genetic algorithms (GAs).","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354207","pdfPath":"/iel5/9366/29747/01354207.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

The OFDM has several advantages, i.e., the possibility of a simple equalization of the received signal. However, the disadvantages are also considered as the phase ambiguity due to intercarrier-interference (ICI) which causes the significant degradation on the performance of an OFDM system. The proposed method is a radial basis function (RBF) neural network which learns the characteristic of M-QAM signal constellation before reconstructing the correct signal constellation under noisy circumstances. The hybrid learning process is used to train the RBF network. The hidden layer is trained by the hard c means clustering. The supervised learning with given input-output pairs are used to train the output layer. This paper assumes an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The simulation results of the random symbol generations show that the probability of errors closes to ideal with the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354225","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

Although the BSS algorithm can successfully separate different user signals at FB level, the permutation indeterminacy nature of BSS algorithm hinder the signal recomposition from the separated signals. A method taking advantage of the statistic characteristics of the transmitted signals is proposed to overcome these obstacles.

Base on the structure of STMC, the proposed equalizer provides ISI-free communications over the ISI MIMO channels without a long guard period. The GSIC-ZFE is based on linear FIR zero-forcing equalizer (FIR-ZFE) and the successive interference cancellation (SIC). In each iteration, a group of elements in the source signal vector are detected and canceled. The performance of FIR-ZFE designed in each iteration can therefore be enhanced. At the same time, the error propagation problem associated with SIC is reduced by limiting the cancellation process to be independent in each time slot. We further considered the SIC operated in a group-by-group basis to reduce the computational complexity of the GSIC-ZFE. Simulation results presented in the paper has shown substantial gain can be obtained by GSIC-ZFE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8153292","htmlLink":"/document/1354243/","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Zero-forcing equalizer with group successive interference cancellation for space-time modulated codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-forcing equalizer with group successive interference cancellation for space-time modulated codes","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"01354243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06004S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9366","isNumber":"29747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9366","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29747","articleId":"1354243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1354244,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, China"],"lastName":"Chen Liu","id":"37087157009"},{"name":"Zhenyang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, China"],"lastName":"Zhenyang Wu","id":"37087437259"},{"name":"Wu Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Information Engineering, Shanghai JiaoTong University, China"],"lastName":"Wu Zheng","id":"37087531308"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8346-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1354244","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"abstract":"ln this paper, we present a new sphere decoder for space-time block code (STBC) decoding.

For space-time block code(STBC) transmitted over time-selective slowly fading channels, a novel Kalman filter-based channel estimation method, based on the incorporation of the quasi-ML symbol decoding mechanism will be developed throughout this paper, complete with computer simulations to see the influence of various parameters like the fading rate, SNR and pilot symbol placement on the BER performance. Evaluation of the results reveals that Kalman filtering, coupled with adequate pilot symbol placement, provides an optimum BER performance with little loss in channel capacity.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29747","startPage":"II","endPage":"II","pdfPath":"/iel5/9366/29747/01354247.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

The presented technique is based on only few continuous wave (CW) measurements selected in relation to a statistical analysis of the dynamic input power. A complex power series model, extracted from these measurements, is used to predict ACPR. Using a CDMA2000 test signal, the amplifier ACPR estimated with this method is in good agreement with direct spectrum measurement. Consequently, the proposed method allows an accurate and complete amplifier distortion characterization, which is less expensive and less time consuming than dynamic characterization or complete CW measurements.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354276","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

Adaptive digital predistortion (ADP) is one promising linearization technique that can be employed. This paper presents a combined neural network and fuzzy systems based ADP for RF PA linearization. This hybrid approach employed is called adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). It has advantages of real-time processing of PA signals, offline adaptation, good IMD suppression, no convergence problems and flexible tuning capability. Experimental results show that a distorted WCDMA signal has been improved by around 12 dB, with noise floor well below -60 dBm. The adaptability of this ANFIS approach to instantaneous variation in PA response through time is also demonstrated, and results show that this ANFIS approach is capable of adapting to simulated environmental changes. Further testing also demonstrated that the tuning parameters involved in the training could be reduced by more than half for a fairly nonlinear PA without significantly degrading the distortion suppression capability, thus a tremendous amount of DSP processing burden can be saved.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354291","startPage":"iii","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

Self-generating neural networks (SGNN) are one of the suitable base-classifiers for MCS because of their simple setting and fast learning. However, the computation cost of the MCS increases in proportion to the number of SGNN. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for the structure of the SGNN in the MCS. Experiments have been conducted to compare the pruned MCS with an unpruned MCS, the MCS based on C4.5, and k-nearest neighbor method. The results show that the pruned MCS can improve its classification accuracy as well as reducing the computation cost.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354297","startPage":"iii","endPage":"85","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

An NMR FID signal in the Gabor transform domain (i.e., a joint time-frequency domain) is concentrated in a few number of Gabor transform coefficients while the noise is fairly distributed among all the coefficients. Therefore, the NMR FID signals can be significantly enhanced by performing a thresholding technique on the coefficients in the transform domain. Theoretical and experimental analyses in this paper show that the oversampled Gabor transform using the Gaussian synthesis window is more suitable for the NMR FID signal enhancement than the critically-sampled one using exponential synthesis window, because both the Gaussian synthesis window and its corresponding analysis window in the oversampling case can have better localization in the frequency domain than the exponential synthesis window and its corresponding analysis window in the critically-sampled case. Moreover, to speed up the transform, instead of the common used complex-valued discrete Gabor transform, the real-valued discrete Gabor transform proposed in our previous work is adopted in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354322","startPage":"iii","endPage":"183","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

This is accomplished by a simplification of predictor coefficient algorithm, which normally requires a high complexity correlation algorithm, while the sound quality measured as SNR remains relatively the same to those of the original ADPCM. The less complicated calculation results in a reduction of the chip area and power consumption, thus it is suitable for pocket solid-state speech and audio recorder. Simulations on MATLAB verify the performances and experimental results on XILINX FPGA synthesis confirming the functionalities and significant reduction of device count by 63% of the implementation by the original algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354323","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

High-speed applications of RSA systems require parallel implementations of modular multipliers. Besides using the systolic architecture which is popular in hardware-based RSA systems, a block-based scheme is used to further eliminate global signals, with a pipelined bus to convey data globally. The control signals and intermediate results used for sequential multiplications are transmitted by shift registers. All signals, except for the clock signal, are limited in one block or between two adjacent blocks. A carry-save-adder structure is used for calculating the iterative step of the algorithm, which contributes to speed improvement and area saving. In addition, long modular multipliers suffer from the effect of large fanout. Novel architectures are proposed to eliminate the fanout bottleneck, which reduce the achievable minimum clock period of long modular multipliers. Compared to the original modular multiplier architecture with fanout bottleneck, the proposed architectures can achieve an increase of over 7% in throughput without increase in area. The Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) technique increases the decryption data rate by a factor of four. Two redundant blocks are added to adapt to the on-line partition of the multiplier and the variation of the length of P and Q in CRT mode.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2004.1354396","publicationTitle":"The 2004 47th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

We argue that the current consensus of using Ethernet spanning tree and a SONET 1+1 protection, while providing reliability, is an inefficient use of resources. Instead, we claim that EoS opens novel opportunities for protection heretofore unavailable in other environments. In particular, the deployment of virtual concatenation and LCAS protocols enables \"route splitting\", creating a fundamentally new routing paradigm for circuit-switched environments. We propose a scheme called PESO, appropriate for EoS, with innovative routing, failure notification and switching components. More importantly, it is competitive with SONET protection without its 100% bandwidth overhead. We also suggest a enhancement in LCAS that can further improve PESO'S switching time. PESO leverages the underlying protocols, making it extremely attractive to implement and use in practice.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354491","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29751/01354491.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29751","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PESO: low overhead protection for Ethernet over SONET transport","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PESO: low overhead protection for Ethernet over SONET transport","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354491/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8369652","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354491/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PESO: low overhead protection for Ethernet over SONET transport","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140237S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"29751","articleId":"1354491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1354496,"authors":[{"name":"C.-F.

A widely employed energy-saving technique is to place nodes in sleep mode, corresponding to a low-power consumption as well as to reduced operational capabilities. In this work, we develop a Markov model of a sensor network whose nodes may enter a sleep mode, and we use this model to investigate the system performance in terms of energy consumption, network capacity, and data deliver delay. Furthermore, the proposed model enables us to investigate the trade-offs existing between these performance metrics and the sensor dynamics in sleep/active mode.

The focus is to explore the energy-latency tradeoffs in wireless communication using techniques such as modulation scaling. The data aggregation tree - a multiple-source single-sink communication paradigm - is employed for abstracting the packet flow. We consider a real-time scenario where the data gathering must be performed within a specified latency constraint. We present algorithms to minimize the overall energy dissipation of the sensor nodes in the aggregation tree subject to the latency constraint. For the off-line problem, we propose (a) a numerical algorithm for the optimal solution, and (h) a pseudo-polynomial time approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming. We also discuss techniques for handling interference among the sensor nodes. Simulations have been conducted for both long-range communication and short-range communication. The simulation results show that compared with the classic shutdown technique, between 20% to 90% energy savings can be achieved by our techniques, under different settings of several key system parameters. We also develop an on-line distributed protocol that relies only on the local information available at each sensor node within the aggregation tree. Simulation results show that between 15% to 90% energy conservation can be achieved by the on-line protocol. The adaptability of the protocol with respect to variations in the packet size and latency constraint is also demonstrated through several run-time scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354498","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29751/01354498.pdf","endPage":"255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-latency tradeoffs for data gathering in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354498/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-latency tradeoffs for data gathering in wireless sensor networks","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8410761","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1354498/","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-latency tradeoffs for data gathering in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132622S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"29751","articleId":"1354498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1354499,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Consider n identical randomly located nodes, on a unit area, forming an ad-hoc wireless network. Assuming a fixed per node transmission capability of T hits per second at a fixed range, it has been shown that the uniform throughput capacity per node r(n) is /spl otimes/(T//spl radic/nlogn). We consider an alternate communication model, with each node constrained to a maximum transmit power P/sub 0/ and capable of utilizing W Hz of bandwidth. Under the limiting case W/spl rarr//spl infin/, such as in ultra wide band networks, the uniform throughput per node is /spl otimes/((nlogn)/sup /spl alpha/-1/2/ (upper bound) and /spl Omega/(n/sup (/spl alpha/-1)/2//(logn)/sup (/spl alpha/+1)/2/) (achievable lower bound). These bounds demonstrate that throughput increases with node density n, in contrast to previously published results.

Grossglauser and Tse (2001) showed that when nodes are mobile it is possible to have a constant or /spl otimes/(1) throughput scaling per source-destination pair. The focus of this paper is on characterizing the delay and determining the throughput-delay trade-off in such fixed and mobile ad hoc networks. For the Gupta-Kumar fixed network model, we show that the optimal throughput-delay trade-off is given by D(n) = /spl otimes/(nT(n)), where T(n) and D(n) are the throughput and delay respectively. For the Grossglauser-Tse mobile network model, we show that the delay scales as /spl otimes/(n/sup 1/2//v(n)), where v(n) is the velocity of the mobile nodes. We then describe a scheme that achieves the optimal order of delay for any given throughput. The scheme varies (i) the number of hops, (ii) the transmission range and (iii) the degree of node mobility to achieve the optimal throughput-delay trade-off. The scheme produces a range of models that capture the Gupta-Kumar model at one extreme and the Grossglauser-Tse model at the other. In the course of our work, we recover previous results of Gupta and Kumar, and Grossglauser and Tse using simpler techniques, which might be of a separate interest.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354518","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29751/01354518.pdf","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-delay trade-off in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354518/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-delay trade-off in wireless networks","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8410767","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1354518/","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-delay trade-off in wireless networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063963S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"294","xplore-issue":"29751","articleId":"1354518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1354519,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In most previous studies on optical mesh networks, traffic demands are usually assumed to be wavelength demands, in which case no traffic grooming is needed. In practice, optical networks are typically required to carry a large number of lower rate (sub-wavelength) traffic demands. Hence, the issue of traffic grooming becomes very important since it can significantly impact the overall network cost. In our study, we consider traffic grooming in combination with traffic routing and wavelength assignment. Our objective is to minimize the total number of transponders required in the network. We first formulate the GRWA problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Unfortunately, for large networks it is computationally infeasible to solve the ILP problem. Therefore, we propose a decomposition method that divides the GRWA problem into two smaller problems: the traffic grooming and routing problem and the wavelength assignment problem, which can then be solved much more efficiently. In general, the decomposition method only produces an approximate solution for the GRWA problem. However, we also provide some sufficient condition under which the decomposition method gives an optimal solution. Finally, some numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354521/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8369670","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Traffic grooming, routing, and wavelength assignment in optical WDM mesh networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic grooming, routing, and wavelength assignment in optical WDM mesh networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"01354521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058234S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"29751","articleId":"1354521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1354528,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"lastName":"Qun Li","id":"37277888300"},{"name":"D.

Keys for encryption purposes must he agreed upon by communicating nodes. Due to resource constraints, achieving such key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks. Pre-distribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory used when the network size is large. Recently, a random key pre-distribution scheme and its improvements have been proposed. A common assumption made by these random key pre-distribution schemes is that no deployment knowledge is available. Noticing that in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available a priori, we propose a novel random key pre-distribution scheme that exploits deployment knowledge and avoids unnecessary key assignments. We show that the performance (including connectivity, memory usage, and network resilience against node capture) of sensor networks can he substantially improved with the use of our proposed scheme.

We first focus on a network of n immobile nodes, each with a destination node chosen in random. We develop a scheme under which, in the absence of fading, the network can provide each node with a traffic rate /spl lambda//sub 1/(n)=K/sub 1/(nlog n)/sup -1/ 2/. This result was first shown in J. Hightower and G. Borriello (2001) under a similar setting, however the proof presented here is shorter and uses only basic probability tools. We then proceed to show that, under a general model of fading, each node can send data to its destination with a rate /spl lambda//sub 2/(n)=K/sub 2/n/sup -1// /sup 2/(log n)/sup -3/2/. Next, we extend our formulation to study the effects of node mobility. We first develop a simple scheme under which each of the a mobile nodes can send data to a randomly chosen destination node with a rate /spl lambda//sub 3/(n)=K/sub 3/n/sup -1/2/(log n)/sup -3/2/, and with a fixed upper bound on the packet delay d/sub max/ that does not depend on n. We subsequently develop a scheme under which each of the nodes can send data to its destination with a rate /spl lambda//sub 4/(n)=K/sub 4/n/sup (d-1)/ 2/(log n)/sup -5/ 2 /provided that nodes are willing to tolerate packet delays smaller than d/sub max/(n)<K/sub 5/n/sup d/, where 0<d<1. With both schemes, a general model of fading is assumed. In addition, nodes require no global topology or routing information, and only need to coordinate locally. The above results hold for an appropriate choice of values for the constants K/sub i/, and with probability approaching 1 as the number of nodes n approaches infinity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29751/01354532.pdf","endPage":"619","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large wireless networks under fading, mobility, and delay constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Fading","H infinity control","Mobile ad hoc networks","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Upper bound","Delay effects","Network topology","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","fading channels","probability","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless ad hoc network","probability tool","fading","immobile nodes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Large wireless networks under fading, mobility, and delay constraints","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1354532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8410775","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large wireless networks under fading, mobility, and delay constraints","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065293S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"29751","articleId":"1354532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1354534,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique for achieving these goals. In this work, we propose a new energy-efficient approach for clustering nodes in ad-hoc sensor networks. Based on this approach, we present a protocol, HEED (hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of their residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED does not make any assumptions about the distribution or density of nodes, or about node capabilities, e.g., location-awareness. The clustering process terminates in O(1) iterations, and does not depend on the network topology or size. The protocol incurs low overhead in terms of processing cycles and messages exchanged. It also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. A careful selection of the secondary clustering parameter can balance load among cluster heads. Our simulation results demonstrate that HEED outperforms weight-based clustering protocols in terms of several cluster characteristics. We also apply our approach to a simple application to demonstrate its effectiveness in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting data aggregation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed clustering in ad-hoc sensor networks: a hybrid, energy-efficient approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29751/01354534.pdf","endPage":"640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Distributed clustering in ad-hoc sensor networks: a hybrid, energy-efficient approach","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1354534/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8410776","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed clustering in ad-hoc sensor networks: a hybrid, energy-efficient approach","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08616S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"453","xplore-issue":"29751","articleId":"1354534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1354536,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We introduce the idea of a deltoid: an item that has a large difference, whether the difference is absolute, relative or variational. We present novel algorithms for finding the most significant deltoids in high speed traffic data, and prove that they use small space, very small time per update, and are guaranteed to find significant deltoids with prespecified accuracy.

However, since that original data set was collected, both link speeds and the number of Internet-connected hosts have increased by more than three orders of magnitude. Thus, we now revisit the Poisson assumption, by studying a combination of historical traces and new measurements obtained from a major backbone link belonging to a Tier 1 ISP. We show that unlike the older data sets, current network traffic can be well represented by the Poisson model for sub-second time scales. At multisecond scales, we find a distinctive piecewise-linear nonstationarity, together with evidence of long-range dependence. Combining our observations across both time scales leads to a time-dependent Poisson characterization of network traffic that, when viewed across very long time scales, exhibits the observed long-range dependence. This traffic characterization reconciliates the seemingly contradicting observations of Poisson and long-memory traffic characteristics.

Using multiple sources potentially provides a more accurate and refined characterization of the internal network. We present a novel multiple source active measurement procedure using a semirandomized probing scheme and packet arrival order measurements which do not require precise synchronization between the participating hosts. A decision-theoretic framework is developed enabling the joint characterization of topology and internal performance.

The base stations are equipped with antenna arrays and can transmit to more than one mobile user at any time instant, provided the users are spatially separable. In previous work, an infinite traffic demand model is used to study the physical layer beamforming and power control algorithms that maximize the system throughput. In this paper we consider finite user traffic demands. A scheduling policy makes a decision based on both the queue lengths and the spatial separability of the users. The objective of the scheduling algorithm is to maintain the stability of the system. We derive an optimal scheduling policy that maintains the stability of the system if it is stable under any scheduling policy. However, this optimal scheduling policy is exponentially complex in the number of users which renders it impractical. We propose four heuristic scheduling algorithms that have polynomial complexity. The first two algorithms are for the special case of single cell systems, while the other two algorithms deal with multiple cell systems. Using a realistic multipath wireless channel model, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through computer simulations.

The channel conditions between the basestation and the users are time-varying and user-dependent. We wish to define which user to schedule at each time step. Previous work on this problem has typically assumed that the channel conditions are governed by a stationary stochastic process. In this setting a popular algorithm known as Max-Weight has been shown to have good performance. However, the stationarity assumption is not always reasonable. In this paper we study a more general worst-case model in which the channel conditions are governed by an adversary and are not necessarily stationary. In this model, we show that the nonstationarities can cause Max-Weight to have extremely poor performance. In particular, even if the set of possible transmission rates is finite, as in the CDMA 1timesEV-DO system, Max-Weight can produce queues size that are exponential in the number of users. On the positive side, we describe a set of tracking algorithms that aim to track the performance of a schedule maintained by the adversary. For one of these tracking algorithms the queue sizes are only quadratic. We discuss a number of practical issues associated with the tracking algorithms. We also illustrate the performance of Max-Weight and the tracking algorithms using simulation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling over nonstationary wireless channels with finite rate sets","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29752/01354581.pdf","startPage":"1694","endPage":"1704 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling over nonstationary wireless channels with finite rate sets","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1354581/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8302727","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling over nonstationary wireless channels with finite rate sets","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084387S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"29752","articleId":"1354581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1354582,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Moreover, these protocols must be designed to prolong the battery lifetime of the nodes. Typical existing routing techniques for ad hoc networks are known not to scale well. On the other hand, the so-called geographical routing algorithms are known to be scalable but their energy efficiency has never been extensively and comparatively studied. For this reason, a novel analytical framework is introduced. In a geographical routing algorithm, the packets are forwarded by a node to its neighbor based on their respective positions. The proposed framework allows to analyze the relationship between the energy efficiency of the routing tasks and the extension of the range of the topology knowledge for each node. The leading forwarding rules for geographical routing are compared in this framework, and the energy efficiency of each of them is studied. Moreover partial topology knowledge forwarding, a new forwarding scheme, is introduced. A wider topology knowledge can improve the energy efficiency of the routing tasks but can increase the cost of topology information due to signaling packets that each node must transmit and receive to acquire this information, especially in networks with high mobility. The problem of determining the optimal knowledge range for each node to make energy efficient geographical routing decisions is tackled by integer linear programming. It is demonstrated that the problem is intrinsically localized, i.e., a limited knowledge of the topology is sufficient to take energy efficient forwarding decisions, and that the proposed forwarding scheme outperforms the others in typical application scenarios. For online solution of the problem, a probe-based distributed protocol which allows each node to efficiently select its topology knowledge, is introduced and shown to converge to a near-optimal solution very fast","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal local topology knowledge for energy efficient geographical routing in sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354582","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1716 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29752","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29752/01354582.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Optimal local topology knowledge for energy efficient geographical routing in sensor networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1354582/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8302728","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal local topology knowledge for energy efficient geographical routing in sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084269S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"29752","articleId":"1354582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1354583,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Previous methodologies are either based on random sampling (e.g., Cisco's NetFlow), which is inaccurate, or only account for the \"elephants\". We introduce a novel technique for measuring per-flow traffic approximately, for all flows regardless of their sizes, at very high-speed (say, OC768). The core of this technique is a novel data structure called space code bloom filter (SCBF). A SCBF is an approximate representation of a multiset; each element in this multiset is a traffic flow and its multiplicity is the number of packets in the flow. The multiplicity of an element in the multiset represented by SCBF can be estimated through either of two mechanisms-maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or mean value estimation (MVE). Through parameter tuning, SCBF allows for graceful tradeoff between measurement accuracy and computational and storage complexity. SCBF also contributes to the foundation of data streaming by introducing a new paradigm called blind streaming. We evaluate the performance of SCBF through mathematical analysis and through experiments on packet traces gathered from a tier-1 ISP backbone. Our results demonstrate that SCBF achieves reasonable measurement accuracy with very low storage and computational complexity","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354587","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29752/01354587.pdf","startPage":"1762","endPage":"1773 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-code bloom filter for efficient per-flow traffic measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354587/","displayDocTitle":"Space-code bloom filter for efficient per-flow traffic measurement","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8302733","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1354587/","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-code bloom filter for efficient per-flow traffic measurement","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062681S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"29752","articleId":"1354587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1354597,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the present paper, we examine how slower, mobility-induced rate variations impact performance at flow level, accounting for the random number of flows sharing the transmission resource.

Using stochastic comparison techniques, we show that these limit regimes provide simple performance bounds that only depend on easily calculated load factors. Additionally, we prove that for a broad class of fading processes, performance varies monotically with the speed of the rate variations.

There are several benefits of IP-based RAN including lower costs, flexibility of merging wired and wireless networks, and network scalability and reliability. While quality of service issues in IP-based RAN have been addressed by a number of researchers, the question of connectivity, i.e., how best to connect base stations to the radio network controllers (RNC) in an IP-based RAN, has not been addressed by any research literature. Furthermore, given a connection configuration, an RNC selection algorithm that assigns an incoming call to an RNC is also necessary. This paper examines radio access network (RAN) connectivity and its impact on the performance and resiliency of the wireless network using different RNC selection algorithms. The proposed min-load-1 algorithm, which allows at most one hard hand off in order to accommodate each incoming request, delivers performance close to the standard Min-Load algorithm using a RAN of much higher connectivity and is close to the optimal algorithm using the same RAN. We also find that using min-load-1 algorithm and allowing the base stations to connect to two RNCs result in resiliency to RNC failures that is similar to having full-mesh connectivity between base stations and RNCs","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354600","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29752/01354600.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29752","startPage":"1905","endPage":"1915 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectivity, performance, and resiliency of IP-based CDMA radio access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Connectivity, performance, and resiliency of IP-based CDMA radio access networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354600/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8302746","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354600/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectivity, performance, and resiliency of IP-based CDMA radio access networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055217S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"29752","articleId":"1354600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1354603,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Khojastepour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Khojastepour","id":"37275310400"},{"name":"A.

The main emphasis is on deriving robust schedulers which do not rely on the knowledge of the source arrival process. Towards that end, we first show that all schedulers (robust or otherwise) which guarantee a maximum queuing delay for each packet are equivalent to a time-varying linear filter. Using the connection between filtering and scheduling, we study the design of optimal power minimizing robust schedulers. Two cases, motivated by filtering connection, are studied in detail. First, a time-invariant robust scheduler is presented and its performance is completely characterized. Second, we present the optimal time-varying robust scheduler, and show that it has a very intuitive time water-filling structure.

In our multichip scheme, we devise a load-balanced TCAM table construction algorithm together with an adaptive load balancing mechanism. The power efficiency is well controlled by decreasing the number of TCAM entries triggered in each lookup operation.

This paper presents a novel method for QoS provisioning via the use of the average reward reinforcement learning, which can maximize the network revenue subject to several predetermined QoS constraints. By considering handoff dropping probability, average allocated bandwidth and intraclass fairness simultaneously, our algorithm formulation guarantees that these QoS parameters are kept within predetermined constraints. Unlike other model-based algorithms, our scheme does not require explicit state transition probabilities and therefore the assumptions behind the underlying system model are more realistic than those in previous schemes. Moreover, by considering the status of neighboring cells, the proposed scheme can dynamically adapt to changes in traffic condition.

Traditionally, cache designs trade off time and space with the goal of balancing the overall cost and performance of the device. We examine another axis of the design space that has not been previously considered: accuracy. In particular, we quantify the benefits of relaxing the accuracy of the cache on the cost and performance of packet classification caches. Our cache design is based on the popular Bloom filter data structure. This paper provides a model for optimizing Bloom filters for this purpose, as well as extensions to the data structure to support graceful aging, bounded misclassification rates, and multiple binary predicates. Given this, we show that such caches can provide nearly an order of magnitude cost savings at the expense of misclassifying one billionth of packets for IPv6-based caches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate caches for packet classification","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354643","endPage":"2207 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354643.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","startPage":"2196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354643","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Costs","Aging","Data structures","Cache storage","System software","Laboratories","Modems","Protocols","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","telecommunication network routing","IP networks","information filters","data structures","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet classification cache","Bloom filter data structure","multiple binary predicate","bounded misclassification rate","IPv6-based cache"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximate caches for packet classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354643/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8244035","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate caches for packet classification","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079322S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1354644,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Every node on the network is assigned an optical orthogonal codeword (OOC) to transmit or receive on. OOCs are designed to be pseudo-orthogonal, i.e., the correlation (and therefore the interference) between pairs of codewords is constrained. This paper demonstrates that the use of optical CDMA does not preclude the need for a media access control (MAC) layer protocol to resolve contention for the shared media. OOCs have low spectral efficiency. As more codewords are transmitted simultaneously, the interference between codewords increases and the network throughput falls. This paper analyzes a network architecture where there is virtually no MAC layer, except for choice of the codeset, and shows that its throughput degrades and collapses under moderate to heavy load. We propose an alternate architecture called interference avoidance where nodes on the network use media access mechanisms to avoid causing interference on the line, thereby improving network throughput. Interference avoidance is analyzed and it is shown that it can provide up to 30% improvement in throughput with low delays and no throughput collapse. We validate our analysis through simulation with realistic network traffic traces.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The need for media access control in optical CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354644.pdf","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2219 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"The need for media access control in optical CDMA networks","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354644/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244036","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The need for media access control in optical CDMA networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109052S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1354653,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To obtain accurate sensing data, many sensor nodes should he deployed and then the collaboration among them becomes an important issue. In W. Zhang and G. Cao, a tree-based approach has been proposed to facilitate sensor nodes collaborating in detecting and tracking a mobile target. As the target moves, many nodes in the tree may become faraway from the root of the tree, and hence a large amount of energy may be wasted for them to send their sensing data to the root. We address the tree reconfiguration problem. We formalize it as finding a min-cost convoy tree sequence, and solve it by proposing an optimized complete reconfiguration scheme and an optimized interception-based reconfiguration scheme. Analysis and simulation are conducted to compare the proposed schemes with each other and with other reconfiguration schemes. The results show that the proposed schemes are more energy efficient than others.","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354665.pdf","startPage":"2434","endPage":"2445 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing tree reconfiguration for mobile target tracking in sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing tree reconfiguration for mobile target tracking in sensor networks","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244057","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354665/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing tree reconfiguration for mobile target tracking in sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05763S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1354666,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Ye","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Fan Ye","id":"37418441400"},{"name":"Haiyun Luo","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Haiyun Luo","id":"37275771600"},{"name":"Songwu Lu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Songwu Lu","id":"37280072500"},{"name":"Lixia Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lixia Zhang","id":"37280169800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8355-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"1354666","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Large-scale systems","Data security","Batteries","Message authentication","Event detection","Filters","Decision making","Analytical models","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","message authentication","decision making","sensors","filtering theory","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical en-route filtering","injected false data","large-scale sensor network","message authentication code","collective decision-making"]}],"abstract":"In a large-scale sensor network individual sensors are subject to security compromises. A compromised node can inject into the network large quantities of bogus sensing reports which, if undetected, would be forwarded to the data collection point (i.e. the sink). Such attacks by compromised sensors can cause not only false alarms but also the depletion of the finite amount of energy in a battery powered network. We present a statistical en-route filtering (SEF) mechanism that can detect and drop such false reports. SEF requires that each sensing report be validated by multiple keyed message authentication codes (MACs), each generated by a node that detects the same event. As the report is forwarded, each node along the way verifies the correctness of the MACs probabilistically and drops those with invalid MACs at earliest points. The sink further filters out remaining false reports that escape the en-route filtering. SEF exploits the network scale to determine the truthfulness of each report through collective decision-making by multiple detecting nodes and collective false-report-detection by multiple forwarding nodes. Our analysis and simulations show that, with an overhead of 14 bytes per report, SEF is able to drop 80/spl sim/90% injected false reports by a compromised node within 10 forwarding hops, and reduce energy consumption by 50% or more in many cases.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354666","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354666.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","startPage":"2446","endPage":"2457 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical en-route filtering of injected false data in sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical en-route filtering of injected false data in sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354666/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244058","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354666/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical en-route filtering of injected false data in sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10192S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1354667,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Qing Fang","id":"37087717103"},{"name":"Jie Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jie Gao","id":"37087623847"},{"name":"L.J.

Simulation results show that our protocols can provide high coverage within a short deploying time and limited movement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354668.pdf","startPage":"2469","endPage":"2479 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Movement-assisted sensor deployment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Chemical sensors","Minimax techniques","Computer science","Wireless sensor networks","Scattering","Aircraft manufacture","Network servers","Robot sensing systems","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","protocols","computational geometry","mobile radio","minimax techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["movement-assisted sensor deployment","wireless sensor network","distributed self-deployment protocol","mobile sensor","coverage hole","Voronoi diagram","sensor deployment protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Movement-assisted sensor deployment","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244060","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Movement-assisted sensor deployment","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069641S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1354673,"authors":[{"name":"Mung Chiang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Mung Chiang","id":"37273230100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8355-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"1354673","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Physical layer","Spread spectrum communication","Power control","Robust stability","Couplings","Convergence","Mobile ad hoc networks","Interference","Robust control","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transport protocols","ad hoc networks","telecommunication congestion control","distributed control","power control","optimisation","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication channels","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transport layer","physical layer","wireless multihop network","wireless ad hoc network","multihop transmission","interference-limited link rate","congestion control","network performance","network architectural modularity","distributive power control algorithm","TCP protocol","end-to-end throughput","energy efficiency","nonlinearly constrained optimization","coupled system","router buffer occupancy information","path loss estimation error"]}],"abstract":"In a wireless ad hoc network with multihop transmissions and interference-limited link rates, can we balance power control in the physical layer and congestion control in the transport layer to enhance the overall network performance, while maintaining the stability, robustness, and architectural modularity of the network? We present a distributive power control algorithm that couples with the original TCP protocols to increase the end-to-end throughput and energy efficiency of the network. Under the rigorous framework of nonlinearly constrained optimization, we prove the convergence of this coupled system to the global optimum of joint power control and congestion control, for both synchronized and asynchronous implementations. The rate of convergence is geometric and a desirable modularity between the transport and physical layers is maintained. In particular, when the congestion control mechanism is TCP Vegas, that a simple utilization in the physical layer of the router buffer occupancy information suffices to achieve the joint optimum of this cross layer design. Both analytic results and simulations illustrate other desirable properties of the proposed algorithm, including robustness to channel outage and to path loss estimation errors, and flexibility in trading-off performance optimality for implementation simplicity.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354673","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","startPage":"2525","endPage":"2536 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To layer or not to layer: balancing transport and physical layers in wireless multihop networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"To layer or not to layer: balancing transport and physical layers in wireless multihop networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354673/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8221438","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To layer or not to layer: balancing transport and physical layers in wireless multihop networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085924S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1354674,"authors":[{"name":"Liangzhong Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Liangzhong Yin","id":"37274088000"},{"name":"Guohong Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Guohong Cao","id":"37273327300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8355-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"1354674","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cooperative caching","Intelligent networks","Ad hoc networks","Bandwidth","Delay","Computer science","Data engineering","Electronic mail","Performance analysis","Mobile ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","information retrieval","cache storage","queueing theory","communication complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative caching","ad hoc network","data access","cachedata","cachepath","data path","hybridcache","query delay","message complexity"]}],"abstract":"Most researches in ad hoc networks focus on routing, and not much work has been done on data access. A common technique used to improve the performance of data access is caching. Cooperative caching, which allows the sharing and coordination of cached data among multiple nodes, can further explore the potential of the caching techniques. Due to mobility and resource constraints of ad hoc networks, cooperative caching techniques designed for wired network may not be applicable to ad hoc networks. In this paper, we design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques to efficiently support data access in ad hoc networks. We first propose two schemes: cachedata which caches the data, and cachepath which caches the data path. After analyzing the performance of those two schemes, we propose a hybrid approach (hybridcache) which can further improve the performance by taking advantage of cachedata and cachepath while avoiding their weaknesses. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the query delay and message complexity when compared to other caching schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supporting cooperative caching in ad hoc networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354674.pdf","startPage":"2537","endPage":"2547 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Supporting cooperative caching in ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354674/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244064","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting cooperative caching in ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059405S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1354675,"authors":[{"name":"Yung Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"lastName":"Yung Yi","id":"37274318600"},{"name":"S.

In a wireless network, an important constraint that arises is that due to the MAC (media access control) layer. Many wireless MACs use a time-division strategy for channel access, where, at any point in space, the physical channel can be accessed by a single user at each instant of time. We develop a fair hop-by-hop congestion control algorithm with the MAC constraint being imposed in the form of a channel access time constraint, using an optimization based framework. In the absence of delay, we show that this algorithm is globally stable using a Lyapunov function based approach. Next, in the presence of delay, we show that the hop-by-hop control algorithm has the property of spatial spreading. In other words, focused loads at a particular spatial location in the network get \"smoothed\" over space. We derive bounds on the \"peak load\" at a node, both with hop-by-hop control, as well as with end-to-end control, show that significant gains are achieved with the hop-by-hop scheme, and validate the analytical results with simulation.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354675","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354675.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","startPage":"2548","endPage":"2558 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hop-by-hop congestion control over a wireless multi-hop network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hop-by-hop congestion control over a wireless multi-hop network","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354675/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244065","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354675/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hop-by-hop congestion control over a wireless multi-hop network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082413S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1354676,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We identify several advantages of MIMO links, and discuss key optimization considerations that can help in realizing an effective MAC protocol for such an environment.

We identify all anomalies that could exist in a single- or multi-firewall environment.

Essential to almost every intrusion detection system is the ability to search through packets and identify content that matches known attacks. Space and time efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at line rate. We examine string matching algorithms and their use for intrusion detection, in particular, we focus our efforts on providing worst-case performance that is amenable to hardware implementation. We contribute modifications to the Aho-Corasick string-matching algorithm that drastically reduce the amount of memory required and improve its performance on hardware implementations. We also show that these modifications do not drastically affect software performance on commodity processors, and therefore may be worth considering in these cases as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354682.pdf","startPage":"2628","endPage":"2639 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic memory-efficient string matching algorithms for intrusion detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Computer science","Hardware","Web server","Computer crime","Protection","Telecommunication traffic","Power engineering and energy","Software performance","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["string matching","security of data","Internet","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection system","deterministic memory-efficient string matching algorithm","worst-case performance","Aho-Corasick string-matching algorithm","Internet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic memory-efficient string matching algorithms for intrusion detection","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354682/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244072","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic memory-efficient string matching algorithms for intrusion detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04885S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"201","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1354683,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Shang","id":"37279556200"},{"name":"W.

MDS-MAP is a recent localization method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS). It uses connectivity information - who is within communications range of whom - to derive the locations of the nodes in the network, and can take advantage of additional data, such as estimated distances between neighbors or known positions for certain anchor nodes, if they are available. However, MDS-MAP is an inherently centralized algorithm and is therefore of limited utility in many applications. In this paper, we present a new variant of the MDS-MAP method, which we call MDS-MAP(P) standing for MDS-MAP using patches of relative maps, that can be executed in a distributed fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that the new algorithm not only preserves the good performance of the original method on relatively uniform layouts, but also performs much better than the original on irregularly-shaped networks. The main idea is to build a local map at each node of the immediate vicinity and then merge these maps together to form a global map. This approach works much better for topologies in which the shortest path distance between two nodes does not correspond well to their Euclidean distance. We also discuss an optional refinement step that improves solution quality even further at the expense of additional computation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","startPage":"2640","endPage":"2651 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354683.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved MDS-based localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354683/","displayDocTitle":"Improved MDS-based localization","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8230323","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved MDS-based localization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082047S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"363","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":1354684,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Ji","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiang Ji","id":"37271425100"},{"name":"Hongyuan Zha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Hongyuan Zha","id":"37271683100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8355-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"1354684","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":169,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1495},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354684","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Intelligent networks","Multidimensional systems","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Object detection","Network topology","Computer science","Computer network management","Engineering management","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks","telecommunication network management","iterative methods","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor positioning","wireless ad-hoc sensor network","multidimensional scaling","sensor network management","dimensionality reduction technique","coordinate alignment technique","adjacent sensor","iterative adjustment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354684","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354684.pdf","startPage":"2652","endPage":"2661 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor positioning in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks using multidimensional scaling","abstract":"Sensor Positioning is a fundamental and crucial issue for sensor network operation and management. In the paper, we first study some situations where most existing sensor positioning methods tend to fail to perform well, an example being when the topology of a sensor network is anisotropic. Then, we explore the idea of using dimensionality reduction techniques to estimate sensors coordinates in two (or three) dimensional space, and we propose a distributed sensor positioning method based on multidimensional scaling technique to deal with these challenging conditions. Multidimensional scaling and coordinate alignment techniques are applied to recover positions of adjacent sensors. The estimated positions of the anchors are compared with their true physical positions and corrected. The positions of other sensors are corrected accordingly. With iterative adjustment, our method can overcome adverse network and terrain conditions, and generate accurate sensor position. We also propose an on demand sensor positioning method based on the above method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354684/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"8244073","publicationDate":"2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1354684/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sensor positioning in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks using multidimensional scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor positioning in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks using multidimensional scaling","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062349S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1354686,"authors":[{"name":"T.

TPS relies on TDoA (time-difference-of-arrival) of RF signals measured locally at a sensor to detect range differences from the sensor to three base stations. These range differences are averaged over multiple beacon intervals before they are combined to estimate the sensor location through trilateration. A nice feature of this positioning scheme is that it is purely localized: sensors independently compute their positions. We present a statistical analysis of the performance of TPS in noisy environments. We also identify possible sources of position errors with suggested measures to mitigate them. Our scheme requires no time synchronization in the network and minimal extra hardware in sensor construction. TPS induces no communication overhead for sensors, as they listen to three beacon signals passively during each beacon interval. The computation overhead is low, as the location detection algorithm involves only simple algebraic operations over scalar values. TPS is not adversely affected by increasing network size or density and thus offers scalability. We conduct extensive simulations to test the performance of TPS when TDoA measurement errors are normally distributed or uniformly distributed. The obtained results show that TPS is an effective scheme for outdoor sensor self-positioning.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354687","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354687.pdf","startPage":"2685","endPage":"2696 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TPS: a time-based positioning scheme for outdoor wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354687/","displayDocTitle":"TPS: a time-based positioning scheme for outdoor wireless sensor networks","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244076","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1354687/","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TPS: a time-based positioning scheme for outdoor wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085372S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1354693,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Xin Wang","id":"37293614100"},{"name":"R.

CDMA systems are power- and interference-limited. Therefore, guard capacity in CDMA networks is soft, that is, a given capacity corresponds to variable number of connections. Thus, it is essential to adjust the guard capacity in response to changes in traffic conditions and user mobility. We propose two schemes for managing downlink CDMA radio resources: guard capacity adaptation based on dropping (GAD), and guard capacity adaptation based on prediction and dropping (GAPD). In both schemes, the guard capacity of a cell is dynamically adjusted so as to maintain the handoff dropping rate at a target level. In the second scheme, there is an additional, frequent adjustment component where guard capacity is adjusted based on soft handoff prediction. We show through extensive simulations that GAD and GAPD control the handoff dropping rate effectively under varying traffic conditions and system parameters. We also find that GAPD is more robust than GAD to temporal traffic variations and changes in control parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive and predictive downlink resource management in next generation CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354693","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354693.pdf","startPage":"2754","endPage":"2765 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive and predictive downlink resource management in next generation CDMA networks","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354693/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8221441","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive and predictive downlink resource management in next generation CDMA networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071159S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1354695,"authors":[{"name":"Bongyong Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Bongyong Song","id":"37274663600"},{"name":"R.L.

While a conventional array antenna system (AAS) has collocated, closely spaced antenna elements, a distributed antenna system (DAS) has largely spaced antennas over the entire area of radio coverage. To support multimedia applications requiring high bandwidth and on time delivery, we propose a set of highly spectrum efficient radio resource management algorithms. We focus on the optimization of downlink since many kinds of Internet traffic show the downlink dominance in their traffic asymmetry. To maximize the downlink throughput, we present a new transmit beamforming algorithm which can be equally applied to both DAS and AAS. The beamforming algorithm is integrated with a link scheduling algorithm that exploits the space division multiplexing (SDM) capability of multiple antenna systems to meet the QoS requirements of all terminals.

Although the corresponding global optimization problem has a non-trivial structure, and we cannot in general guarantee that a solution can be found using the Lagrangian method, we have strong experimental evidence that this is possible for a wide range of user utilities. In this case the global optimum can be achieved in a decentralized manner, using shadow prices to influence the individual user resource requests. Based on this evidence, the main contribution of the paper is to discuss how existing rate control and outer-loop power control procedures can obtain a simple and attractive form that takes into account, through shadow prices, the level of demand and supply in order to achieve efficient resource utilization. Moreover, we describe and evaluate approximations of the proposed resource control model that can simplify its application, and we present extensions of the model for the case where the packet success ratio depends on the transmission rate in addition to the signal quality, and for network paths containing multiple wireless links.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource control for loss-sensitive traffic in CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354696","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354696.pdf","startPage":"2790","endPage":"2799 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Resource control for loss-sensitive traffic in CDMA networks","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354696/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8221444","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource control for loss-sensitive traffic in CDMA networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096051S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1354697,"authors":[{"name":"Mung Chiang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Mung Chiang","id":"37273230100"},{"name":"J.

For each of the three cases considered in this paper, we present an algorithm that converges to the jointly optimal pair of rate vector and power vector. For the simple case when data rates are not limited by interferences, for example in single-cell downlink transmissions, we propose algorithm 1, which is an iterative bidding mechanism between the base station and mobile users, where knowledge about channel conditions and individual user utility functions is only needed locally at each user but not needed at the base station. In the case when data rates are limited by interferences, the utility maximization problem is complicated both by nonlinear coupling between powers and rates, and by interference among powers. Through centralized iterative steps, we propose algorithm 2, which converges to a joint and global optimum over the solution space of rates and powers. We then consider end-to-end transmissions in cellular networks, which traverse both wireless fading channels and many hops of wired links shared by other traffic. There is a tradeoff between attaining air-interface capacity in the wireless hop and controlling congestion in the wired backbone wide area network. We formulate this end-to-end resource allocation problem in such hybrid networks, and present a solution to obtain the Pareto optimal tradeoff between attaining wireless multi-access fading channel capacity and maximizing global network utility.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29753/01354697.pdf","startPage":"2800","endPage":"2811 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1354697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing supply and demand of bandwidth in wireless cellular networks: utility maximization over powers and rates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supply and demand","Bandwidth","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Iterative algorithms","Interference","Utility programs","Base stations","Fading","Wireless LAN","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cellular radio","supply and demand","iterative methods","fading channels","telecommunication traffic","telecommunication congestion control","radio links","radiofrequency interference","wide area networks","multi-access systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth supply and demand","wireless cellular network","wireless local area network","nonlinear network utility maximization","iterative bidding mechanism","rate vector","power vector","wireless fading channel","traffic","air-interface capacity","congestion control","end-to-end resource allocation problem","global network utility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Balancing supply and demand of bandwidth in wireless cellular networks: utility maximization over powers and rates","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1354697/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8221445","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing supply and demand of bandwidth in wireless cellular networks: utility maximization over powers and rates","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01354697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129215S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"29753","articleId":"1354697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1354730,"authors":[{"name":"Chuanhong Zhao","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"lastName":"Chuanhong Zhao","id":"37271179500"},{"name":"J.W.

By eliminating switching losses, high-efficiency operation at switching frequencies beyond 1 MHz is achieved. The design uses novel high-speed dead-time-locked-loops with fast dead-time error rejection to ensure zero-voltage-switching under dynamic loads and variable output conditions. The ZVS-QSW converter, which was implemented in a mixed-signal 0.18 m CMOS process, has a measured efficiency of 82% at 5 MHz with a 1.4 V output. The ZVS-QSW converter is intended to supply the next generation VLSI chips with a variable supply voltage for dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) applications. DVS refers to the real-time scaling of the supply voltage to the VLSI chip to minimize dynamic power consumption, while satisfying a variable target clock frequency. Several DVS strategies are examined, and it is shown that DVS can be applied to the ZVS-QSW converter using a dual-mode configuration. An experimental DVS test-bench was developed using a state-of-the-art Xilinx CPLD capable of operating from 1.35 V to 1.8 V.

A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a \"microgrid\". During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the microgrid's load from the disturbance (providing UPS services) without harming the transmission grid's integrity. This ability to island generation and loads together has a potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. In this model it is also critical to be able to use the waste heat by placing the sources near the heat load. This implies that a unit can be placed at any point on the electrical system as required by the location of the heat load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354758/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8212663","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1354758/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Microgrid: a conceptual solution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microgrid: a conceptual solution","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01354758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040074S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"909","xplore-issue":"29758","articleId":"1354758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1354760,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Though frequency- and Laplace-domain models for uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators are very valuable as they improve the general perception of the dynamic behavior of these modulators, the direct discrete design of the digital compensator requires a z-domain model for the combination modulator and converter For this purpose a new exact small-signal z-domain model is derived. In accordance with the zero-order-hold equivalent commonly used for 'regular' digital control systems, this z-domain model gives rise to the development of a uniformly-sampled pulse-width-modulator equivalent of the converter. This z-domain model is characterized by its capability to quantify the different dynamics of the converter for different modulators, its ease of use and its ability to predict the values of the control variables at the true sampling instants of the real system.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1354761","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

As an integral part of the drive, many faults occur within the inverter. One possible fault within the inverter is an open circuit transistor fault, whose diagnosis is subject of this paper. The practical performances of several open-circuit fault diagnostic methods are tested in simulation and experiment. An overview of the different strategies is given, including the algorithms used to localize the open transistor. Simulation results are presented and show different capabilities of each diagnostic strategy in terms of effectivity and false alarm resistivity for a voltage source inverter used as an active rectifier. The existing methods are further developed and adapted to a closed loop controlled active rectifier. An experimental setup in the laboratory is used to validate simulation results. Typical detection results are presented including time-to-detection measurements.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1354769","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

The rise of temperature within capacitor is the most significant factor upon ageing and so lifespan. To predict the ageing of the capacitor, a method of predictive maintenance has been developed. It consists in monitoring the voltage ripple of the capacitor. This ripple is the best indicator of its worn state. It is function of parameters such as input voltage, output current and ambient temperature. A reference system taking into account all these parameters is determined for sound capacitors. We deducted that the dispersion of input voltage had a weak influence upon voltage ripple compared to other parameters such as output current and ambient temperature. And precisely the temperature is being an influent parameter in the diagnosis, measurement must be very relevant. That is why we measured the internal temperature of capacitor which takes into account the ambient temperature but also the internal heating of capacitor. This measurement is done in an environment not confined for not which is distorted.

Planar spiral inductors can be fabricated with top metal layer of any standard CMOS IC process. These inductors have high series resistance due to low thickness of the metal layer. As the series resistance of inductor is directly related to converter efficiency, a custom process is to be devised in order to fabricate spiral inductors with higher metal thickness. In this paper, we present a MEMS based process called plastic deformation and magnetic assembly (PDMA) for fabricating inductors directly on to silicon chip. We detail the key fabrication steps in building these PDMA inductors. We also derive empirical expressions for estimating inductance and series resistance of these PDMA inductors from measured data. Finally, we compare these inductors with planar spiral inductors and present the advantages of using PDMA inductors in monolithic dc-dc converters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1354789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","accessionNumber":"8212690","htmlLink":"/document/1354789/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of PDMA inductors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication and characterization of PDMA inductors","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01354789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081205S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"29758","articleId":"1354789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1354801,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A three-dimensional copper electroforming process has been developed which offers an integrated-circuit designer larger-valued, higher-Q power inductors than are achievable with traditional thin-film processing. Such magnetic structures, whether fabricated in printed-circuit form or electroformed on a wafer, can be tapped to produce integrated multi-resonant L-C networks. These networks can develop much larger impedance than the corresponding untapped structure, provide self-shielding, eliminate switches from symmetric converter topologies, and otherwise reduce switch stresses. As part of the broader treatment, a new soft-switched radio-frequency power converter is introduced that demonstrates the reduction in peak device stress and passive-component size achievable with multi-resonant components. Taken together, the construction techniques, networks, and converter topologies presented here extend the power levels and applications for which passive components can be manufactured in an integrated fashion, alongside semiconductor switches and converter controls.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2004.1354801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29758","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

However large grid impedance variation is challenging the control and the grid filter design in terms of stability. In fact the PV systems are well suited for loads connected in a great distance to the transformer (long wires) and the situation becomes even more difficult in low-developed remote areas characterized by low power transformers and long distribution wires with high grid impedance. Hence a theoretical analysis is needed because the grid impedance variation leads to dynamic and stability problems both in the low frequency range (around the current controller bandwidth frequency) as well as in the high frequency range (around the LCL-filter resonance frequency). In the low frequency range the possible variation of the impedance challenges the design of resonant controllers adopted to mitigate the effect of the grid harmonic distortion on the grid current. In the high frequency range the grid impedance influence the frequency characteristic of the filter and the design of passive or active damping (to ensure stability) becomes more difficult. In this paper both topics are addressed and discussed with simulation and experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

The expression of equivalent output impedance is acquired through the close-loop transfer functions of double close-loop controlled inverter, then the characteristics of circulating current of parallel system are well researched from the point of view of equivalent output impedance. Theoretic analysis and experimental results prove that the magnitude of circulating current is proportional to the voltage difference and to the reciprocal of equivalent output impedance's modulus, the ratio of reactive and real power circulation is determined by the tangent of output impedance's angle.

EMI filters are necessary to insure the electromagnetic compatibility. Conventional discrete EMI filters are consisted of a fairly large number of components, with different shapes, sizes and form factors, and they are manufactured by different processing and packaging technologies, of which may include labor intensive processing steps. As a result, discrete EMI filters are usually bulky, high profile, with poor space and material utilization factors. In addition to that, because of the parasitic parameters of the discrete components and the interconnection board layout, the high frequency attenuation of discrete EMI filters is reduced. Hence the effective filter frequency range is limited. Aiming at these issues, integration technologies for EMI filters are studied. Our goal is to accomplish integrated EMI filters with structural, functional and processing integration to achieved smaller size, lower profile, better performance and reduced fabrication time and cost.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2004.1354862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29758","startPage":"4873","endPage":"4880 Vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

We show how some of the econometric measures can meaningfully capture the user decisions/actions (e.g., churning) that can potentially be utilized by the providers in managing radio resources (e.g., bandwidth) in wireless data networks. In particular, by modeling the interaction between a service provider and its customers (or users) as a non-cooperative game, we propose a novel cross-layer resource management framework for integrated admission and rate control in CDMA networks. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate how the proposed framework can help minimize customer churning and maximize revenue for the wireless operators, yet optimizing customer satisfaction by providing differentiated quality of service to different classes of users.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2004.1355031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/29764/01355031.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2004.1355031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An econometric model for resource management in competitive wireless data networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1355031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355031/","displayDocTitle":"An econometric model for resource management in competitive wireless data networks","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8196240","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1355031/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An econometric model for resource management in competitive wireless data networks","sourcePdf":"01355031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082442S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"29764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"29764","articleId":"1355031","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1355058,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is demonstrated that such estimator, in contrast to conventional model-based approaches, does not depend on a knowledge of machine parameters. It is further shown that accurate estimates can be obtained in situation of varying load without the need for explicit load monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355058","pdfPath":"/iel5/9371/29762/01355058.pdf","startPage":"3301","endPage":"3305 Vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

The controller guarantees regulation and balance of the output capacitors voltages, as well as a close to unity power factor, simultaneously. The design is based on a model in /spl alpha//spl beta//spl gamma/-coordinates of the three level converter. Special attention is given to the /spl gamma/-component of the control input, since it has direct influence in the balancing of the capacitors voltages, represented here as the arithmetic difference of voltages. Moreover, it is shown that this difference is polluted by a periodic disturbance, which is also compensated by the proposed controller by adding an adaptive term to the control law. After some transformations, this adaptive term is finally reduced to a bank of resonant filters. Simulations results are presented to asses the performance of the proposed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355086/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"8169464","publicationDate":"2004","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1355086/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Control of a three level converter used as a synchronous rectifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of a three level converter used as a synchronous rectifier","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01355086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054355S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"29762","articleId":"1355086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1355099,"authors":[{"name":"F.Z.

Many implementations have been presented in literature DTC algorithm requires velocity for some parts and flexibility for other parts. Digital-signal-processors (DSP) have been used for flexibility, but field-programmable-gate-arrays (FPGA) have been preferred for velocity. Using one device (DSP or FPGA) for DTC implementation has been reported as not optimal. Codesign appears as a promising methodology for partitioning the DTC algorithm between flexible and fast parts. Codesign requires user-specifications to help the partitioning with regard to the awaited control performances. Authors discuss two experimental implementations at extremities of the codesign space, i.e. full-software or full-hardware implementation. For each implementation, the DTC algorithm requires adaptations. Authors detail each development, and full-codes are available on a dedicated web-site. Validation results are presented for both implementations. Performances, advantages, and limitations of both implementations are compared. The necessary specifications for codesign development may then be identified.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355109","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

For heavy loads, the converter runs in fixed-frequency continuous conduction mode (CCM). At light loads, it enters discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with synchronous rectification. At still lighter loads, synchronous rectification is disabled in DCM. At very light loads, the converter operates in variable-frequency pulse skipping mode. The synchronous rectifier (SR) timing is scheduled as a function of the load current, enabling appropriate transition among the modes. An on-line adaptive algorithm to optimize the SR timing, based on power loss minimization, is presented. This control strategy is particularly well suited for a digital controller implementation, since it uses sophisticated computations, while not requiring high analog-to-digital conversion rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

This paper presents a modified correlation method for system identification of power converters with digital control. By injecting a multiperiod pseudo random binary signal (PRBS) to the control input of a power converter, the system frequency response can be derived by cross-correlation of the input signal and the sensed output signal. Compared to the conventional cross-correlation method, averaging the cross-correlation over multiple periods of the injected PRBS can significantly improve the identification results in the presence of PRBS-induced artifacts, switching and quantization noises. An experimental digitally controlled forward converter with an FPGA-based controller is used to demonstrate accurate and effective identification of the converter control-to-output response.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355134","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Differently from the topology presented in [G.Spiazzi et al., (2002)], the transformer reset is obtained by using an active clamp subcircuit instead of a lossless passive snubber. This solution avoids the use of a second inductor and auxiliary diodes and allows a better exploitation of the converter components, since now both the main and the auxiliary switch turn on at zero voltage and zero current, and they turn off at zero voltage by using a loss-less capacitor. The resulting topology is practically identical to that of an active-clamped flyback converter, except for the reversed transformer secondary side polarity. Thus, in addition to the converter analysis, the paper presents a comparison between the proposed converter and the active-clamped flyback converter, by testing two prototypes rated for 48 W output power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1355152/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8162066","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the active-clamped soft-switched forward converter without output filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the active-clamped soft-switched forward converter without output filter","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01355152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045253S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"29762","articleId":"1355152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1355167,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The analysis is focused on the voltage-balancing issue, since this is a very difficult task in high-order multilevel converters. Two strategies for selecting redundant vectors in the space-vector diagram are explained; both of them are based on minimizing a quadratic parameter related with voltage imbalance in the capacitors. Simulation results show similar behavior of the four-level converter for both modulation strategies. As expected, voltage balance cannot be achieved for some operating conditions that involve deep modulation indices and the existence of active currents. The limits in which the four-level converter cannot achieve charge balance by nearest-three-vector modulation are verified.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2004.1355180","startPage":"3988","endPage":"3993 Vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

For instance, the voltage quality during a short circuit is increased and therefore the fault current is reduced. Distortions caused by a three phase short can be reduced to a few 100 /spl mu/s, in contrast to some 100 ms achieved with present technology. Major drawbacks of all solutions for SCBs presented so far are material costs and on-state losses. Primarily because of these disadvantages SCB systems have not undergone industrial realization. Consequently, new solutions should be developed which are much more cost effective and offer reduced on-state losses. This paper presents a different conceptual approach based on active thyristor circuits and on auxiliary circuits, which are of utmost importance for the design of such kind of systems. It has been shown that forced commutation circuits are able to turn-off short circuits in medium-voltage grids actively and thus rapidly. Therefore, the overall life-cycle costs are reduced significantly. After a presentation of the SCB system, the critical design of the auxiliary circuits are discussed. There is a comparison of one conventional and two new innovative circuits for charging the commutation capacitor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel solid-state circuit breaker based on active thyristor topologies","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355232","startPage":"2559","endPage":"2564 Vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2004.1355232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29755","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

The new concept stands out due to its stringent modular construction as well as its extremely good control characteristics. This new M/sup 2/LC concept is well suitable for a wide range of high voltage applications. The basic working principle as well as the static and dynamic behaviour is explained in detail on a single-phase AC/AC-converter enabling four-quadrant operation. The M/sup 2/LC-family has already been introduced and examined for applications like traction converters, operating directly on the power line, and network interties [Marquardt, R et al., 2003 and Lesnicar, A et al., 2002]. With this prototype converter system, the characteristics of various different M/sup 2/LC-topologies can be investigated, including single or three phase DC/AC converters as well as multiphase AC/AC converters. The prototype converter has been designed in such a way that its configuration can be quickly changed between wide ranges of topologies. A flexible control system has been implemented, which is capable of controlling up to 32 IGBTs per converter arm, independently. Next to the presentation of the converter and its control system, measurement results are presented including converter operation.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355234","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Higher power levels are anticipated for offshore applications. To limit mechanical stresses and power surges in these high-power systems speed-control is necessary. The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system, used like a synchronous generator, is a viable alternative to adjust speed over a wide range while keeping the cost of the power converter minimal. A four-quadrant IGBT AC-to-AC converter is used to feed power bi-directionally to the rotor. However, with respect to reliability the power converter turns out to be the weakest link of the whole system. Contradictory to traction applications very few measurements of the real stresses in wind turbines have been done up to now. This paper describes how the DFlG-system causes very low output frequencies at full load-current. The corresponding IGBT-Chip temperature is simulated using Flomerics \"Flotherm\" FEM-program and verified at the test-bench. Long-term testings with three different converters have been performed and the results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355237","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Moreover, when the PTs are driven by a voltage-fed inverter and its DC supply voltage is used to control the lamp voltage, the relation between the control variable and the lamp current can become nonmonotonic, depending also on the coupling network used between the inverter and the PT. This paper extends the analysis reported in Spiazzi, G. et al.

Due to their superior properties they have the potential to be widely used in low voltage networks (up to 1000 V a.c.) as an electronic load feeder to electronically switch ohmic-inductive loads such as motors or electric heaters. Because of their specific on-resistance which is reduced in comparison to equivalent conventional power devices based on silicon the on-state losses are much closer to those of mechanical contacts. Thus, power dissipation of switchgear and switchboards is in the range of that of mechanical switches. In the field of electronic switching technology, we distinguish between AC51 and AC53 utilization category. Whereas AC51 characterizes ohmic loads, e. g. electric heaters, AC53 describes make and break operations with induction motors whose starting current amounts from 4 to 9 times the rated current. In the present paper a model is introduced to anticipate the performance as well as to describe the electrical and thermal behavior of SiC-power devices during short circuit operation and when conducting the rated current in both, AC51 and AC53, modes. The results obtained from this model agree very well with measurements performed on an ohmic-inductive circuit.

A reduced form genetic algorithm (RGA) is employed to tune control point of the B-spline membership functions (BMFs) and the weightings of the fuzzy neural network (FNN). The proposed FNN with RGA (FNNRGA) optimization approach can achieve the faster learning rate and lower estimating error than the conventional gradient descent method. The validity of the SOC estimator is further verified by a constructed multiple input multiple output (MIMO) FNN structure for estimating the SOCs of battery powered ES. A fixed velocity discharging profiles of the ES batteries are investigated to train the FNN for precise estimating the SOCs of the battery strings. Furthermore, a testing data profile is used to demonstrate the superior robust and over-fitting suppressed performance of the proposed method. The estimated SOCs are directly compared with the actual SOCs under different FNN methods, verifying the accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent modeling method.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355270","startPage":"2759","endPage":"2765 Vol.4","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

This technique uses additional passive components to inject a compensation current that cancels the parasitic current, thereby improving high-frequency filtering performance. Two implementation approaches for this technique are introduced. The first implementation achieves cancellation using an additional small winding on the filter inductor and a small capacitor. This approach is effective where very high coupling of the windings can be achieved or where only moderate performance improvements are required. The second implementation utilizes a small RF transformer in parallel with the filter inductor to inject cancellation currents from the compensation capacitor. This technique requires an additional component (the transformer), but can provide a high degree of cancellation. Experimental results confirm the theory in both implementations.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355331","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Therefore switching events take place at zero current (ZCS) without auxiliary commutation elements, which is an important precondition for reaching higher transmission frequencies. For this application a special inverter was developed. The phase-shifted controlled bridge at the primary side is equipped with IGBT and freewheeling SiC Schottky diodes. Because of their ultra low reverse recovery charge, the operation behaviour is much better compared to fast Si diodes. The different switching events of the inverter with freewheeling SiC Schottky diodes are investigated in detail. An experimental arrangement transfers an electric power of 1 kW through an air gap of 300 mm. At a 100 kHz transmission frequency the overall efficiency, including magnetic and power electronic components, is greater than 80%.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355378","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

During sunny days, when the maximum power point of the photovoltaic (PV) array moves very slowly, the sampling interval T, must be set as short as possible without causing instability. If the algorithm samples the array voltage and current too quickly, it is subjected to possible mistakes caused by the transient behavior of the PV array+converter system, thus missing temporarily the MPP. As a consequence, the algorithm can be confused, the energy efficiency decays, and the operating point can become unstable, entering disordered behaviors. The solution proposed in this paper lies in choosing T, according to the converter's dynamics. The choice of the value of T, according to the proposed approach ensures a three-level steady-state duty-cycle swing around the MPP, whatever the duty-cycle step-size and the irradiance level are.

It is proposed that two inverters (a shunt and a series) are used for each distributed generation (DG) system in the microgrid. For each inverter, both positive-and negative-sequence components are controlled to compensate for the effects caused by the unbalanced utility grid voltages. Specifically, the shunt inverter is controlled to ensure balanced voltages within the microgrid and to regulate power dispatches among parallel-connected DG systems, while the series inverter balances the line currents by injecting appropriate voltage components. A current-limiting algorithm is also proposed and integrated within the inverter control schemes to protect the microgrid from large fault currents during utility voltage sags (balanced or unbalanced).

The induction generator is operated in indirect vector control mode, where the d-axis current controls the excitation level and the q-axis current controls the generator torque, by which the speed of the induction generator is controlled according to the variation of the wind speed in order to produce the maximum output power. The generated power flows into the utility grid through the back-to-back PWM converter. The grid-side converter controls the DC link voltage and the line-side power factor by the q-axis and the d-axis current control, respectively.

Based on auto-master-slave control technique, the control circuitry employs the real power share bus and reactive power share bus interconnecting all the paralleled inverters. With the power share buses and the power deviation controllers, the paralleled inverter with highest output power becomes the master inverter; other inverters become slave inverters. Master inverter drive the power bus, and the power deviations in slave inverter module are calculated by the power sharing controller. Hereafter, the inverters compensate for the frequency and amplitude of output voltage, and then the unbalance power was eliminated.

The main disadvantages of these circuits are: high freewheeling loss of the primary leakage current, limited ZVS range for the lagging leg switches, the effects of the parasitic elements of the systems and others. To avoid these losses an energy recovery circuit based on an active voltage clamper is presented. The control circuit is designed having a number of soft switching transitions. The system has been verified by simulation and a prototype is being tested. In this paper we present an energy recovery system and a modulation sequence for the cycloconverter. The energy recovery system is based on an active voltage clamper; the voltage peaks energy is returned to the source. Furthermore, the presented modulation sequence is designed to have a maximum number of soft-switching transitions independent of the electric variables; which means minimum losses and independence on measurement systems limitations for modulation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Analog-digital conversion","Photovoltaic systems","Switching circuits","Bidirectional power flow","Leakage current","Zero voltage switching","Leg","Switches","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cycloconvertors","DC-AC power convertors","clamps","photovoltaic power systems","load flow","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regenerative active clamp circuit","DC/AC converters","high-frequency isolation","photovoltaic systems","bidirectional power flow","isolated power converters","freewheeling loss","primary leakage current","zero voltage switching","ZVS","lagging leg switches","energy recovery circuit","active voltage clamper","control circuit","soft switching transitions","modulation sequence","cycloconverter","voltage peaks energy","electric variables"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355439","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Similar to other sensorless methods based on signal injection, the resulting control signals of the indirect flux detection method by on-line reactance measurement is influenced by every saliency, for example, the saturation based, the slotting, and the anisotropy saliency as well as by load and flux level. Since these influences are extremely dependent on the machine design, they can hardly be calculated in advance and removed by filtering or digital signal processing. However, the possibility of utilizing a neural network for learning the individual dependencies and removing the unwanted influences can provide a very satisfactory result. Since the easy implementation of a neural network does only use a small amount of calculation power, the algorithms can be implemented even in low-cost signal processors. Measurements on mechanical sensorless controlled induction machines present adequate results up to about rated load, depending on the transient electrical behaviour, and with this on the design parameters of the induction machine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355480/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8199638","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1355480/","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combination of signal injection and neural networks for sensorless control of inverter fed induction machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combination of signal injection and neural networks for sensorless control of inverter fed induction machines","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01355480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044058S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"29761","articleId":"1355480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1355504,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The topological structure of these converters in relation to their hard-switched PWM converters is highlighted. With proper designation of the circuit variables (throw voltage V and the pole current I), all these converters are seen to be governed by an identical set of equations. In this framework, these circuits exhibit 6 sub-periods per cycle with identical current waveform in the resonant inductor. With idealized switches, the steady-state performance is obtainable in an analytical form. This set of equations may be solved through a simple spreadsheet programme. The steady-state performance provides a design constraint on the normalized current. The conversion ratio of the converter is also readily available. A generalized equivalent circuit emerges for all these converters from this steady-state conversion ratio. It is interesting to note that this equivalent circuit provides a dynamic model as well. The circuit model proposed in this paper enables one to use the familiar state space averaged results of the standard PWM DC-to-DC converters (both steady-state and dynamic) for their ZVS active clamp counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355504","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Semiconductor manufacturers are making efforts to design chips with higher blocking voltages, but for reliability and cost purposes, an easier solution today would be to use standard IGBTs. This paper describes the behaviour of 3.3 kV, 100 A chips connected in series and driven with an active gate control circuit which balances the voltage during both static and dynamic phase. The first part of the article presents the theoretical description of the principle and some design recommendations. The second part contains experimental results. These tests demonstrated that it is possible to safely turn off two times the nominal current under 4 kV DC link voltage. Finally, short-circuit turn-off has been also successfully tested, showing a good balancing of the overvoltages, even under such emergency conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Clamps","Circuits","Switches","Surge protection","Threshold voltage","Leakage current","Power electronics","Costs","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate bipolar transistors","overvoltage","power electronics","semiconductor device manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IGBT","active voltage balancing","insulated gate bipolar transistors","high voltage power electronics systems","active gate control circuit","emergency conditions","overvoltages","semiconductor manufacturers","3.3 kV","100 A"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355537","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

For manufacturers which have automated production lines, a few cycles of voltage sags can interrupt the entire production line and result in significant losses. For example, a typical semiconductor foundry in Taiwan loses US$ 100,000 to US$ 1,000,000 per sag event. As the high-tech manufacturers often gather closely in the industry park, the utility provides premium grid arrangement to the park, such as direct connection from the high-voltage transmission network, or independent power feeders. These approaches improve the reliability and quality of electric power. However, voltage sags still can not be eliminated. This paper discusses the use of thyristor-based solid-state transfer switches (STS) to provide ride-through during voltage sags for critical and sensitive industrial loads. A synchronous-reference-frame-based control method for identifying voltage sags is presented. Laboratory test results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the controller. Comparisons between the proposed controller and other control method proposed in previous literatures are also demonstrated to show the improvement.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355576","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

The PWM switching functions are defined based on the instantaneous power terms and the bandwidths of the two hysteresis comparators are dynamically adjusted to limit the averaged switching frequency. The controller directly uses the instantaneous power as control variables, to replace the current and voltage variables used in multi-loop control systems.

The objective is to reduce the capacitance of the DC-link capacitors without affecting the stability of the DC-voltage control; so, the rectifier controllers should anticipate the load variation of the N inverter-motor drive systems. This is achieved by introducing compensating structures in the rectifier controllers; then, the DC-link voltage becomes almost insensitive to the load variations. This makes possible to design independently the controllers of the controlled rectifier from those of the inverter-motor assemblies.

If the number of levels reaches infinity, the total harmonic distortion of the modulated voltage becomes practically zero. However, the numbers of the achievable voltage levels are limited by voltage unbalance problems, voltage clamping requirement, circuit layout, and packaging constraints. This paper presents a modulation strategy that enables to copy directly a modulated multilevel waveform on to output voltages of a (n+1) level inverter. The redundancies of different switch configurations are used to perform the voltage balancing of the DC link. The obtained modelling shows that high voltage multi levels are obtained by combination of n different three-level functions, which are called modulation functions. Therefore, a novel PWM strategy is designed to generate n fictive modulated voltage systems via the direct width modulation and the position setting of modulation functions. Simulation results are presented for a five-level inverter. Experimental results are given for a three-level inverter.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2004.1355625","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1391 Vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

This objective can be obtained by replacing the ideal relay characteristic of the sliding controller with a variable hysteresis band.

Recent results on the averaging of dithered switching systems are exploited in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to provide insights for the design of shape and parameters of the signal to be injected.

In recent years, large-scale and high-speed FPGAs make it possible to realize complicated control calculation with very high speed execution time. Calculation time for FPGA depends on the circuit design, especially how to construct the parallel processing circuit in the chip. Moreover, the latest FPGA contain embedded RAM, CPU core, DSP block, and it is possible to design a highspeed calculation circuit simply. Up to now, the digital feedback inverter control constructed by the software controller using DSP. DSP software is treated as a sequential process, so some calculation time is necessary. Since the finite time is required for the control calculation after measuring signals, it is impossible to realize the control law which use the k's sampling data to the k's control output. On the other hand, using FPGA based hardware controller, parallel processing can be realized. As the result, FPGA based control system makes it possible to realize the digital control system with negligible sampling delay and calculation time delay. In this paper, an instantaneous deadbeat control for three phase PWM inverter using FPGA based hardware controller is proposed. All the control calculation block, AD interface block and pulse pattern generation block are implemented in one FPGA chip. The characteristics of the proposed control method were verified through simulations and experiments. A design concept of the experimental system is also proposed.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355712","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

It can remove the common-mode voltage produced by the inverter from the motor terminals.

The fast response and extremely low coil current errors needed for good image quality in MRI systems are one of the main challenges for the designer. This paper presents new power stage architecture for the gradient amplifier, and two different control modulation techniques. The power stage consists of three full-bridges in a stack configuration operated with interleaved switching to deliver the required output voltage with high-frequency current ripple. One of the bridges has 400 V input voltage and switches at high frequency to provide high bandwidth, the other two bridges have 800 V and switch at lower frequency for loss reduction. The modulation technique is crucial to achieve the required waveform accuracy; a fully digital control provides great flexibility on the control. The paper explores two modulation options; one that minimizes the switching losses, but that will require bidirectional power supplies for some waveforms, and another with higher losses but more suited for arbitrary waveforms. The experimental results show the waveform accuracy from the amplifier implementation with the selected control.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2004.1355752","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

The working principle consists of modulating the original constant clock frequency, in order to spread each single harmonic energy into a certain frequency band, thus reducing amplitudes at each individual frequency. Nowadays, the switching frequency of power converters has been increasing up to values that make feasible the application of such techniques to reduce EMI emissions in power circuits. This paper deals with SSCG applied to reduction of EMI emissions in switched power converters, following certain modulation profiles. It is focussed on studying the effectiveness of EMI reduction as a function of frequency ranges, modulation profiles and other modulation parameters. A buck converter, whose switching frequency can be swept from 100 kHz to 1 MHz, has been used for experimental validation. Conducted disturbances produced by the converter, using different modulation parameters, were measured and compared with those produced by the same converter when driven with the classical constant frequency, variable duty, switching pattern. Significant reductions in conducted EMI may be observed. Optimal modulation profiles and parameters are identified.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9371/29757/01355758.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"296 Vol.1","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

In the single-phase PWM rectifier, it is well known that a power pulsation with twice the utility frequency is contained in the output power. In a conventional PWM rectifier, electrolytic capacitors with large capacitance have been used in order to smooth the DC voltage. However, lifetime of those capacitors is shortened by the power pulsation with twice utility frequency. The authors have been studied two kinds of DC ripple compensation circuits, such the authors call an inductive storage method and a capacitive storage method, those enable to transfer the ripple energy appeared on the output DC capacitors into the energy in an additional inductor and additional small capacitors. Hence, extension of the lifetime of the converter can be expected because the small film capacitor substitutes for the large electrolytic capacitors. Moreover, the inductance and capacitance region in which the DC ripple energy can be compensated completely and the overall dimensions of the energy storage devices are shown. Finally, experimental results of compensation characteristics on both the steady state and transient state are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355762","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Basic behavior of the NPC topology brings significant advantages to the low voltage applications as well. Especially, the lower voltage steps associated with the switching help in the mitigation of problems related to surge voltages at the motor terminals, leakage current, shaft voltage and bearing current, and so on.

Electrical power networks are being pushed closer to their limits, while at the same time higher reliability and efficiency are demanded. As a result, electrical equipment manufacturers are developing advanced equipment and installations to meet these requirements. Part of the challenge in designing such apparatus is the need to accurately simulate (prove) and test these devices before they are installed in an actual power system. The real time digital simulator (RTDS) allows developers to accurately and efficiently simulate electrical power systems and their ideas to improve them. The RTDS simulator operates in real time, therefore not only allowing the simulation of the power system, but also making it possible to test physical protection and control equipment. This gives developers the means to prove their ideas, prototypes and final products in a realistic environment. This paper will summarize the fundamental design of the RTDS simulator, with particular emphasis on recent developments and enhancements. It will also describe practical applications of the simulator in the various stages of power system design, testing and implementation. A brief description of ongoing development for the real time simulation of voltage source converter (VSC) converters is included.","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

The power supply design is based on piezoelectric transformers. The use of piezoelectric transformers (PZTs), instead of conventional magnetic ones, allows a significant reduction of the converter's size and component count. The particular features of the piezoelectric transformer allow the designer to directly connect the lamp to the secondary side of the device without the need for the typical ballast capacitor. Besides, the start up over-voltage is automatically generated with no need for input voltage amplitude or frequency modulation. On the other hand, the peculiar PZT secondary side arrangement and its high voltage, low current operation, call for particular care in the implementation of the LCD dimming circuit. The paper describes the different power supply components, particularly focusing on the PZT characteristics, outlines the design procedure for the output stage of the power supply (i.e. a resonant half-bridge inverter) and discusses the LCD brightness control strategy. Experimental results coming from a preindustrialised prototype of the converter are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1355780/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8169365","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cold cathode fluorescent lamp power supply based on piezoelectric transformers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cold cathode fluorescent lamp power supply based on piezoelectric transformers","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01355780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049144S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"29757","articleId":"1355780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1355788,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Then a family of inductor-less bus converters is proposed to overcome the limitations. In the new bus converter, magnetizing current is used to achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on for all switches. The resonant concept is used to achieve zero-current-switching (ZCS) without turn-off loss and body diode loss. Meanwhile, the self-driven method can be easily applied to save drive loss in the synchronous rectifiers. Based on these concepts, a full-bridge bus converter is built in the quarter-brick size to verify the analysis. The experimental results indicate that it can achieve 95% efficiency at 500 W, 12 V/45 A output.

A new kind of three-phase multilevel CSI topology is presented in this paper. The new multilevel CSI's synthesize the staircase current wave from several levels of balance inductor currents. The switching strategy that can ensure equal current division among the branches and current harmonics reduction is presented.

The rectifier requires an LC filter connected at its input terminals, which constitutes an LC resonant mode. The lightly damped LC filter is prone to series and parallel resonances when tuned to a system harmonic either from the utility or from the PWM rectifier. These issues are traditionally addressed at the design stage by properly choosing the filter resonant frequency. This approach may result in a limited performance since the LC resonant frequency is a function of the power system impedance, which usually varies with power system operating conditions. In this paper, an active damping control method is proposed for the reduction in line current THD of high power current source rectifiers operating at a switching frequency of only 540 Hz. Two types of LC resonances are investigated: the parallel resonance excited by harmonic currents drawn by the rectifier and the series resonance caused by harmonic pollution in the source voltage. It is demonstrated through simulation and experiments that the proposed active damping control can effectively reduce the line current THD caused by both parallel and series resonances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1355807/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8169389","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Active damping control of a high power PWM current source rectifier for line current THD reduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping control of a high power PWM current source rectifier for line current THD reduction","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01355807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038799S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29757","articleId":"1355807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1355821,"authors":[{"name":"X.

In those conditions, the choice of a diesel powered locomotive is due to the reduced costs compared to the infrastructure cost of a standard electric train. The main inconvenience of the diesel technology is the primary energy source: oil resources are not infinite, prices are difficult to forecast and CO/sub 2/ production increases global warming. It's therefore important to develop new strategies to increase the energy efficiency of a diesel-electric train. To reach that goal, a system with supercapacitive energy storage will be proposed in this paper. The production and exploitation costs of the proposed system will be studied in more detail. The proposed solution will reduce diesel consumption and therefore also CO/sub 2/and other pollutant emissions while being economically viable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2004","publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1355830/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8169409","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power assistance for diesel-electric locomotives with supercapacitive energy storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power assistance for diesel-electric locomotives with supercapacitive energy storage","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"01355830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066834S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9371","isNumber":"29757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9371","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"29757","articleId":"1355830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1355834,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Calculations indicate that a 1 MVA transformer operating at 4 kHz could be realized with an active weight of below 150 kg for both dry and liquid-immersed transformer concepts. The transformers are modeled magnetically, electrically and thermally, and a geometric optimization procedure based on a cost function is applied to achieve an optimum design.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355834","startPage":"704","endPage":"710 Vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

In this paper, a novel single-stage AC/DC converter which dramatically reduces the devices count and circuit complexity is introduced. The converter integrates the function of input current shaping, tight output voltage regulation and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) active-clamping. With a coupled primary winding, the rectifier diodes and the bulk inductor in the conventional PFC cell are eliminated in the proposed converter. By choosing appropriate turn-ratio of the windings, the voltage across the bulk capacitor can be effectively controlled, and the input current harmonics can be limited to meet IEC 61000-3-2 Class D specifications. The converter is analyzed and verified with 48 V/70 W output and the line input voltage range is from 90 to 260 V. It is shown that the power dissipated on two active switches can be kept around 1.82-3.18 W for universal line input voltages.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","Zero voltage switching","Voltage control","Circuit topology","Costs","Complexity theory","Coupling circuits","Rectifiers","Diodes","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","switching convertors","power factor correction","transformer windings","rectifiers","semiconductor diodes","inductors","power conversion harmonics","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-stage AC-DC converter","universal line application","low cost","low-power application","current shaping","voltage regulation","zero-voltage-switching","ZVS","active-clamping","coupled primary winding","rectifier diode","inductor","PFC cell","current harmonics","IEC 61000-3-2 Class D specification","power dissipation","active switch","48 V","90 to 260 V","1.82 to 3.18 W","70 W"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.2004.1355844","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE 35th Annual Power Electronics Specialists Conference (IEEE Cat.

Many schemes have been proposed to suppress ICI, but they are computationally complex or at the price of sacrificing bandwidth. In some cases, such as high-density television (HDTV) broadcasting and satellite OFDM systems, the very long delay spreads pose the possibility that the channel length exceeds that of the moderate cyclic prefix (CP), resulting in intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI). A time-domain equalizer (TEQ) is usually used in the receiver to reduce the duration of the overall response of the transmission system, and therefore minimize the ISI and ICI. However, the optimum design of TEQ turns out to be a difficult task. The ICI's introduced by insufficient CP and channels variations are different and usually exploit different methods to mitigate them. In this paper, we provide an ICI and ISI analysis in time- and frequency- domain for OFDM systems with insufficient CP over time-variant channels. Basing on this analysis, we propose an iterative method for joint ICI and ISI cancellation whose complexity is linear in the OFDM symbol length. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate ICI and ISI introduced by channel variation and insufficient CP with high bandwidth efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2004.1355879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2004.1355879","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/28566/01355879.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=28566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICI and ISI analysis and mitigation for OFDM systems with insufficient cyclic prefix in time-varying channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"ICI and ISI analysis and mitigation for OFDM systems with insufficient cyclic prefix in time-varying channels","volume":"50","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"7943174","publicationDate":"Feb. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1355879/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICI and ISI analysis and mitigation for OFDM systems with insufficient cyclic prefix in time-varying channels","sourcePdf":"01355879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047117S","chronDate":"Feb.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"28566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"28566","articleId":"1355879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1355922,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Our approach is stated in the general case, and is illustrated for the 2-D separable and for the quincunx images. Results are shown for the JPEG2000 database and for satellite images acquired on a quincunx sampling grid. The design of efficient quincunx filters is a difficult challenge which has already been addressed for specific cases. Our approach enables the design of less expensive filters adapted to the signal statistics to enhance the compression efficiency in a more general case. It is based on a two-step lifting scheme and joins the lifting theory with Wiener's optimization. The prediction step is designed in order to minimize the variance of the signal, and the update step is designed in order to minimize a reconstruction error. Application for lossy compression shows the performances of the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8187107","pubMedId":"15575154","volume":"13","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1355939/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of signal-adapted multidimensional lifting scheme for lossy coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of signal-adapted multidimensional lifting scheme for lossy coding","sourcePdf":"01355939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125671S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"29774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"29774","articleId":"1355939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1355940,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An efficient copyright protection method that has been gaining popularity is watermarking, i.e., the embedding of a signature in a digital document that can be detected only by its rightful owner. Watermarks are usually blindly detected using correlating structures, which would be optimal in the case of Gaussian data. However, in the case of DCT-domain image watermarking, the data is more heavy-tailed and the correlator is clearly suboptimal. Nonlinear receivers have been shown to be particularly well suited for the detection of weak signals in heavy-tailed noise, as they are locally optimal. This motivates the use of the Gaussian-tailed zero-memory nonlinearity, as well as the locally optimal Cauchy nonlinearity for the detection of watermarks in DCT transformed images. We analyze the performance of these schemes theoretically and compare it to that of the traditionally used Gaussian correlator, but also to the recently proposed generalized Gaussian detector, which outperforms the correlator. The theoretical analysis and the actual performance of these systems is assessed through experiments, which verify the theoretical analysis and also justify the use of nonlinear structures for watermark detection. The performance of the correlator and the nonlinear detectors in the presence of quantization is also analyzed, using results from dither theory, and also verified experimentally.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally optimum nonlinearities for DCT watermark detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2004.837516","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/29774/01355940.pdf","startPage":"1604","endPage":"1617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2004.837516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1355940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Locally optimum nonlinearities for DCT watermark detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1355940/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8187108","pubMedId":"15575155","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally optimum nonlinearities for DCT watermark detection","sourcePdf":"01355940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106038S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"29774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"29774","articleId":"1355940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1355941,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Laung Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/29774/1355941/1355941-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Laung Lei received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C, in 1980, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Texas, Austin, in 1986.","From 1986 to 1988, he was an Assistant Professor in the Computer and Information Science Department, The Ohio State University, Columbus.

When an illegal replica is found in the market sometime later, the seller can determine the responsible distributor by examining the watermark embedded. However, the accusation against the charged distributor, who was the buyer in some earlier transaction, is objectionable because the seller also has access to the watermarked copies and, hence, is able to release such a replica on her own. In this paper, a watermarking protocol is proposed to avoid such difficulties, known as the customer's right problem, in the phase of arbitration. The proposed watermarking protocol also provides a fix to Memon and Wong's scheme by solving the unbinding problem. In addition, the buyer is no longer required to contact the watermark certification authority during transactions, and the anonymity of the buyer can be retained through a trusted third party. The result is an efficient and anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2004.837553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/29774/01355941.pdf","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2004.837553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient and anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1355941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355941/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient and anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocol","volume":"13","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8187109","pubMedId":"15575156","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1355941/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient and anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocol","sourcePdf":"01355941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070262S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"29774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"29774","articleId":"1355941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1355964,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

However, turbulence in the atmosphere leads to fades of varying depths, some of which may lead to heavy loss of data. We consider spatial diversity at both the transmitter and receiver, as well as time diversity as a means to mitigate the short-term loss of signal strength. Using direct detection receivers and binary pulse position modulation as an example, we derive the outage probability of spatial diversity and time diversity systems that use equal gain combining (EGC), optimal combining, and select-max combining. The power gain of using these diversity systems is found to be substantial, and the performance of equal gain combining is found to be almost as good as optimal combining. Hence, we feel diversity should be considered as one of the system techniques to improve channel performance in clear atmospheric optical channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1355985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","volume":"22","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8207675","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1355985/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Part 1: optical communication over the clear turbulent atmospheric channel using diversity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Part 1: optical communication over the clear turbulent atmospheric channel using diversity","sourcePdf":"01355985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113978S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"29776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"298","xplore-issue":"29776","articleId":"1355985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1356000,"authors":[{"name":"RongLin Li","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/29777/1356000/1356000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["RongLin Li (M'02\u2013SM'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 1983, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Chongqing University, China, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.","From 1983 to 1987, he worked as an electrical engineer with the Yunnan Electric Power Research Institute.

However, conventional differential lines on PCBs still have unsolved problems, such as crosstalk and radiated emission. When more than two differential pairs run in parallel, a line is coupled to the line adjacent to it because all the lines are parallel in a fixed order. Accordingly, the two lines that constitute a differential pair are subject to the differential-mode crosstalk that cannot be canceled out by virtue of the differential signaling. To overcome this, we propose a twisted differential line (TDL) structure on a high-speed multilayer PCB by using a concept similar to a twisted pair in a cable interconnection. It has been successfully demonstrated by measurement and simulation that the TDL is subject to much lower crosstalk and achieves a 13-dB suppression of radiated emission, even when supporting a 3-Gb/s data rate.","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2004.831838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/29777/01356001.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2004.831838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Twisted differential line structure on high-speed printed circuit boards to reduce crosstalk and radiated emission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356001/","displayDocTitle":"Twisted differential line structure on high-speed printed circuit boards to reduce crosstalk and radiated emission","volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8202536","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356001/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Twisted differential line structure on high-speed printed circuit boards to reduce crosstalk and radiated emission","sourcePdf":"01356001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048543S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"29777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"29777","articleId":"1356001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356017,"authors":[{"name":"H.K.

The algorithm referred to as growing and pruning (GAP)-RBF uses the concept of \"Significance\" of a neuron and links it to the learning accuracy. \"Significance\" of a neuron is defined as its contribution to the network output averaged over all the input data received so far. Using a piecewise-linear approximation for the Gaussian function, a simple and efficient way of computing this significance has been derived for uniformly distributed input data. In the GAP-RBF algorithm, the growing and pruning are based on the significance of the \"nearest\" neuron. In this paper, the performance of the GAP-RBF learning algorithm is compared with other well-known sequential learning algorithms like RAN, RANEKF, and MRAN on an artificial problem with uniform input distribution and three real-world nonuniform, higher dimensional benchmark problems. The results indicate that the GAP-RBF algorithm can provide comparable generalization performance with a considerably reduced network size and training time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2004.834428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29778","startPage":"2284","endPage":"2292","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/29778/01356018.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient sequential learning algorithm for growing and pruning RBF (GAP-RBF) networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1356018/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient sequential learning algorithm for growing and pruning RBF (GAP-RBF) networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8207607","pubMedId":"15619929","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient sequential learning algorithm for growing and pruning RBF (GAP-RBF) networks","sourcePdf":"01356018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093575S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"29778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"274","xplore-issue":"29778","articleId":"1356018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1356020,"authors":[{"name":"P.F.U.

Our robust estimator extends M-estimator Sample Consensus/Random Sample Consensus (MSAC/RANSAC) to use local surface orientation information, enhancing the accuracy of inlier/outlier classification when processing noisy range data describing multiple structures. An efficient approximation to the true geometric distance between a point and a quadric surface also contributes to effectively reject weak surface hypotheses and avoid the extraction of false surface components. Additionally, a genetic algorithm was specifically designed to accelerate the optimization process of surface extraction, while avoiding premature convergence. We present thorough experimental results with quantitative evaluation against ground truth. The segmentation algorithm was applied to three real range image databases and competes favorably against eleven other segmenters using the most popular evaluation framework in the literature. Our approach lends itself naturally to parallel implementation and application in real-time tasks. The method fits well into several of today's applications in man-made environments, such as target detection and autonomous navigation, for which obstacle detection, but not description or reconstruction, is required. It can also be extended to process point clouds resulting from range image registration.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2004.835082","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/29778/01356020.pdf","startPage":"2303","endPage":"2316","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2004.835082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range image segmentation into planar and quadric surfaces using an improved robust estimator and genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Range image segmentation into planar and quadric surfaces using an improved robust estimator and genetic algorithm","volume":"34","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8207609","pubMedId":"15619931","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1356020/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range image segmentation into planar and quadric surfaces using an improved robust estimator and genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"01356020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11356S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"29778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"29778","articleId":"1356020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1356021,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

KASER is a creative expert system. It is capable of deductive, inductive, and mixed derivations. Its qualitative creativity is realized by using a tree-search mechanism. The system achieves creative reasoning by using a declarative representation of knowledge consisting of object trees and inheritance. KASER computes with words and phrases. It possesses a capability for metaphor-based explanations. This capability is useful in explaining its creative suggestions and serves to augment the capabilities provided by the explanation subsystems of conventional expert systems. KASER also exhibits an accelerated capability to learn. However, this capability depends on the particulars of the selected application domain. For example, application domains such as the game of chess exhibit a high degree of geometric symmetry. Conversely, application domains such as the game of craps played with two dice exhibit no predictable pattern, unless the dice are loaded. More generally, we say that domains whose informative content can be compressed to a significant degree without loss (or with relatively little loss) are symmetric. Incompressible domains are said to be asymmetric or random. The measure of symmetry plus the measure of randomness must always sum to unity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2004.835081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/29778/01356021.pdf","startPage":"2317","endPage":"2329","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2004.835081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"KASER: knowledge amplification by structured expert randomization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","displayDocTitle":"KASER: knowledge amplification by structured expert randomization","volume":"34","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1356021/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8207610","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","pubMedId":"15619932","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"KASER: knowledge amplification by structured expert randomization","sourcePdf":"01356021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071674S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"29778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"29778","articleId":"1356021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1356023,"authors":[{"name":"S.

TA involves determining minimum cost links to form a communications network, by connecting a given set of terminals to a given collection of concentrators. Some previous approaches provide very good results if the cost associated with assigning a single terminal to a given concentrator is known. However, there are situations in which the cost of a single assignment is not known in advance, and only the cost associated with feasible solutions can be calculated. In these situations, previous algorithms for TA based on greedy heuristics are no longer valid, or fail to get feasible solutions. Our approach involves a Hopfield neural network (HNN) which manages the problem's constraints, whereas a GA searches for high quality solutions with the minimum possible cost. We show that our algorithm is able to achieve feasible solutions to the TA in instances where the cost of a single assignment in not known in advance, improving the results obtained by previous approaches. We also show the applicability of our approach to other problems related to the TA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8207612","pubMedId":"15619934","volume":"34","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1356023/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid Hopfield network-genetic algorithm approach for the terminal assignment problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid Hopfield network-genetic algorithm approach for the terminal assignment problem","sourcePdf":"01356023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15679S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"29778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"29778","articleId":"1356023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1356027,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

FROSAW relies on independent adaptation of whitening statistics in different depths and combining feature-based methods with anomaly detection using rules. Constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors are used for anomaly detection on the depth-dependent adaptively whitened data. A single CFAR confidence measure is computed via a function of order statistics. Anomalies are detected at locations with high CFAR confidence. Depth-dependent features are computed on regions containing anomalies. Rules based on the features are used to reject alarms that do not exhibit mine-like properties. The utility of combining the CFAR and feature-based methods is evaluated. The algorithms and analysis are applied to data acquired from tens of thousands of square meters from several outdoor test sites with a state-of-the-art array of GPR sensors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Landmine detection","Radar detection","Ground penetrating radar","Statistics","Sensor arrays","Detectors","Sensor systems","Linear antenna arrays","Radar clutter","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","remote sensing by radar","landmine detection","ground penetrating radar","feature extraction","adaptive signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["landmine detection","ground-penetrating radar","feature-based rules","order statistics","adaptive whitening","whitening statistics","anomaly detection","depth-dependent features","mine-like properties","data acquisition","GPR sensors","adaptive signal detection","constant false alarm rate detectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive signal detection","constant false alarm rate (CFAR)","ground-penetrating radar (GPR)","landmine detection","order statistics"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2004.837333","startPage":"2522","endPage":"2534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/29779/01356065.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2004.837333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting landmines with ground-penetrating radar using feature-based rules, order statistics, and adaptive whitening","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detecting landmines with ground-penetrating radar using feature-based rules, order statistics, and adaptive whitening","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8202962","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","volume":"42","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356065/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting landmines with ground-penetrating radar using feature-based rules, order statistics, and adaptive whitening","sourcePdf":"01356065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065851S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"29779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"29779","articleId":"1356065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1356066,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yan Zhang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Jilin University of Technology, Changchun, China, in 1993, 1996, and 1998, respectively.","From January 1999 to July 2004, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC.

Consequently, it is difficult to constitute a universal training set for design of detection or classification algorithms. In this paper, we develop an efficient procedure by which information-theoretic concepts are used to design the basis functions and training set, directly from the site-specific measured data. Specifically, assume that measured data (e.g., induction and/or magnetometer) are available from a given site, unlabeled in the sense that it is not known a priori whether a given signature is associated with a target or clutter. For N signatures, the data may be expressed as {x/sub i/,y/sub i/}/sub i=1,N/, where x/sub i/ is the measured data for buried object i, and y/sub i/ is the associated unknown binary label (target/nontarget). Let the N x/sub i/ define the set X. The algorithm works in four steps: 1) the Fisher information matrix is used to select a set of basis functions for the kernel-based algorithm, this step defining a set of n signatures B/sub n//spl sube/X that are most informative in characterizing the signature distribution of the site; 2) the Fisher information matrix is used again to define a small subset X/sub s//spl sube/X, composed of those x/sub i/ for which knowledge of the associated labels y/sub i/ would be most informative in defining the weights for the basis functions in B/sub n/; 3) the buried objects associated with the signatures in X/sub s/ are excavated, yielding the associated labels y/sub i/, represented by the set Y/sub s/; and 4) using B/sub n/,X/sub s/, and Y/sub s/, a kernel-based classifier is designed for use in classifying all remaining buried objects. This framework is discussed in detail, with example results presented for an actual buried-UXO site.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2004.836270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/29779/01356066.pdf","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2004.836270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of buried targets via active selection of labeled data: application to sensing subsurface UXO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of buried targets via active selection of labeled data: application to sensing subsurface UXO","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356066/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8202963","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of buried targets via active selection of labeled data: application to sensing subsurface UXO","sourcePdf":"01356066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067678S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"29779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"29779","articleId":"1356066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":1356080,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"1356080","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Physics","Spaceborne radar","Instruments","Satellites","Biographies","Error correction","Electronics industry","Chemistry","Industrial electronics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2004.839641","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/29779/01356080.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2004.839641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2680","endPage":"2680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correction to \"The Mean Echo and Echo Cross Product From a Beamforming Interferometric Altimeter and Their Application to Elevation Measurement\"","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Correction to \"The Mean Echo and Echo Cross Product From a Beamforming Interferometric Altimeter and Their Application to Elevation Measurement\"","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356080/","volume":"42","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1356080/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correction to \"The Mean Echo and Echo Cross Product From a Beamforming Interferometric Altimeter and Their Application to Elevation Measurement\"","sourcePdf":"01356080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02274S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"29779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","xplore-issue":"29779","articleId":"1356080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356090,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

This high ratio may result either from wide channel devices, designed to achieve high transconductance, or from short-channel-length devices used in high-frequency circuits. Since drain current is generally proportional to the W/L ratio, the effective gate-to-source voltage to achieve a desired drain current is typically quite low. In many cases, this set of circumstances leads to operation in the weak or moderate inversion region accompanied by electrical behavior that differs significantly from that in the strong inversion region. In designing analog MOS circuits, an understanding of operation below the strong inversion region is necessary to relate design predictions to simulation results. In addition, biasing simple amplifier stages near the weak or moderate inversion region can be used to advantage. Such a bias can lead to maximum voltage gain, low device dissipation, and minimum total harmonic distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","volume":"47","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8208870","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1356090/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Operation of analog MOS circuits in the weak or moderate inversion region","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of analog MOS circuits in the weak or moderate inversion region","sourcePdf":"01356090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060348S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"29780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"29780","articleId":"1356090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1356101,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

Data arrives in some random way and is queued according to the K destinations until transmitted. Time is divided into small scheduling intervals. Current systems can estimate the channel (e.g, via pilot signals) and use this information for scheduling. The issues are the allocation of transmitter power and/or time and bandwidth to the various queues in a queue and channel-state dependent way to assure stability and good operation. The decisions are made at the beginning of the scheduling intervals. Stochastic stability methods are used both to assure that the system is stable and to get appropriate allocations, under very weak conditions. The choice of Lyapunov function allows a choice of the effective performance criteria. The resulting controls are readily implementable and allow a range of tradeoffs between current rates and queue lengths. The various extensions allow a large variety of schemes of current interest to be covered. All essential factors are incorporated into a \"mean rate\" function, so that the results cover many different systems. Because of the non-Markovian nature of the problem, we use the perturbed Stochastic Lyapunov function method, which is well adapted to such problems.

First, we introduce the notion of cyclic pursuit by examining a system of identical linear agents in the plane. This idea is then extended to a system of wheeled vehicles, each subject to a single nonholonomic constraint (i.e., unicycles), which is the principal focus of this paper. The pursuit framework is particularly simple in that the n identical vehicles are ordered such that vehicle i pursues vehicle i+1 modulo n. In this paper, we assume each vehicle has the same constant forward speed. We show that the system's equilibrium formations are generalized regular polygons and it is exposed how the multivehicle system's global behavior can be shaped through appropriate controller gain assignments. We then study the local stability of these equilibrium polygons, revealing which formations are stable and which are not.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8202783","htmlLink":"/document/1356116/","displayDocTitle":"Formations of vehicles in cyclic pursuit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formations of vehicles in cyclic pursuit","sourcePdf":"01356116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086662S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"29781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"467","xplore-issue":"29781","articleId":"1356116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1356120,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

The proposed circuit is a modified Kerwin-Huelsman-Newcomb biquad filter that tunes itself to the incoming noise frequency using the zero tuning techniques. The circuit was implemented on a printed circuit board and it was successful in reducing noise by 15-20 dB in open space.

New expressions for the transfer functions are derived and mathematical properties revealed. Our contributions to the FIR case include a closed-form formula for the Farrow structure, a three-term recurrence relation based on the interpolation algorithm of Neville, a concise operator-based formula using the forward shift operator, and a continued fraction representation. Three types of structures are developed based on these formulas. Our formula for the Farrow structure enhances the existing contributions by Valimaki, and by Vesma and Sarama/spl uml/ki on the subsystems of the structure. For the IIR case, it is rigorously proved, using the theory of Pade approximants, that the continued fraction formulation of Tassart and Depalle yields all-pass fractional delay systems. It is also proved that the maximally flat all-pass fractional-delay systems are closely related to the Lagrange interpolation. It is shown that these IIR systems can be characterized using Thiele's rational interpolation algorithm. A new formula for the transfer function is derived based on the Thiele continued fractions. Finally, a new class of maximally flat FIR fractional-sample delay systems that exhibit an almost all-pass magnitude response is proposed. The systems possess a maximally flat group-delay response at the end frequencies 0 and /spl pi/, and are characterized by a closed-form formula. Their main advantage over the classical FIR Lagrange interpolators is the improved magnitude response characteristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"51","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8228131","htmlLink":"/document/1356159/","displayDocTitle":"Results on maximally flat fractional-delay systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Results on maximally flat fractional-delay systems","sourcePdf":"01356159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104194S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"29782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"29782","articleId":"1356159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1356160,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Wen Shou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/29782/1356160/1356160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Wen Shou received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, the B.S. degree in environmental engineering from the National Chen-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1999 and the M.S. degree in electrical and control engineering in 2001, from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., where he is working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and control engineering.","His current research interests are in the areas of artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, pattern recognition, image documentation and cellular neural networks."]},"lastName":"Yu-Wen Shou","id":"37269719800"},{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/29782/1356160/1356160-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Teng Lin (S'88\u2013M'91\u2013SM'99) received the B.S. degree in control engineering from the National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1986 and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.","Since August 1992, he has been with the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, NCTU, where he is currently the Associate Dean of the Engineering College and a Chair Professor of The Electrical and Control Engineering Department.

Instead of using the fixed filters for image descreening, we are equipped with a more pliable mechanism for classifications in screening patterns. Using CNN makes it possible to get an accurate texture classification result in a faster speed by its superiority of implementable hardware and the flexible choices of templates. The use of the GA here helps us to look for the most appropriate template for CNNs more adaptively and methodically. The evolved parameters in the template for CNNs can not only provide a quicker classification mechanism but also help us with a better texture classification for screening patterns. After the class of screening patterns in the querying images is determined by the trained GA-CNN-based texture classification system, the recommendatory filters are induced to solve the screening problems. The induction of the classification in screening patterns has simplified the choice of filters and made it valueless to determine a new structured filter. Eventually, our comprehensive methodology is going to be topped off with more desirable results and the indication for the decrease in time complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2004.836861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/29782/01356160.pdf","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2004.836861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image descreening by GA-CNN-based texture classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356160/","displayDocTitle":"Image descreening by GA-CNN-based texture classification","volume":"51","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356160/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8241532","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image descreening by GA-CNN-based texture classification","sourcePdf":"01356160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081379S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"29782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"29782","articleId":"1356160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356161,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A combined Gray/Ungerboeck scheme is used to label each QAM constellation. The Gray-labeled bits are protected using an irregular LDPC code with iterative soft-decision decoding, while other bits are protected using a high-rate Reed-Solomon code with hard-decision decoding (or are left uncoded). The rate of the LDPC code is selected by analyzing the capacity of the channel seen by the Gray-labeled bits and is made adaptive by selective concatenation with an inner repetition code. Using a practical bit-loading algorithm, we apply this coding scheme to an ensemble of frequency-selective channels with Gaussian noise. Over a large number of channel realizations, this coding scheme provides an average effective coding gain of more than 7.5 dB at a bit-error rate of 10/sup -7/ and a block length of approximately 10/sup 5/ b. This represents a gap of approximately 2.3 dB from the Shannon limit of the additive white Gaussian noise channel, which could be closed to within 0.8-1.2 dB using constellation shaping.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-capacity coding in multicarrier modulation systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836560","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29784/01356199.pdf","startPage":"1880","endPage":"1889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Near-capacity coding in multicarrier modulation systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1356199/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184474","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-capacity coding in multicarrier modulation systems","sourcePdf":"01356199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06103S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"29784","articleId":"1356199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356200,"authors":[{"name":"Lifang Li","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/29784/1356200/1356200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lifang Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1993 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 2000, all in electrical engineering.","From February 2000 to April 2000, she worked as a postdoctoral scholar in the Advanced Communications Systems Concepts Group, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, CA.

Similarly, we show that offset QPSK (OQPSK) can be decomposed into a \"degraded\" trellis encoder and a memoryless mapper. Based on the representations of OQPSK and MIL-STD SOQPSK as trellis-coded modulations (TCMs), we investigate the potential coding gains achievable from the application of simple outer codes to form a concatenated coding structure with iterative decoding. For MIL-STD SOQPSK, we describe the optimum receiver corresponding to its TCM form and then propose a simplified receiver. The bit-error rate (BER) performances of both receivers for uncoded and coded MIL-STD SOQPSK are simulated and compared with that of OQPSK and Feher-patented QPSK (FQPSK). The asymptotic BER performance of MIL-STD SOQPSK is also analyzed and compared with that of OQPSK and FQPSK. Simulation results show that, compared with their uncoded systems, there are significant coding gains for both OQPSK and MIL-STD SOQPSK, obtained by applying iterative decoding to either the parallel concatenated coding scheme or the serial one, even when very simple outer codes are used.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29784/01356200.pdf","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of coded OQPSK and MIL-STD SOQPSK with iterative decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356200/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of coded OQPSK and MIL-STD SOQPSK with iterative decoding","volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184475","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356200/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of coded OQPSK and MIL-STD SOQPSK with iterative decoding","sourcePdf":"01356200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057074S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"29784","articleId":"1356200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356201,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper, a reduced complexity MAP-based iterative MUD based on the use of a soft sensitive bits algorithm is proposed for coded multicarrier code-division multiple-access systems.

The performance of the trellis shaping depends on signal mapping strategy, and the two types of mapping, referred to as Type-I and Type-II, are proposed. The Type-I mapping has no capability of reducing the average power, but it can achieve a significant reduction of the peak-to-average power ratio.

In practice, knowledge of the unknown channel is often obtained by sending known training symbols to the receiver. During the training period, we obtain the best linear unbiased estimates of the channel parameters based on the received training block. We determine the optimal training sequence set that minimizes the mean square error of the channel estimator under a total transmit power constraint. In order to obtain the advantage of the optimal training sequence design, long-term statistics of the interference correlation are needed at the transmitter. Hence, this information needs to be estimated at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter. Obviously it is desirable that only a minimal amount of information needs to be fed back from the receiver to gain the advantage in reducing the estimation error of the short-term channel fading parameters.

The complexity of locating the desired root is further reduced at almost no expense of performance degradation by an alternate algorithm that uses the fact that the solution is related to the root of a special factor of the polynomial. This alternate method is very attractive for its simplicity and excellent performance that, even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), is very close to the corresponding Crame/spl acute/r-Rao lower bound. A detailed analysis of the mean-squared error performance is presented and the analysis is validated by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29784/01356211.pdf","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-assisted maximum-likelihood frequency-offset estimation for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356211/","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-assisted maximum-likelihood frequency-offset estimation for OFDM systems","volume":"52","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184486","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356211/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-assisted maximum-likelihood frequency-offset estimation for OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01356211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077888S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"29784","articleId":"1356211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356212,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The ultimate goal of these schemes is to reduce the envelope fluctuation of ordinary OFDM, while keeping its high spectral efficiency and allowing a low-cost, power-efficient implementation. An appropriate statistical model concerning the transmitted frequency-domain blocks is developed, which is derived from well-established results on Gaussian stochastic processes distorted by memoryless nonlinearities. This model can be employed for performance evaluation by analytical means, with highly accurate results whenever the corresponding conventional OFDM signals exhibit quasi-Gaussian characteristics. Cases where the signal-processing scheme is repeatedly used, in an iterative way, are treated through an extension of the proposed statistical modeling. A set of numerical results is presented and discussed so as to show the practical interest of both the proposed schemes and the analytical methods for evaluation of their performance. For the sake of comparisons, this paper includes numerical results concerning the partial transmit sequence technique, which is an alternative peak-to-mean envelope power ratio-reducing technique of higher complexity, often recommended due to its distortionless nature. The superior performance/complexity tradeoffs through the proposed class of nonlinear signal-processing schemes is emphasized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A class of nonlinear signal-processing schemes for bandwidth-efficient OFDM transmission with low envelope fluctuation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836567","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29784/01356212.pdf","startPage":"2009","endPage":"2018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A class of nonlinear signal-processing schemes for bandwidth-efficient OFDM transmission with low envelope fluctuation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1356212/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184487","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A class of nonlinear signal-processing schemes for bandwidth-efficient OFDM transmission with low envelope fluctuation","sourcePdf":"01356212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09723S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"29784","articleId":"1356212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1356213,"authors":[{"name":"Defeng Huang","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong","Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/29784/1356213/1356213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nDefeng (David) Huang (M'01\u2013S'02) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Kowloon, in 2004.","From 1998 to 2001, he was an Assistant Teacher and later a Lecturer with Tsinghua University.

In this scenario, the optimal approach is subcarrier-based space combining. However, such an approach is quite complex, because multiple discrete Fourier transform (DFT) blocks, each per receive antenna, are used. We propose a pre-DFT processing scheme based upon eigenanalysis. In the proposed scheme, the received signals are weighted and combined both before and after the DFT processing. As a result, the required number of DFT blocks can be significantly reduced. With perfect weighting coefficients, the margin of the performance improvement decreases along with the increase of the number of DFT blocks, thus enabling effective performance and complexity tradeoff. To achieve a maximum average pairwise codeword distance, it will be shown that the maximum number of DFT blocks required is equal to the minimum of the number of receive antennas and the number of distinct paths in the channel. When the number of distinct paths is larger than the number of receive antennas and with a smaller number of DFT blocks, extensive simulation results will also show that near-optimal performance can still be achieved for most channels. Finally, in an OFDM system with differential modulation, we use a signal covariance matrix to obtain the weighting coefficients before the DFT processing. In this case, simulation results will demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheme can be better than subcarrier-based space combining, but with much lower complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-DFT Processing using eigenanalysis for coded OFDM with multiple receive antennas","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836594","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/29784/01356213.pdf","startPage":"2019","endPage":"2027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Pre-DFT Processing using eigenanalysis for coded OFDM with multiple receive antennas","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1356213/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8184488","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-DFT Processing using eigenanalysis for coded OFDM with multiple receive antennas","sourcePdf":"01356213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078918S","chronDate":"Nov.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"29784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"29784","articleId":"1356213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1356225,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["Department of Ocean Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/29785/1356225/1356225-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen Xu (SM'04) received the B.E. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1990, the M.S. degree from the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 2001.","From 1993 to 1996, he was a research engineer with the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Because of the nonlinear parameter-dependence of the signal field, the estimate is subject to ambiguities and the sidelobe contribution often dominates the estimation error below a threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To study the matched-field performance, three Bayesian lower bounds on mean-square error are developed: the Bayesian Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound (BCRB), the Weiss-Weinstein bound (WWB), and the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB). Particularly, for a multiple-frequency, multiple-snapshot random signal model, a closed-form minimum probability of error associated with the likelihood ratio test is derived, which facilitates error analysis in a wide scope of applications. Analysis and example simulations demonstrate that 1) unlike the local CRB, the BCRB is not achieved by the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) even at high SNR if the local performance is not uniform across the prior parameter space; 2) the ZZB gives the closest MLE performance prediction at most SNR levels of practical interest; 3) the ZZB can also be used to determine the necessary number of independent snapshots achieving the asymptotic performance of the MLE at a given SNR; 4) incoherent frequency averaging, which is a popular multitone processing approach, reduces the peak sidelobe error but may not improve the overall performance due to the increased ambiguity baseline; and finally, 5) effects of adding additional parameters (e.g., environmental uncertainty) can be well predicted from the parameter coupling.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.837437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29785/01356225.pdf","startPage":"3293","endPage":"3305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.837437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian bounds for matched-field parameter estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356225/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian bounds for matched-field parameter estimation","volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8211025","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356225/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian bounds for matched-field parameter estimation","sourcePdf":"01356225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096115S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"29785","articleId":"1356225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356226,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A new linear receiver structure is developed to decode the data sent from the transmitter-of-interest while rejecting MAI, self-interference, and noise. The proposed receivers are designed by minimizing the output power subject to constraints that zero-force self-interference and/or preserve a unity gain for all symbols of the transmitter-of-interest.

This paper presents two DASP approaches for spectrum estimation of continuous-time signals. The proposed algorithms, named the weighted sample (WS) and weighted probability (WP) density functions, respectively, utilize random sampling to suppress aliasing. Both methods produce unbiased estimators of the signal spectrum. To achieve this effect, the computational procedure for each method has been suitably matched with the probability density function characterising the pseudorandom generators of the sampling instants. Both proposed methods are analyzed, and the qualities of the estimators they produce have been compared with each other. Although none of the proposed spectrum estimators is universally better than the other one, it has been shown that in practical cases, the WP estimator produces generally smaller errors than those obtained from WS estimation. A practical limitation of the approaches caused by the sampling-instant jitter is also studied. It has been proven that in the presence of jitter, the theoretically infinite bandwidths of WS and WP signal analyses are limited. The maximum frequency up to which these analyses can be performed is inversely proportional to the size of the jitter.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.837436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29785/01356228.pdf","startPage":"3324","endPage":"3334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.837436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral analysis of randomly sampled signals: suppression of aliasing and sampler jitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356228/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral analysis of randomly sampled signals: suppression of aliasing and sampler jitter","volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8211028","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356228/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral analysis of randomly sampled signals: suppression of aliasing and sampler jitter","sourcePdf":"01356228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067257S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"29785","articleId":"1356228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1356230,"authors":[{"name":"B.E.

In spite of its practical success, its theoretical signal analysis has remained limited because a /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator contains of a feedback loop that includes a nonlinear operation, i.e., the amplitude discretization or quantization. The feedback allows us to use oversampling to compensate for the limitations of the quantizer in resolution and in precision, which are typical of analog circuits. However, because of the lack of signal analysis, it is still not clear how much resolution of conversion can be gained as a function of the oversampling. We show that for a large class of /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators, the feedback loop theoretically yields an equivalent feedforward signal flow graph, at least for constant inputs. This is possible thanks to remarkable modulo properties of these modulators. This equivalence can be asymptotically extrapolated to time-varying inputs with increasing oversampling. Although the exact components of the equivalent graph are not currently known in general, the theoretical structure of the feedforward graph is sufficient to point out misconceptions in the current knowledge on the final resolution of an nth-order /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator. Specifically, except when the modulator is \"ideal\", the global resolution of conversion increases by n bits per octave of oversampling, instead of the currently believed rate of n+(1/2) bits/octave.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29785/01356233.pdf","startPage":"3378","endPage":"3393","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.837406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.837406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breaking the feedback loop of a class of /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ A/D converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Breaking the feedback loop of a class of /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ A/D converters","htmlLink":"/document/1356233/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8211033","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breaking the feedback loop of a class of /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ A/D converters","sourcePdf":"01356233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125768S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29785","articleId":"1356233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1356236,"authors":[{"name":"Min Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"p":["Min Han (M'02) was born in Beijing, China, in 1959.

The main purpose of this paper is to study a new methodology to model and predict chaotic time series based on a new recurrent predictor neural network (RPNN). This method realizes long-term prediction by making accurate multistep predictions. This RPNN consists of nonlinearly operated nodes whose outputs are only connected with the inputs of themselves and the latter nodes. The connections may contain multiple branches with time delays. An extended algorithm of self-adaptive back-propagation through time (BPTT) learning algorithm is used to train the RPNN. In simulation, two performance measures [root-mean-square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy (PA)] show that the proposed method is more effective and accurate for multistep prediction. It can identify the systems characteristics quite well and provide a new way to make long-term prediction of the chaotic time series.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.837418","startPage":"3409","endPage":"3416","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29785/01356236.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.837418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of chaotic time series based on the recurrent predictor neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Delay effects","Feedforward systems","Predictive models","Nonlinear equations","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Signal processing algorithms","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series","recurrent neural nets","backpropagation","mean square error methods","signal processing","chaos","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic time series","recurrent predictor neural network","nonlinearly operated nodes","self-adaptive back-propagation through time learning algorithm","root-mean-square error","prediction accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos","prediction","recurrent neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of chaotic time series based on the recurrent predictor neural network","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1356236/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8211036","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of chaotic time series based on the recurrent predictor neural network","sourcePdf":"01356236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095733S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"29785","articleId":"1356236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1356237,"authors":[{"name":"Kuei-Chiang Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/29785/1356237/1356237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuei-Chiang Lai (M'01) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1993 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Engineer with Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, working on the design of wireless modems.

The receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI), while the transmitter has different types of CSI, i.e., either perfect CSI, or no CSI, or long-term knowledge of the channel covariance matrix. For the case in which the transmitter knows the channel covariance matrix, it was recently shown that the optimal eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix correspond with the eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrix. However, the optimal eigenvalues are difficult to compute. We derive a characterization of the optimum power allocation. Furthermore, we apply this result to provide an efficient algorithm which computes the optimum power allocation. In addition to this, we analyze the impact of correlation on the ergodic capacity of the MISO system with different CSI schemes. At first, we justify the belief that equal power allocation is optimal if the transmitter is uninformed and the transmit antennas are correlated. Next, we show that the ergodic capacity with perfect CSI and without CSI at the transmitter is Schur-concave, i.e., the more correlated the transmit antennas are, the less capacity is achievable. In addition, we show that the ergodic capacity with covariance knowledge at the transmitter is Schur-convex with respect to the correlation properties. These results completely characterize the impact of correlation on the ergodic capacity in MISO systems. Furthermore, the capacity loss or gain due to correlation is quantified. For no CSI and perfect CSI at the transmitter, the capacity loss due to correlation is bounded by some small constant, whereas the capacity gain due to correlation grows unbounded with the number of transmit antennas in the case in which transmitter knows the channel covariance matrix. Finally, we illustrate all theoretical results by numerical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/29785/01356239.pdf","startPage":"3440","endPage":"3453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2004.837415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2004.837415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal transmission strategies and impact of correlation in multiantenna systems with different types of channel state information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Transmitters","Covariance matrix","Transmitting antennas","Feedback","Wireless communication","Fading","Mutual information","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","radio links","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","transmitting antennas","telecommunication channels","radio transmitters","radio receivers","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmission strategy","multiantenna system","channel state information","multiple-input single-output wireless communication link","channel covariance matrix","optimal eigenvector","optimum power allocation","MISO system","transmitting antenna","Schur-concave"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","capacity","channel state information","covariance feedback","multiple-antenna systyems","power allocation","spatial correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Optimal transmission strategies and impact of correlation in multiantenna systems with different types of channel state information","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1356239/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8211039","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal transmission strategies and impact of correlation in multiantenna systems with different types of channel state information","sourcePdf":"01356239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10532S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"29785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"29785","articleId":"1356239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356240,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Biao Chen","id":"37280633800"},{"name":"Ruixiang Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Ruixiang Jiang","id":"37269405200"},{"name":"T.

To address this issue, two alternative fusion schemes, namely, the maximum ratio combining statistic and a two-stage approach using the Chair-Varshney fusion rule, are proposed that alleviate these requirements and are shown to be the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equivalents of the likelihood-based fusion rule.

The voltage signal under investigation is often corrupted by noises, therefore the signal is first de-noised and then wavelet transform is applied. Using the first detail wavelet coefficients, voltage disturbance is detected and its duration is determined. The voltage disturbance is classified using the approximation wavelet coefficients. To test developed scheme, diverse data obtained from MATLAB for different types of transient disturbances, voltage sags, voltage swells, short time interruptions, and voltage dips are employed. Simulation results show that the proposed method is fast and accurate.

Based on Si, it showed some remarkable properties. However, it failed to meet the technology requirements in terms of on-current and threshold voltage. Improvement in the n-channel device performance by bandgap modulation at the tunneling junction using a thin /spl delta/p/sup +/ SiGe layer has been shown. However, as the germanium mole fraction is increased in SiGe, even though the on-current threshold voltage and sub-threshold swing, S, all show improved behavior, the leakage current is seen to increase significantly as tunneling probability becomes significant even at zero gate bias. In this work, we further present the improvement in the device performance using gate workfunction engineering along with bandgap modulation at the tunnel junction. As bandgap modulation leads to improved S and can be scaled to below 60 mV/dec independent of temperature we show, by means of 2D computer simulations, that it is possible to achieve very low off-currents and very high on-currents for the tunnel FET.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8169988","htmlLink":"/document/1356534/","conferenceDate":"23-23 Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Vertical tunnel field-effect transistor with bandgap modulation and workfunction engineering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vertical tunnel field-effect transistor with bandgap modulation and workfunction engineering","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"01356534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048009S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9370","isNumber":"29754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9370","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"29754","articleId":"1356534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1356538,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper deals with wirebond and metallization degradation of integrated vertical DMOS switches that are stressed with periodic power dissipation pulses under laboratory conditions. The test setup is briefly described as well as the test results. Physical failure analysis proves that migration phenomena in the power metallization, as well as bond wire delamination, play a crucial role in device aging. A model of time to failure is derived from measured data. It implies that thermomechanical as well as electrical mechanisms contribute to final device failure. Several hypotheses are discussed, showing that the wirebond-metallization interface is most probably the weak point of power switch robustness.

We have found that RCAT-ASC shows much better device performance than the normal RCAT-SC (recessed channel array transistor with symmetric channel doping scheme) or PCAT-ASC (planar channel array transistor with asymmetric channel doping scheme). The RCAT-ASC has the lowest junction leakage currents at storage nodes among them. The increase of data retention time is found to be very remarkable, and thus we suggest that the RCAT-ASC should be an effective method for longer data retention time of DRAM for the future generations. Additionally, we also found that the charge sharing time (tCS) of RCAT-ASC has the lowest values among the three array transistor schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDER.2004.1356588","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th European Solid-State Circuits Conference (IEEE Cat.

Experimental results show that the use of advanced circuit techniques, which enable charge recycling and intermediate precharge voltages, saves 20% in power consumption and 63% in peak supply current and that the logic style preserves the energy masking behavior of the sense amplifier based logic.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIR.2004.1356647","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/9372/29756/01356647.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"182","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIR.2004.1356647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge recycling sense amplifier based logic: securing low power security ICs against DPA [differential power analysis]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Charge recycling sense amplifier based logic: securing low power security ICs against DPA [differential power analysis]","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-23 Sept. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1356647/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8162217","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356647/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge recycling sense amplifier based logic: securing low power security ICs against DPA [differential power analysis]","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"01356647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040549S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9372","isNumber":"29756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9372","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"29756","articleId":"1356647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1356651,"authors":[{"name":"J. van Sinderen","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"J.","lastName":"van Sinderen","id":"37268647500"},{"name":"M.

We conclude that intrinsic parameter fluctuations will become a major limitation to further conventional MOSFET SRAM scaling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356657/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356657/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8162226","conferenceDate":"23-23 Sept. 2004","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The impact of random doping effects on CMOS SRAM cell","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of random doping effects on CMOS SRAM cell","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"01356657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058193S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9372","isNumber":"29756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9372","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"29756","articleId":"1356657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356662,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Cryptographic security gets compromised if the current waveforms so obtained correlate with those from a hypothetical power model of the circuit. Such correlations can be minimized by masking datapath operations with random bits in a reversible way. We analyze such countermeasures and discuss how they perform and how well they lend themselves to being incorporated into dedicated hardware implementations of the advanced encryption standard (AES) block cipher. Our favorite masking scheme entails a performance penalty of some 40-50%.

Hopfield neural network is used in this work to find the optimal configuration of location areas in a mobile network. Toward this end, the location areas configuration of the network is modeled so that the mobility management cost of the system is related to the energy value of this artificial neural network. Since a pure Hopfield neural network was not efficient enough to be used in solving this problem, some modifications applied to it to make it a reasonable approach. Basically, these modifications deal with randomness of selection in manipulating the cells during the solving process. Simulation results are very promising and they lead to network configurations that are unexpected.","doi":"10.1109/PERSER.2004.1356786","startPage":"141","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"The IEEE/ACS International Conference onPervasive Services, 2004.

This new paradigm augments a sensor network with a very limited wired infrastructure to improve its overall energy-efficiency. Energy-efficiency is obtained by reduction in average path length. We have developed an analytical model to analyze the gain in path length reduction by using short cuts. We have also conducted extensive simulations to validate our analysis. Our results show that there is an optimal wire length for which the path length reduction is at its maximum, beyond which it decreases. The optimal length is only a small fraction (3 7.8-50%) of the network diameter. In a network with 1000 nodes uniformly distributed on a disk the path length reduction saturates at 60-70% with 5-24 wires, depending on the location of the sink. Also, we find that restricting the knowledge about the wires to 2 hops does not degrade the performance from the case when we have global knowledge of all wires. These results show promise of the new paradigm.","doi":"10.1109/PERSER.2004.1356794","pdfPath":"/iel5/9379/29787/01356794.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"177","displayPublicationTitle":"The IEEE/ACS International Conference onPervasive Services, 2004.

Currently, this is possible only by using multiple wireless network cards in the device. Unfortunately, using multiple wireless cards causes excessive energy drain and consequent reduction of lifetime in battery operated devices. We propose a software based approach, called MultiNet, that facilitates simultaneous connections to multiple networks by virtualizing a single wireless card. The wireless card is virtualized by introducing an intermediate layer below IP, which continuously switches the card across multiple networks. The goal of the switching algorithm is to he transparent to the user who sees her machine as being connected to multiple networks. We present the design, implementation, and performance of the MultiNet system. We analyze and evaluate buffering and switching algorithms in terms of delay and energy consumption. Our system is agnostic of the upper layer protocols, and works well over popular IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN cards.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01356976.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"893 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356976","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356976","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356976","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Protocols","Wireless LAN","Switches","Wireless networks","Delay","Packet switching","Traffic control","Computer science","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless LAN","telecommunication switching","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single wireless card","multiple wireless network cards","battery operated devices","switching algorithm","MultiNet system","wireless LAN cards"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356976/","displayDocTitle":"MultiNet: connecting to multiple IEEE 802.11 networks using a single wireless card","accessionNumber":"8243981","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1356976/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","volume":"2","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MultiNet: connecting to multiple IEEE 802.11 networks using a single wireless card","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01356976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048799S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1356976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1356978,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We conduct a one-month measurement study of locality phenomena among wireless Web users and their association patterns on a major university campus using the IEEE 802.11 wireless infrastructure. We evaluate the performance of different caching paradigms, such as single user cache, cache attached to an access point (AP), and peer-to-peer caching. In several settings such caching mechanisms could be beneficial. Unlike other measurement studies in wired networks in which 25% to 40% of documents draw 70% of Web access, our traces indicate that 13% of unique URLS draws this number of Web accesses. In addition, the overall ideal hit ratio of the user cache, cache attached to an access point, and peer-to-peer caching paradigms (where peers are coresident within an AP) are 51%, 55%, and 23%, respectively. We distinguish wireless clients based on their inter-building mobility, their visits to APs, their continuous walks in the wireless infrastructure, and their wireless information access during these periods. We model the associations as a Markov chain using as state information the most recent AP visits. We can predict with high probability (86%) the next AP with which a wireless client will associate. Also, there are APs with a high percentage of user revisits. Such measurements can benefit protocols and algorithms that aim to improve the performance of the wireless infrastructures by load balancing, admission control, and resource reservation across APs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information analysis","Pattern analysis","Peer to peer computing","Wireless networks","Internet","Delay","Prefetching","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols","Cooperative caching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio access networks","Internet","client-server systems","Markov processes","cache storage","peer-to-peer computing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless information locality","coverage planning","resource reservation","wireless Web users","major university campus","single user cache","peer-to-peer caching","wireless clients","wireless information access","Markov chain","wireless association patterns"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356978","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01356978.pdf","startPage":"906","endPage":"917 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of wireless information locality and association patterns in a campus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of wireless information locality and association patterns in a campus","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356978/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356978/","accessionNumber":"8221436","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of wireless information locality and association patterns in a campus","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01356978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054942S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1356978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1356979,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A content-based network is a communication network that features a new advanced communication model where messages are not given explicit destination addresses, and where the destinations of a message are determined by matching the content of the message against selection predicates declared by nodes. Routing in a content-based network amounts to propagating predicates and the necessary topological information in order to maintain loop-free and possibly minimal forwarding paths for messages. The routing scheme we propose uses a combination of a traditional broadcast protocol and a content-based routing protocol. We present the combined scheme and its requirements over the broadcast protocol. We then detail the content-based routing protocol, highlighting a set of optimization heuristics. We also present the results of our evaluation, showing that this routing scheme is effective and scalable.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01356979.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"928 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A routing scheme for content-based networking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Routing protocols","Computer science","Condition monitoring","Intrusion detection","Games","Network synthesis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network topology","routing protocols","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based networking","routing scheme","traditional broadcast protocol","content-based routing protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"A routing scheme for content-based networking","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1356979/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8243982","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A routing scheme for content-based networking","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01356979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052552S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1356979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1356987,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We propose two location algorithms, selective fusion location estimation (SELFLOC) and region of confidence (RoC), which can be used in conjunction with classical location algorithms such as triangulation, or with third-party commercial location estimation systems. The SELFLOC algorithm infers the user location by selectively fusing location information from multiple wireless technologies and/or multiple classical location algorithms in a theoretically optimal manner. The RoC algorithm attempts to overcome the problem of aliasing in the signal domain, where different physical locations have similar RF characteristics, which is particularly acute when users are mobile. We have empirically validated the proposed algorithms using wireless LAN and Bluetooth technology. Our experimental results show that applying SELFLOC for stationary users when using multiple wireless technologies and multiple classical location algorithms can improve location accuracy significantly, with mean distance errors as low as 1.6 m. For mobile users we find that using RoC can allow us to obtain mean errors as low as 3.7 m. Both algorithms can be used in conjunction with a commercial location estimation system and improve its accuracy further.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01356990.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1043 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1356990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust indoor location estimation of stationary and mobile users","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Radio frequency","Wireless LAN","RF signals","Local area networks","Bluetooth","Global Positioning System","Calibration","Mobile communication","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","wireless LAN","Bluetooth","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust indoor location estimation","mobile user","heterogeneous indoor RF technology","selective fusion location estimation","region of confidence","third-party commercial location estimation system","SELFLOC algorithm","multiple wireless technology","multiple classical location algorithm","RoC algorithm","wireless LAN","local area network","Bluetooth technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Robust indoor location estimation of stationary and mobile users","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1356990/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8243992","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust indoor location estimation of stationary and mobile users","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"1356990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077358S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1356990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1356991,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A common objective is to maximize throughput performance of a network or to minimize the total transmission power while satisfying quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. The achievement of these objectives requires the development of medium access control (MAC) strategies that optimally utilize scarce resources in wireless networks. When developing such strategies, a good understanding of the structure of the feasibility region is essential. The feasibility region is defined as a set of all QoS requirements that can he supported by a network with all users active concurrently. Thus, the structure of this set shows when (if at all) scheduling strategies can improve network performance. In particular, if the feasibility region is a convex set, then concurrent transmission strategies are optimal and the optimal power allocation can be obtained efficiently via a convex optimization. Other important problems are how the total transmission power depends on QoS requirements and what the optimal QoS tradeoff is. In this paper, we address all these problems and solve them completely in some important cases. The purpose of this paper is to explore the interrelationship between QoS requirements and physical quantities such as transmission power. Although the results are obtained in the context of a power-controlled CDMA system, they also apply to some other communications systems. A key assumption is that there is a monotonous relationship between a QoS parameter of interest (such as data rate) and the signal-to-interference ratio at the output of a linear receiver.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356994","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01356994.pdf","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1088 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal QoS tradeoff and power control in CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1356994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal QoS tradeoff and power control in CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8243996","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1356994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal QoS tradeoff and power control in CDMA systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01356994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087227S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1356994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1357006,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-Hua Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Guang-Hua Yang","id":"37276271500"},{"name":"Dongxu Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dongxu Shen","id":"37279368600"},{"name":"V.O.K.

In such a scheme, video data is partitioned into high-priority (HP) and low-priority (LP) layers according to the importance of the data. At the receiver side, OFDM sub-channels are partitioned into high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) groups according to the estimated channel qualities. Based on the feedback of sub-channel partitioning results, the transmitter assigns HP and LP video data to the corresponding HQ and LQ sub-channels. Through theoretical analysis, we show there is indeed a significant BER difference between the HQ and LQ sub-channels, which can be exploited by UEP. Based on the analysis, we provide a criterion for determining the appropriate transmission power. Through computer simulations, we show that the proposed scheme offers significant performance gain compared to conventional methods. We also demonstrate that the scheme is the least sensitive to channel estimation errors among all compared schemes, and is hardly influenced by the Doppler spread. The feedback overhead can also be reduced with almost no performance penalty by bundling several neighboring sub-channels together and assigning them to the same group.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357006","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01357006.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1210 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UEP for video transmission in space-time coded OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1357006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1357006/","displayDocTitle":"UEP for video transmission in space-time coded OFDM systems","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1357006/","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UEP for video transmission in space-time coded OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01357006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112393S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1357006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1357007,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The basic design is a replacement for a transparent bridge and makes no assumption about higher layer protocols. It involves creating an infrastructure of switches (which we call Rbridges, for \"routing bridges\") in which packets are routed, although, as with bridges, layer 2 end code location is learned through receipt of data packets. It avoids the disadvantages of bridges, since packets within the infrastructure need not be confined to a spanning tree, and packets are protected with a hop count and not proliferated while in transit, so there is no need for any artificial startup delay on ports to avoid temporary loops. This allows IP nodes to travel within a multi-link campus without changing IP addresses. The paper introduces further optimizations for IP, such as avoiding hooding ARP messages through the infrastructure, and (for IP nodes), allowing Rbridges to avoid learning on data packets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1357007/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"8244009","publicationDate":"2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1357007/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rbridges: transparent routing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rbridges: transparent routing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"1357007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060512S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1357007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1357014,"authors":[{"name":"Zuyuan Fang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zuyuan Fang","id":"37087306470"},{"name":"B.

It presents some applications to show how such a framework can be invoked to design efficient media access control protocols in a noncooperative, self-organized, topology-blind environment as well as in environments where the competing nodes share some basic information to guide their choice of channel access policies. For this purpose, contentions between concurrent links in a MANET are represented by a conflict graph, and each maximal clique in the graph defines a contention context which in turn imposes a constraint on the share of bandwidth that the links in the clique can obtain. Using this approach the fair bandwidth allocation problem is modeled as a general utility based constrained maximization problem, called the system problem, which is shown to admit a unique solution that can only be obtained when global coordination between all links is possible. By using Lagrange relaxation and duality theory, both a non-cooperative and a cooperative game formulation of the problem are derived. The corresponding mathematical algorithms to solve the two games are also provided where there is no need for global information. Implementation issues of the algorithms are also considered. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1357014/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","volume":"2","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8244016","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1357014/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"Fair bandwidth sharing algorithms based on game theory frameworks for wireless ad-hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair bandwidth sharing algorithms based on game theory frameworks for wireless ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01357014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06586S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1357014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1357025,"authors":[{"name":"O.

As a result, many location predictors have been proposed in the literature, though few have been evaluated with empirical evidence. This paper reports on the results of the first extensive empirical evaluation of location predictors, using a two-year trace of the mobility patterns of over 6,000 users on Dartmouth's campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network. We implemented and compared the prediction accuracy of several location predictors drawn from two major families of domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based and compression-based predictors. We found that low-order Markov predictors performed as well or better than the more complex and more space-consuming compression-based predictors. Predictors of both families fail to make a prediction when the recent context has not been previously seen. To overcome this drawback, we added a simple fallback feature to each predictor and found that it significantly enhanced its accuracy in exchange for modest effort. Thus the Order-2 Markov predictor with fallback was the best predictor we studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72% for users with long trace lengths. We also investigated a simplification of the Markov predictors, where the prediction is based not on the most frequently seen context in the past, but the most recent, resulting in significant space and computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with this recency semantics can rival the accuracy of standard Markov predictors in some cases. Finally, we considered several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as smarter tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered that they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with a discussion and suggestions for further work.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357026","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01357026.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1424 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating location predictors with extensive Wi-Fi mobility data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1357026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating location predictors with extensive Wi-Fi mobility data","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1357026/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244027","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1357026/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating location predictors with extensive Wi-Fi mobility data","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01357026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075243S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1357026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1357029,"authors":[{"name":"U.C.

Energy efficiency and connection quality depend on mechanisms that span several communication layers due to the existing co-channel interference among competing flows that must reuse the limited radio spectrum. Although independent consideration of these layers simplifies the system design, it is often insufficient for wireless networks when the overall system performance is examined carefully. The multi-hop wireless extensions and the need for routing users' sessions from source to the destination only intensify this point of view. In this work, we present a framework for cross-layer design towards energy-efficient communication. Our approach is characterized by a synergy between the physical and the medium access control (MAC) layers with a view towards inclusion of higher layers as well. More specifically, we address the joint problem of power control and scheduling with the objective of minimizing the total transmit power subject to the end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees for sessions in terms of their bandwidth and bit error rate guarantees. Bearing to the NP-hardness of this combinatorial optimization problem, we propose our heuristic solutions that follow greedy approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01357029.pdf","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1456 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1357029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for cross-layer design of energy-efficient communication with QoS provisioning in multi-hop wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Energy efficiency","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Quality of service","Interchannel interference","System performance","Routing","Media Access Protocol","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cochannel interference","access protocols","power control","scheduling","quality of service","error statistics","telecommunication control","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient communication","QoS provisioning","multihop wireless network","cochannel interference","medium access control","power control","scheduling","quality of service","bit error rate","NP-hardness","combinatorial optimization problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1357029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","displayDocTitle":"A framework for cross-layer design of energy-efficient communication with QoS provisioning in multi-hop wireless networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1357029/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244030","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for cross-layer design of energy-efficient communication with QoS provisioning in multi-hop wireless networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01357029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112107S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1357029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1357030,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The simplest problem is one where a given source node wants to communicate with a given destination, with a given rate over a multi-hop wireless network, using minimum power. Here the power refers to the total amount of power consumed over the entire network in order to achieve this rate between the source and the destination. There are three decisions that have to be made (jointly) in order to minimize the power requirement. (1) The path(s) that the data has to take between the source and the destination. (Routing). (2) The power with each link transmission is done. (Power Control). (3) Depending on the interference or the MAC characteristics, the time slots in which specific link transmissions have to take place. (Scheduling). (4) To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to derive a performance guaranteed polynomial time approximation algorithm for jointly solving these three problems. We formulate the overall problem as an optimization problem with non-linear objective function and non-linear constraints. We then derive a polynomial time 3-approximation algorithm to solve this problem. We also present a simple version of the algorithm, with the same performance bound, which involves solving only shortest path problems and which is quite efficient in practice. Our approach readily extends to the case where there are multiple source-destination pairs that have to communicate simultaneously over the multi-hop network.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357030","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2004","pdfPath":"/iel5/9369/29790/01357030.pdf","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1466 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1357030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On power efficient communication over multi-hop wireless networks: joint routing, scheduling and power control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1357030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 March 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1357030/","displayDocTitle":"On power efficient communication over multi-hop wireless networks: joint routing, scheduling and power control","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8244031","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1357030/","conferenceDate":"7-11 March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On power efficient communication over multi-hop wireless networks: joint routing, scheduling and power control","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01357030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054753S","chronDate":"7-11 March 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9369","isNumber":"29790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9369","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"29790","articleId":"1357030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1357058,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The performance of different antenna array architectures such as diversity and beamforming arrays is critically dependant on the spatial correlation between antenna elements. We examine the effect of different angular distributions of an arriving signal on the spatial fading correlation between antenna elements of a uniform linear array (ULA). Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the effect of angle of arrival (AOA) distribution on the mean bit error rate (BER) performance of a code division multiple access (CDMA) system employing a ULA at the base station (BS). The results show that the spatial correlation and BER are mainly dependent on the value of angular spread (i.e. the standard deviation of the underlying azimuth energy distribution) and not on the type of the assumed energy distribution.","doi":"10.1109/MIKON.2004.1357074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIKON.2004.1357074","startPage":"493","endPage":"496 Vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Microwaves, Radar and Wireless Communications (IEEE Cat.

Reduced system (a macromodel) captures the singularity frequency behavior using a limited number of variables and is incorporated into the finite difference time domain routine as an iterative leap-frog scheme. Unlike subgridding this approach gives a high spatial resolution at a cost slightly shorter time step. Moreover, it allows one to analyze filters having strong field singularities accurately at the numerical cost comparable to that of the standard FDTD scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Microwaves, Radar and Wireless Communications (IEEE Cat.

The analysis of articulated motion is challenging because of the potentially large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) of an articulated body. For particle filter based algorithms, the number of samples required with high dimensional problems can be computationally prohibitive. To alleviate this problem, we represent the articulated object as an undirected graphical model (or Markov random field, MRF) in which soft constraints between adjacent subparts are captured by conditional probability distributions. The graphical model is extended across time frames to implement a tracker. The tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a belief inference procedure on a dynamic Bayesian network. The discretisation of the state vectors makes it possible to utilise the efficient belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF) algorithms to reason in this network. Experiments on real video sequences demonstrate that the proposed method is computationally efficient and performs well in tracking the human body.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Video sequences","Graphical models","Inference algorithms","Tracking","Motion analysis","Particle filters","Markov random fields","Subspace constraints","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","target tracking","image sequences","motion estimation","Markov processes","statistical distributions","inference mechanisms","belief networks","belief maintenance","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D articulated tracking","dynamic Bayesian networks","motion tracking","articulated structure","video sequence","particle filter-based algorithms","high dimensional problems","undirected graphical model","Markov random field","conditional probability distributions","belief inference procedure","state vector discretisation","belief propagation","mean field algorithms","human body"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIT.2004.1357185","publicationTitle":"The Fourth International Conference onComputer and Information Technology, 2004.

The system has two main sections namely, feature extraction and recognition. The feature extraction is carried out using RTSI (rotation, translation, and scale invariant) features. The main advantage of this feature vector is that it doesn't require the normalization of character. These features are very simple to implement as compared to other methods. The fuzzy min-max neural network (FMNN) is used in the recognition phase. The four dimensional RTSI feature vector consists of normalized moment of inertia, centroid length ratio, centroid sum, and normalized centroid sum. The character recognition systems is tested on 26 uppercase typed English capital letters with various fonts such as Ariel Unicode, Ariel Narrow, Microsoft scan serif and hand written characters.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2004.1357190","startPage":"159","endPage":"164","displayPublicationTitle":"The Fourth International Conference onComputer and Information Technology, 2004.

In a task such as face recognition, important information may be contained in the high-order relationship among pixels. ICA is sensitive to high-order statistic in the data and finds not-necessarily orthogonal bases, so it may better identify and reconstruct high-dimensional face image data. ICA algorithms are time-consuming and sometimes converge difficultly. So a modified FastICA algorithm is developed in this paper, which only need to computer Jacobian matrix once time in one iteration and achieves the correspondent effect of Fast-ICA. After obtaining all independent components, a genetic algorithm is introduced to select optimal independent components (ICs). In this paper, ICA is compared with principle component analysis (PCA) based feature extraction method. The experiment results show that modified FastICA algorithm fast convergence speed and genetic algorithm optimize recognition performance. ICA based features extraction method is robust to variations and promising for face recognition.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2004.1357196","startPage":"194","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"The Fourth International Conference onComputer and Information Technology, 2004.

The adaptive MMSE filter is applied to modify the face normals of triangle meshes and then mesh vertex positions are reconstructed in order to satisfy the modified normals. We also compare quantitatively and visually the adaptive MMSE filter to 3D triangle meshes with the conventional and simple Laplacian smoothing and mean and median filtering schemes. The experiments demonstrate that the adaptive MMSE filter applied to triangle meshes with round shapes and low frequency noise outperforms the existing smoothing schemes mentioned above.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2004.1357282","publicationTitle":"The Fourth International Conference onComputer and Information Technology, 2004.

The multicast routing problem is also known as the Steiner tree problem which has been shown to be NP-complete. Previous research works just take delay, delay jitter, loss rate, bandwidth and cost into consideration and not view multicasting ability of router as a constrained factor. Limiting degree of switch or router can save information delivering/copying time and keep load balance. Delay-constrained is a crucial factor in QoS. This paper takes delay and also degree constraints into account and proposes a new multicast routing algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) to construct degree-delay constrained least-cost multicast routing tree (DDCT). Algorithms adopt prufer coding and decoding which is very suitable for crossover and mutation operation and can save runtime, pruning and grafting techniques are employed to adjust node degree and repair tree structure. Two repairing tree structure methods are proposed and named as DDCTI and DDCT2. Simulations were conducted on a random graph to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental result shows proposed algorithms perform well than other similar multicasting algorithm such as CSPT and Wang/spl I.bar/GA.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2004.1357332","pdfPath":"/iel5/9381/29791/01357332.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1038","displayPublicationTitle":"The Fourth International Conference onComputer and Information Technology, 2004.

Using a Web client, users send test programs and a file with the design to a remote laboratory where it is loaded on a real FPGA device. A set of tools for debugging the remote execution of the tests has been developed, using a graphical interface similar to other debugging tools.

In spite of the current extensive use of metrics, if used in isolation metrics are oftentimes too fine grained to quantify comprehensively an investigated design aspect (e.g., distribution of system's intelligence among classes). To help developers and maintainers detect and localize design problems in a system, we propose a novel mechanism - called detection strategy - for formulating metrics-based rules that capture deviations from good design principles and heuristics. Using detection strategies an engineer can directly localize classes or methods affected by a particular design flaw (e.g., God Class), rather than having to infer the real design problem from a large set of abnormal metric values. We have defined such detection strategies for capturing around ten important flaws of object-oriented design found in the literature and validated the approach experimentally on multiple large-scale case-studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection strategies: metrics-based rules for detecting design flaws","publicationTitle":"20th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance, 2004.

The workload in question is homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous workload contains only QoS-demanding jobs (QDJ) or nonQoS jobs (NQJ) while heterogeneous workload is a mix of QDJs and NQJs. The processing platform used is a single cluster or multiple clusters of computers. Two workload allocation strategies (called ORT and OMR) are developed for homogeneous workloads by establishing and numerically solving optimisation equation sets. The ORT strategy achieves the optimised mean response time for homogeneous NQJ workload; while the OMR strategy achieves the optimised mean miss rate for homogeneous QDJ workload. Based on ORT and OMR, a heterogeneous workload allocation strategy is developed to dynamically partition the clusters into two parts. Each part is managed by ORT or OMR to exclusively process NQJs or QDJs. The judicial partitioning achieves an optimised comprehensive performance, which combines the mean response time and the mean miss rate. The effectiveness of these workload allocation techniques is demonstrated through queueing-theoretical analysis as well as through experimental studies. These techniques can be applied to e-business workload management to improve the distribution of different types of requests in clusters of servers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29797","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference onServices Computing, 2004.

It is shown that WiseMAC can provide a significantly lower power consumption for the same delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1358412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 June-1 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8230021","htmlLink":"/document/1358412/","conferenceDate":"28-1 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"WiseMAC: an ultra low power MAC protocol for the downlink of infrastructure wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiseMAC: an ultra low power MAC protocol for the downlink of infrastructure wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Alexandria, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01358412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053115S","chronDate":"28 June-1 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9388","isNumber":"29803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9388","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"29803","articleId":"1358412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1358414,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Therefore, an effective call admission control is urgent for bandwidth allocation with the occurrence of handoff increasing. The main challenges with multiple types of traffic are that each has its own requirements of bandwidth, traffic characteristic, QoS guarantee and handoff rate. Moreover, the computational complexity is another challenge. To meet these challenges, we set up a fictitious stochastic model to study the actual system so as to avoid coping with the complex multiple dimensions stochastic problem. On one hand, it can turn the multiple steps of state transition into single step, which is a necessary condition for ideal birth-death processes. On the other hand, it can provide a simple and effective method to compute a little larger approximation of the call dropping probabilities for multiple services, which facilitate our estimation for the acceptance ratio vector subject to QoS requirement. In addition, the boundary conditions are also considered in order to improve the control precision. Furthermore, a fast numerical method has been found to decrease the computation complexity greatly. As a result, we get an effective multiservices dynamic call admission scheme called EMDCA to adapt for multiple types of services in broadband wireless networks. Numerical results of simulation show that our scheme steadily satisfies the hard constraint on call dropping probability of multiservices while maintaining a high channel throughput.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2004.1358447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29803","startPage":"454","endPage":"459 Vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

For a reasonable performance, conventional training based methods require a larger number of training symbols which reduces system bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, a semiblind channel estimation and tracking technique is proposed for concatenated turbo codes (TC) with space-time and frequency block codes (STFBC) over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels. The paper describes an effective approach to reduce the number of training symbols to half by implementing the Kalman filter (KF) with the constant modulus algorithm (CMA). Computer simulations show good estimation and tracking by the Kalman filter and CMA with only few training symbols (less than 7% of bandwidth efficiency loss) even when signals experience deep fades. The proposed method is shown to obtain fast channel estimation and tracking which is a requirement in fast fading channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiblind estimation of time varying STFBC-OFDM channels using Kalman filter and CMA","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Through simulation, we get the performance of these two adaptive LDPC schemes under different demands of BER, and the comparison between adaptive LDPC and nonadaptive LDPC is also given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1358613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 June-1 July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-1 July 2004","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1358613/","accessionNumber":"8180584","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive LDPC for Rayleigh fading channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive LDPC for Rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"Alexandria, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01358613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054685S","chronDate":"28 June-1 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9388","isNumber":"29799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9388","xplore-issue":"29799","articleId":"1358613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1358614,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This causes inefficient utilization of channelization codes. Hence, how to efficiently manage the resource of channelization codes of OVSF code tree in WCDMA is an important issue and has been studied extensively. Therefore, in this paper we focus on how to assign channelization code efficiently. Additionally, most researches did not consider the analysis of tree state with dynamic traffic load and lack of systematic call admission control (CAC) mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose the Markov decision process (MDP) based analysis to assign channelization codes efficiently. Next, we extend the MDP-based approach as the call admission control mechanism to maximize system revenue while reducing blocking. Numerical results indicate that the proposed MDP approach yields the best fractional reward loss and code blocking reward loss as compare to that of others, including the random, left most, and crowded first schemes, and the MDP-based CAC outperforms the capacity-based CAC significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2004.1358617","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

However, multiple antennas system requires an antenna separation of 510 /spl lambda/ to keep the correlation coefficient below 0.7 for the space diversity, so this may be difficult to implement in a mobile station with high mobility. Recently, the polarization transmit diversity is considered in a mobile station. However, polarization transmit diversity requires twice transmit powers to compare with the conventional transmit diversity, since only vertically polar antenna cannot receive the horizontal signal components. In this paper, we express the cross correlation of each polarization antenna and the cross polarization discrimination (XPD) of multiple polarization antennas with simple model, and we propose a wideband OFDM using Alamouti coded heterogeneous polarization antennas for reducing the previous problem. From the simulated results, the proposed system shows better BER performance than that of the conventional STBC/OFDM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse link performance improvement for an wideband OFDM using Alamouti coded heterogeneous polarization antennas","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Recently, a simple ICI self-cancellation scheme has been proposed to reduce ICI due to frequency offset errors. Despite its 50% throughput loss, it is very effective in cancelling ICI. However, it does not remove the constant phase error, which has a considerable influence on the error performance of the OFDM system depending on the modulation scheme used. We propose new cancellation schemes, namely adjacent conjugate symbol repetition (ASSR) and symmetric conjugate symbol repetition (SCSR), to eliminate this phase error while reducing ICI. The proposed SCSR also eliminates the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance effects completely. Analytical results show that SCSR offers an average carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) gain of 10 dB for the normalized frequency offset of 0.1 over that of conventional scheme. We evaluate the error performance of 16-QAM with various frequency offset and IQ-imbalance impairments and demonstrate SCSR's robustness to these impairments.","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2004.1358623","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

If a multicast tree is recomputed from scratch, it may consume a considerable amount of CPU time and all communication using the multicast tree will be temporarily interrupted. To alleviate these drawbacks we propose a dynamic optimization model that makes use of a previously computed multicast tree (static model) in order to add new egress nodes. Using these two models, our aim is to combine into a single aggregated metric, the following weighting objectives: maximum link utilization, hop count, total bandwidth consumption and total end-to-end delay. Moreover, our proposal solves the traffic split ratio for multiple trees. We compare the dynamic and static multicast routing models using SNOPT solver. The proposed approach can be applied in MPLS networks by allowing explicit routes to be established in multicast events.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1358674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 June-1 July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-1 July 2004","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1358674/","accessionNumber":"8180620","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization scheme for dynamic multicast groups","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization scheme for dynamic multicast groups","confLoc":"Alexandria, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01358674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051143S","chronDate":"28 June-1 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9388","isNumber":"29799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9388","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"29799","articleId":"1358674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1358738,"authors":[{"name":"C.

An array arrangement of the channel increases data bandwidth, while the signal may be degraded by cross talk. In this paper, cross talk is measured and analyzed, and cross talk countermeasures are discussed for the first time. Received signal waveforms by the inductive coupling are measured by embedded voltage detectors on a test chip. The interference-to-signal ratio (ISR) has good agreement between the measurements and calculations from a theoretical model. It is found that cross talk is reduced to being negligibly small at a certain distance. If the channels are arranged at intervals of this distance, ISR is minimized. A technique based on time division multiple access (TDMA) is also proposed to further reduce cross talk.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2004.1358746","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2004 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (IEEE Cat.

Accurate values of critical charge (Q/sub cg/) for failure are calculated for both this mode and the conventional charge-collection-failure (CCF) mode. We identify opposite behaviors of Q/sub cg/ for the CCF and PBF modes with respect to the amount of charge at the storage node (Q/sub node/). The results on critical charge are also used to predict the soft-error rate and the prediction agrees with the results of measurement to within 30%.

In this paper, we show that the measurements of such devices are error-prone and can cause modeling and simulation inaccuracies. Using a CAD-oriented approach, an error-propagation analysis from measurements to a device-model is performed. We find that the errors in measurements affect the simulated values of R/sub n/, NF/sub min/ and B/sub opt/ the least and these parameters need to be calibrated well in any good device model. Values of G/sub opt/ are shown to propagate from measurements and errors are bigger for devices with a large transadmittance (/sub y21/).

The I/O buffer features programmable drive strength, output impedance matching, hot-socketing compliance, and 3.3v tolerance. High-speed performance was achieved using design techniques of differential level-shifters with voltage and temperature compensated current sources, on-chip decoupling capacitors, and floating-well output buffers. In addition, DLLs and programmable phase offset circuits were used to obtain precise timing control. The chip was manufactured on a 90 nm CMOS process.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2004.1358843","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2004 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (IEEE Cat.

CMOS is the technology of choice for complete systems on a chip due to its lower costs and high integration levels. However, in the past it has always been difficult to integrate high efficiency power amplifiers in CMOS. In this paper, we present a new class of operation (parallel A&B) for power amplifiers that improves both their dynamic range and power efficiency. A prototype design of the new amplifier was fabricated in a 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. The measurement results show over 44% PAE and +22 dBm output power. In comparison to a normal class A amplifier, this new design increases the P1dB by over 3 dB and yet reduces DC power consumption by up to 50% in the linear operation range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1358883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-6 Oct. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1358883/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8181040","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS high efficiency +22 dBm linear power amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS high efficiency +22 dBm linear power amplifier","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01358883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046555S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9389","isNumber":"29800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9389","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"29800","articleId":"1358883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1358884,"authors":[{"name":"A.

On the scene over the years as a means to create a tightly coupled high performance system using bare chips attached in a single package, the new embodiment of SIP is targeting handheld computing and communication products which require space minimization. For SIP to be successful requires reaching toward new assembly technologies to enable die thinning and stacking. Stacking the multiple chips needed for the system helps to minimize x-y package dimensions, while thinning minimizes total height, especially when stacking many chips. This paper provides an overview of several SIP approaches, describes the required assembly technologies, the key silicon-package integration challenges, and how these are being brought together to enable increasing performance and function in ever decreasing space.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2004.1358919","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2004.1358919","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2004 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (IEEE Cat.

High-speed mode offers similar power and performance to a traditional routing switch. In low-power mode, power is reduced at the expense of speed. Leakage power is reduced by 36-40% in low-power vs. high-speed mode (on average); dynamic power is reduced by up to 28%. Leakage power in sleep mode is 61% lower than in high-speed mode. The applicability of the new switch is motivated through an analysis of timing slack in industrial FPGA designs. Specifically, we show that a considerable fraction of routing switches may be slowed down (operate in low-power mode), without impacting overall design performance.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2004 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (IEEE Cat.

Hydrogen has been hailed as the key to a clean energy future primarily because it can be produced from a variety of energy sources, it satisfies all energy needs, it is the least polluting, and it is the perfect carrier for solar energy in that it affords solar energy a storage medium. Efforts are underway to transform the global transportation energy economy from one dependent on oil to that based on sustainable hydrogen. The rationale behind these efforts is that hydrocarbon-based automobiles are a significant source of air pollution, while hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles produce effectively zero emissions. Besides the transportation area, fuel cells can also reduce emissions in other applications such as the residential or commercial distributed electricity generation. Hydrogen is the perfect partner for electricity, and together they create an integrated energy system based on distributed power generation and use. A discussion on the sources of hydrogen in the near- and long-term future as well as the cost of hydrogen production is provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2004","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1359020/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8196596","volume":"2","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hydrogen: automotive fuel of the future","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydrogen: automotive fuel of the future","sourcePdf":"01359020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048608S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"8014","isNumber":"29811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8014","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"29811","articleId":"1359020","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1359035,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These structures are built upon a modified Montgomery modular multiplier, where the operations of multiplication and modular reduction are carried out in parallel rather than interleaved as in the traditional Montgomery multiplier. The digit approach has been adopted in this paper. This methodology is based on varying the digit size and the level of pipelining of the structures. This parameterised approach presents the designer with an efficient way of choosing the architecture which suits better the user requirements in terms of speed and area usage, an issue of critical importance to the resources-limited FPGA chips. Furthermore, the global broadcast data lines are avoided by interleaving multiple encryption operations into the same structure, thus making the implementation systolic. The results of implementation in FPGA have shown that the proposed RSA structures outperformed those structures built around the traditional Montgomery multiplier in terms of speed and area usage.","publicationTitle":"The 2nd Annual IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits and Systems, 2004.

In addition, multicontext devices can save space compared to the conventional FPGAs because they store more programming data per area. However, multicontext FPGAs suffer the same long configuration delays as conventional FPGAs, and this limits performance in some situations. To solve that problem, we introduce a new FPGA called PRMC. The PRMC FPGA is an enhanced multicontext design that has partially reconfigurable contexts and additional features to reduce the configuration overhead. As a result, PRMC configures faster than present multicontext FPGAs, while enjoying the same area benefit.

These pilot symbols and the specific multiplexing scheme are known at the receiver and can be exploited for channel estimation, receiver adaptation, and optimal decoding. Even though PAT has been used for many practical reasons, there still remains a need for an optimal design. The theory and methodology for the design of an optimal PAT have emerged, but much still remains unknown. In this article, the author has presented an overview of PAT. A general PAT model is given as well as the review of the common design criteria. The information theoretic and signal processing issues were also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-assisted wireless transmissions: general model, design criteria, and signal processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2004.1359139","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/29810/01359139.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2004.1359139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1359139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-assisted wireless transmissions: general model, design criteria, and signal processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1359139/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"Nov. 2004","accessionNumber":"8187047","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-assisted wireless transmissions: general model, design criteria, and signal processing","sourcePdf":"01359139.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101913S","chronDate":"Nov. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"29810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"324","xplore-issue":"29810","articleId":"1359139","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":1359184,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In CDMA systems, the multiple access interference limits the number of active users and their transmission rates, which in turn limit the system throughput. The resource has low utilization in most time. The error-control coding scheme can correct some transmission errors at the cost of low coding efficiency. Coding scheme tolerates the multiple access interference even when more users are active. With a proper combination of coding scheme and codes allocation, it is possible to admit more users and to achieve higher system throughput. A traffic scheduling algorithm based on this joint design scheme is proposed for constant rate services in OVSF-CDMA systems. In simulation we compare the system throughput of our joint design algorithm with those of two conventional algorithms, the algorithm adapting the codes allocation only and the algorithm adapting the coding scheme only. It shows the joint design algorithm achieves the highest system throughput","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2004.1359337","publicationTitle":"The Ninth International Conference onCommunications Systems, 2004.

The medium access controls (MACs) of the PON systems are either based on cyclic rotation or polling mechanism. However, these MACs have inherited a potential problem; the cycle time (or polling cycle in the polling MACs) increases linearly as the number of attached ONUs scale up, which can be caused by increasing customer numbers. The longer cycle time means that the ONUs have to wait longer before the next transmission window arrives thus contributing to longer packet delays and poorer QoS. In this paper, a new WDM PON system is proposed where multiple wavelength channels are established in both upstream and downstream directions. The MAC applied is based on an adaptive polling mechanism, and can be used as an upgrade solution for PON systems","publicationTitle":"The Ninth International Conference onCommunications Systems, 2004.

There are two carrier phase noise effects in the OFDM receiver. One is the common phase error (CPE) which is caused by the own carrier phase noise, another is the inter carrier interference (ICI) which is caused by the phase noise of all other carriers. The orthogonality of the sub-carriers has been broken due to the ICL So the conventional detection implemented by an FFT and a decision is not the good choice. The optimum detection is based on maximum likelihood sequence estimation. But the computational complexity of the optimum detection depends exponentially on the number of sub-carriers. Multistage detection for OFDM signals is proposed in this paper. The computational complexity of the multistage detection is linear in the number of sub-carriers. The performance of the multistage detection is compared with that of the optimum detection.

The frequency offset in the receiver LO is usually acquired at the beginning of each packet and later tracked in the data demodulation mode.

The wireless channel, along with its many benefits, poses a host of challenges for system designers, due to its time-varying and frequency selective behavior. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) addresses some of these challenges at the physical layer. In this paper, we discuss various issues in a practical implementation of an OFDM based system which supports adaptive modulation. A novel blind scheme for detecting inactive carriers, resulting from water-filling or other adaptive modulation, is proposed and investigated. Extensive simulation of the detection scheme, in an IEEE 802.11a framework, shows it to be robust against changes in code rate, data modulation and water-level. Backward compatibility of the new scheme with existing devices is also discussed and detection of new devices at the system level is suggested and described. Overall, the work in this paper forms the basis for a cross-layer approach to the optimization of wireless networks, in which the physical, link and network layers are adapted to system parameters such as buffer state, traffic statistics, and channel conditions","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2004.1359366","publicationTitle":"The Ninth International Conference onCommunications Systems, 2004.

Moreover, the system design and test are done by the software-defined radio (SDR) approach which is based only on the PC soundcard and Matlabreg software for a minimum-cost implementation of the NDA-DQAM system. In so doing, first, the speech signal is converted into bit stream by the adaptive delta modulation. Then using two differential angles mapped by Gray-coded dibits, a passband 16-DQAM waveform can be generated. It is shown that the 16-DQAM system incurs only about 0.5-dB performance degradation as compared to the coherent 16-QAM system. With the SDR approach, all the system parameters and TX/RX algorithms are embodied in high-level Matlab programs. A free-running T/2-spaced receiver structure is especially used with interpolation-based timing recovery and Costas carrier synchronization. Finally, experimental results are included to show how real-time speech transmission can be readily achieved.

The error performances of such schemes over fast and slow Rayleigh fading channels are derived. It is shown that on fast Rayleigh fading channel, the code effective length and the product distances should be maximized to achieve higher performance gain, while on slow Rayleigh fading channel, the minimum squared Euclidean distance between the pairwise sequences should be maximized.

The consideration of performance and computational complexity of different MIMO system configurations leads to various applications. In this paper, the performance of V-BLAST scheme for coded MC-CDMA system and performance comparison of different MIMO MC-CDMA system configurations such as V-BLAST scheme and punctured STBC scheme have been investigated. The results show that punctured STBC scheme is better than V-BLAST scheme at the same transmitted data rate (same bandwidth efficiency) in terms-of performance and complexity. This is because punctured STBC scheme achieves higher diversity gain without inter-stream interference compared to V-BLAST scheme which has severe inter-stream interference and lower diversity gain. However, the punctured STBC scheme can only work with lower rate channel coding (for puncturing) and STBC coding rate for complex data is less than one for antennas more than two. Hence, it is suitable for inexpensive real-time applications with moderate data rate","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of different MIMO configurations for downlink MC-CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"The Ninth International Conference onCommunications Systems, 2004.

This paper treats an MC-CDMA uplink system over MC-MIMO multipath fading channel. Assuming each uplink data stream is space-time-coded, two MUD structures based on parallel or serial interference cancellation (SIC/PIC) mechanism are presented. Since the accuracy of channel estimator has a determining effect on the receiver performance, a frequency-domain model-based multipath channel estimator is adopted. Based on the famous modified forward-backward linear prediction (MFBLP) method, this estimator can accurately estimate the path delays and attenuations. Computer simulation results are included to illustrate the channel estimation performance, and show that the PIC or SIC multiuser detector using the proposed channel estimator can attain a performance close to the single user bound","displayPublicationTitle":"The Ninth International Conference onCommunications Systems, 2004.

We focus on long haul or metro links spanning several hundred kilometers of single mode fibers with optical amplifiers. Unlike in AWGN channels where the LLR is a scaled version of the received sample, our study shows that in IM/DD optical channels with dominant ASE noise the LLR is approximately proportional to the square root of the received signal. Moreover, although Gaussian modeling of the received samples in optical channels has been shown to be inaccurate (e.g., (G. Bosco, et al., 2003), (Y. Cai, et al., 2003)), in this work we show that the LLR yielded by a SISO front-end decoder can be accurately modeled as a Gaussian random variable. Building on this result, we develop an adaptive decoding scheme for block turbo codes (BTC) in IM/DD optical channels. The predictions of our analysis are verified by computer simulations of the bit error rate (BER) for several BTC.

In this paper, we evaluate by computer simulations which gives a better bit error rate (BER) performance lower SF or multicode operation - when high level modulation is used in addition to error control coding. For a coded system in a frequency selective channel, there is a tradeoff between frequency diversity gain due to the spreading of symbols, coding gain due to better frequency interleaving effect and orthogonality destruction. It is shown that for QPSK, the performance of OFDM (MC-CDMA with SF=1) is almost the same as that of a fully spread MC-CDMA system.

The system capacities for these two multirate access schemes are investigated. A transmit power control is proposed to maintain the link quality and improve the system capacity. Simulation results verified the correctness of the theoretical bit-error-rate (BER) performance expressions derived for MC-CDMA systems using these access schemes. Numerical results show that mc access scheme using orthogonal Gold spreading sequences give the best performance, and its superiority increases when the ratio between the data rates of both service class increases. In case when non-orthogonal Gold codes are used, mc access scheme shows a degrading in the system capacity as compared to VSG, due to the presence of larger self-interference (SI) among the sequences used by each high rate user","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of multicode and variable spreading gain access scheme for multicarrier CDMA systems supporting multirate services with transmit power control","publicationTitle":"The Ninth International Conference onCommunications Systems, 2004.

In this paper, a general method to construct the orthogonal code set using the sequence with ideal two-level autocorrelation is proposed. The maximal length sequence (M-sequence) is taken as an example to generate the modified M-sequence set. The BER performance of the modified M-sequence is evaluated and compared with the CC code and M-sequence using the simulation. The results indicate that the performance of modified M-sequence is comparable to CC code and much better than M-sequence.

The scheme employs the noise masking effect of quantization and the spectral difference of the quantization factors. Spectrum-based variable bit truncation is used to allocate more energy for the computations that affect the low frequency DCT coefficients more. We propose a benchmark driven search mechanism based on energy and distortion weight to find the optimal truncation sets for different quality constraints and quantization tables. They are stored in a look-up table (LUT) for the on-line reconfiguration.

Our architecture consists of a 16-way parallel context formation module and a 3-stage pipelined arithmetic encoder. We reduce power consumption by properly shutting down parts of the circuit. Compared with the known best design, we reduce 17% of the cycle count and reach a level within 5% of the theoretical lower bound.

As a consequence, the within-class scatter matrix is singular and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method cannot be applied directly. This problem is known as the \"small sample size\" problem. In this paper, we propose a new face recognition method called the discriminative common vector method based on a variation of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis for the small sample size case. Two different algorithms are given to extract the discriminative common vectors representing each person in the training set of the face database. One algorithm uses the within-class scatter matrix of the samples in the training set while the other uses the subspace methods and the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to obtain the discriminative common vectors. Then, the discriminative common vectors are used for classification of new faces. The proposed method yields an optimal solution for maximizing the modified Fisher's linear discriminant criterion given in the paper. Our test results show that the discriminative common vector method is superior to other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, efficiency, and numerical stability.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.9","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/29817/01359747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29817","startPage":"4","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative common vectors for face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1359747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative common vectors for face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","accessionNumber":"8237512","pubMedId":"15628264","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1359747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative common vectors for face recognition","sourcePdf":"01359747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160879S","chronDate":"Jan.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"29817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"404","xplore-issue":"29817","articleId":"1359747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1359751,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The general problem of multiframe point correspondence is NP-hard for three or more frames. A polynomial time algorithm for a restriction of this problem is presented and is used as the basis of the proposed greedy algorithm for the general problem. The greedy nature of the proposed algorithm allows it to be used in real-time systems for tracking and surveillance, etc. In addition, the proposed algorithm deals with the problems of occlusion, missed detections, and false positives by using a single noniterative greedy optimization scheme and, hence, reduces the complexity of the overall algorithm as compared to most existing approaches where multiple heuristics are used for the same purpose. While most greedy algorithms for point tracking do not allow the entry and exit of the points from the scene, this is not a limitation for the proposed algorithm. Experiments with real and synthetic data over a wide range of scenarios and system parameters are presented to validate the claims about the performance of the proposed algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Greedy algorithms","Image sequences","Layout","Motion analysis","Particle tracking","Humans","Polynomials","Real time systems","Surveillance","Target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","image sequences","real-time systems","computational complexity","optimisation","polynomials","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noniterative greedy algorithm","multiframe point correspondence","monocular image sequences","NP-hard problems","polynomial time algorithm","optimization","real time systems","occlusion","multiple heuristics","point tracking algorithm","surveillance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Point correspondence","target tracking","motion","occlusion","point trajectory","data association","bipartite graph matching","path cover of directed graph."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Movement","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Subtraction Technique","User-Computer Interface","Video Recording"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/29817/01359751.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A noniterative greedy algorithm for multiframe point correspondence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1359751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A noniterative greedy algorithm for multiframe point correspondence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359751/","volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1359751/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8237516","pubMedId":"15628268","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A noniterative greedy algorithm for multiframe point correspondence","sourcePdf":"01359751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089054S","chronDate":"Jan.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"29817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"29817","articleId":"1359751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":1359757,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.F.

Our analysis of several representative color spaces using the Bayesian classifier with the histogram technique shows that skin segmentation based on color pixel classification is largely unaffected by the choice of the color space. However, segmentation performance degrades when only chrominance channels are used in classification. Furthermore, we find that color quantization can be as low as 64 bins per channel, although higher histogram sizes give better segmentation performance. The Bayesian classifier with the histogram technique and the multilayer perceptron classifier are found to perform better compared to other tested classifiers, including three piecewise linear classifiers, three unimodal Gaussian classifiers, and a Gaussian mixture classifier.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.17","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/29817/01359760.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skin segmentation using color pixel classification: analysis and comparison","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1359760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359760/","displayDocTitle":"Skin segmentation using color pixel classification: analysis and comparison","volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","accessionNumber":"8225660","pubMedId":"15628277","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1359760/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skin segmentation using color pixel classification: analysis and comparison","sourcePdf":"01359760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049136S","chronDate":"Jan.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"29817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"480","xplore-issue":"29817","articleId":"1359760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1359811,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

Continuous grid monitoring should be considered so as to provide safe connections and disconnections from the grid. This letter gives an overview of the methods used for online grid measurement with PV inverters. Emphasis is placed on a method based on the injection of a noncharacteristic harmonic in the grid. Since this injection is regarded as a disturbance for the grid, different issues, i.e., the influence on total harmonic distortion (THD), the accuracy of line impedance measurement and the ENS (German abbreviation of Main Monitoring units with allocated Switching Devices) detection are studied. Laboratory results conducted on an existing PV inverter are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the PV inverter under different grid conditions.

The sensor comprises a circuit for making differential measurements between an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) and a reference FET (REFET). The ISFET has a floating-gate structure and uses the silicon nitride passivation layer as a pH-sensitive insulator. As fabricated, it has a large threshold voltage that is postulated to be caused by a trapped charge on the floating gate. Ultraviolet radiation and bulk-substrate biasing is used to permanently modify the threshold voltage so that the ISFET can be used in a battery-operated circuit. A novel post-processing method using a single layer of photoresist is used to define the sensing areas and to provide robust encapsulation for the chip. The complete circuit, operating from a single 3-V supply, provides an output voltage proportional to pH and can be powered down when not required.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a single-chip pH sensor using a conventional 0.6-/spl mu/m CMOS process","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2004.836849","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/29821/01359828.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2004.836849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1359828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Design of a single-chip pH sensor using a conventional 0.6-/spl mu/m CMOS process","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1359828/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8201672","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a single-chip pH sensor using a conventional 0.6-/spl mu/m CMOS process","sourcePdf":"01359828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081295S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"29821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"29821","articleId":"1359828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1359861,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

Experiment 2 used one of the head and shoulder sequences from Experiment 1 together with a different, high-motion sequence. In both experiments, subjects assessed the audio quality first, followed by the video quality and finally a third test evaluated multimedia quality. The results of these studies found that human subjects integrate audio and video quality together using a multiplicative rule. A regression analysis using the subjective quality test data from each experiment found that: 1) for head and shoulder content, both modalities contribute significantly to the predictive power of the resultant model, although audio quality is weighted slightly higher than video quality and 2) for high-motion content, video quality is weighted significantly higher than audio quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A basic multimedia quality model","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2004.837233","startPage":"806","endPage":"816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2004.837233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/29822/01359861.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1359861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A basic multimedia quality model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1359861/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8202546","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A basic multimedia quality model","sourcePdf":"01359861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059509S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"29822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"29822","articleId":"1359861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1359882,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Feng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Xiao-Feng Wang","id":"37281376300"},{"name":"Y.R.

We verified a wide tolerance of 20% of the bit-slot for time slot alignment between amplitude-shift keying and differential phase-shift keying modulation in the proposed scheme. We also demonstrated wide dynamic range characteristics at the extinction ratio for both 2- and 3-bit/symbol operation, compared to the conventional scheme.

The drive is a modular, four-phase, fault-tolerant system which is designed to meet the specification with a fault in any one of the phases. The motor employed has a permanent-magnet rotor with the magnets arranged in a Halbach array to maximize the air-gap flux density. Exceptionally high electric loadings are obtained by flooding the entire motor with aircraft fuel, which acts as an excellent cooling agent. Theoretical results are compared with test results gained in conditions approaching those found in an aircraft. Tests are carried out on the unfaulted drive and with one of several fault scenarios imposed. The electrical and thermal performance of the drive is assessed, showing how the flooded fuel cooling has excellent performance without introducing significant drag on the rotor.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2004.832074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/29826/01359945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2004.832074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"671","endPage":"678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and testing of a four-phase fault-tolerant permanent-magnet machine for an engine fuel pump","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1359945/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8209645","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and testing of a four-phase fault-tolerant permanent-magnet machine for an engine fuel pump","sourcePdf":"01359945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079957S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"29826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"29826","articleId":"1359945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1359946,"authors":[{"name":"B.C.

In the case of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines, their control system operates to apply a restraining torque to the rotor according to a predetermined curve with respect to the rotor speed. This control system is not based on the power system frequency and there is negligible contribution to the inertia of the power system. A DFIG control system was modified to introduce inertia response to the DFIG wind turbine. Simulations were used to show that with the proposed control system, the DFIG wind turbine can supply considerably greater kinetic energy than a fixed-speed wind turbine.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2004.827712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2004.827712","startPage":"800","endPage":"802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/29826/01359963.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=29826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of the response of doubly fed and fixed-speed induction generator wind turbines to changes in network frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1359963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2004","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the response of doubly fed and fixed-speed induction generator wind turbines to changes in network frequency","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2004","accessionNumber":"8209663","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1359963/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the response of doubly fed and fixed-speed induction generator wind turbines to changes in network frequency","sourcePdf":"01359963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024059S","chronDate":"Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"29826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"443","xplore-issue":"29826","articleId":"1359963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"}]
