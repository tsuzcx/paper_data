The proposed architecture is designed to handle both real-time UDP traffic, and best effort UDP and TCP traffic without the need for the introduction and management of per-flow state information in the network. SWAN supports per-hop and end-to-end control algorithms that primarily rely on the efficient operation of TC/IP protocols. In particular, SWAN uses local rate control for best-effort traffic, and sender-based admission control for real-time UDP traffic. Explicit congestion notification (ECN) is used to dynamically regulate admitted real-time sessions in the face of network dynamics brought on by mobility or traffic overload conditions. SWAN does not require the support of a QoS-capable MAC to deliver service differentiation. Rather, real-time services are built using existing best effort wireless MAC technology. Simulation, analysis, and results from an experimental wireless testbed show that real-time applications experience low and stable delays under various multihop, traffic, and mobility conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul-Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1081755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul-Sep 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/1081755/","accessionNumber":"7472959","displayDocTitle":"Supporting service differentiation for real-time and best-effort traffic in stateless wireless ad hoc networks (SWAN)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting service differentiation for real-time and best-effort traffic in stateless wireless ad hoc networks (SWAN)","sourcePdf":"01081755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076438S","chronDate":"Jul-Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"23367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"23367","articleId":"1081755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1081757,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It recalls the semistatic approach of transport highlighting key parameters of its control and proposes an external analytic model of the mobile physical layer. This approach is adapted to radio resource management in a multiservice environment, accounting for the relationships between the link and the system levels. This paper clearly shows the impact of the rate matching mechanism on the transmission performances at link level for transport channels multiplexed in the uplink. It refines the power index notion useful at the system level as an indicator of resource consumption and transmission quality of the physical data and control channels. Integrating inter- and intramobile multiservice features with performance tables (considering environment influence, channel coding type, etc.) leads to a cost function of the transport format combinations; a valuable toot for the evaluation of the uplink multiservice cellular capacity. Several multiplexing cases are then studied under the joint aspects of quality tuning and resource consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2002.1081757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/23367/01081757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2002.1081757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23367","startPage":"221","endPage":"235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS tuning and resource sharing for UMTS WCDMA multiservice mobile","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1081757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoS tuning and resource sharing for UMTS WCDMA multiservice mobile","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul-Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1081757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul-Sep 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7472961","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/1081757/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS tuning and resource sharing for UMTS WCDMA multiservice mobile","sourcePdf":"01081757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092603S","chronDate":"Jul-Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"23367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"23367","articleId":"1081757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1081925,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A Fourier-series representation of the current, the nonlinear elastance and the voltage is used to obtain exact closed-form solutions. Lossless coupling networks are considered in the theory so that the performance limits obtained will be fundamental to the varactor itself. Additional circuit losses can be added quite simply to find the expected performance in a practical case. Idler currents (currents flowing at frequencies other than the input and output frequencies) are shown to be necessary for multiplication by integers greater than two with abrupt-junction varactors. The effects of these currents are included in the general theory and a particular case, the tripler, is completely solved to demonstrate the procedures involved and to show the performance limits set by varactor and idler losses.

Although many features of the model and the allowable nonlinearities are chosen to conform to basic characteristics of common self-biased oscillator circuits, the basic procedures employed are applicable to a much larger class of nonlinear problems. The system of nonlinear differential equations describing the original model is approximated by a new, more tractable system chosen by the method of Krylov and Bogoliubov. This approximating system is second order and thus amenable to a phase-plane solution. The phase-plane solutions of the approximating system are shown to predict several common modes of self-biased oscillator behavior, including CW oscillation, squegging, amplitude modulation and multimode operation. The results of the theoretical analysis are then shown to be in very close agreement with the actual behavior of an experimental oscillator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a Class of Self-Biased Multimode Oscillators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1963.1082183","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23379/01082183.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1963.1082183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1082183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1082183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1963","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Class of Self-Biased Multimode Oscillators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1963","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Class of Self-Biased Multimode Oscillators","sourcePdf":"01082183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060015S","chronDate":"Sep 1963","isNumber":"23379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1082183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1082199,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Various coupling schemes may be used to convert the one-port to a two-port amplifier. This two-port, in turn, is useful as a lownoise preamplifier feeding a high-gain postamplifier or receiver. The properties of the \"over-all amplifier\" can be calculated from the noise properties of the negative-conductance one-port, the coupling scheme and the properties of the receiver. Four of the most popular coupling schemes are considered in detail and the minimum achievable noise figure for each case, regardless of the receiver, is\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1 + t</tex>\n, where\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</tex>\nis the noise temperature ratio of the negative-conductance one-port. In each case the conditions for minimum noise figure require also that the over-all amplifier be infinitesimally close to the oscillating condition. This suggests the introduction of a stability factor\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</tex>\nwhich approaches zero as the over-all amplifier nears the oscillating condition. Then, when a condition of finite stability (finite positive\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</tex>\n) is imposed, clearcut differences between the different couplng schemes appear and the noise properties of the receiver come into the picture. It is shown that coupling which is restricted to reciprocal networks is definitely inferior to circulator coupling.

The first of the two contributions to this two-variable circuit theory is a necessary and sufficient test of the two-variable reactance property of any given nonzero two-variable real rational expression. The test requires a finite number of arithmetic computations. The second is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the driving-point impedance function for two-variable lossless one-port realizability. The formulation is in terms of the existence of a two-variable polynomial decomposition with certain properties. (A synthesis based on such a formulation would require, at least, the development of techniques of finding the relevant polynomial decomposition, whose existence is assured by network realizability.) An application of each of these results to the transmission linelumped reactance networks, is noted. In connection with the first result, it is observed how the formal replacement of the exponential portions of the driving-point impedance expression, by expressions introducing an independent variable, defines a function of two complex variables with the two-variable reactance property. The first result thus provides a test of a property necessary for drivingpoint impedance realizability using commensurate-delay transmission lines and lumped reactances. The second result provides a realizability formulation (of the type described above) for these networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1964.1082273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23382/01082273.pdf","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Certain Two-Variable Generalizations of Circuit Theory, with Applications to Networks of Transmission Lines and Lumped Reactances","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1964.1082273","startPage":"214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1082273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1964","displayDocTitle":"On Certain Two-Variable Generalizations of Circuit Theory, with Applications to Networks of Transmission Lines and Lumped Reactances","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1082273/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1964","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Certain Two-Variable Generalizations of Circuit Theory, with Applications to Networks of Transmission Lines and Lumped Reactances","sourcePdf":"01082273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027881S","chronDate":"Jun 1964","isNumber":"23382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"100","articleId":"1082273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1082279,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A precision bilateral gate employing gallium arsenide diodes is at the heart of the circuit. Subnanosecond recovery time, low capacitance (<1 pf), and large forward conductance characterize the gate diodes. Switching of the gate is accomplished at about a 12 Mc/sec sampling rate by a fast driver circuit. To prevent excess current drain from the signal source a constant current source is switched in by the driver to dominate charging of the holding capacitor when the difference between the input and held voltages is large. As the input and output signals approach correspondence, RC charging from the signal source predominates. The approximate dual mode operation of the gate permits a piecewise linear analysis applicable to transmission and switching performance. An equivalent block diagram for the sample and hold circuit is developed that contains linear filters and zero memory nonlinear networks. Nonlinear distortion is evaluated for a bandlimited white noise probe. To approach an over-all system performance limited largely by quantizing noise, the sample and hold circuit must be designed to introduce minimum signal impairment. This necessitates switching in less than one nanosecond and maintenance of the held waveform flat to within about one part in 5,000. Achievement of these difficult requirements is assured through careful analysis, design, and embodiment and has been verified by experiment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23383/01082337.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1964.1082337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1964.1082337","startPage":"389","endPage":"395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Precision Sample and Hold Circuit with Subnanosecond Switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1082337/","displayDocTitle":"A Precision Sample and Hold Circuit with Subnanosecond Switching","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Precision Sample and Hold Circuit with Subnanosecond Switching","sourcePdf":"01082337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066474S","chronDate":"Sep 1964","isNumber":"23383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1082337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1082355,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Numerical results for random waveforms having various correlation functions are presented. From these results a quantitative comparison of the merits of each of the interpolation procedures can be made. From a theoretical point of view one set of mathematical results is new, namely, those results associated with the optimum, linear, time-invariant interpolation of a finite number of samples. The analysis of this problem is complicated by the combination of the constraints of time invariance (i.e., the same interpolatory function is used for each sample) and a finite number of samples. Removal of either constraint makes the problem simpler and leads one to known results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Interpolation","Filters","Polynomials","Random processes","Filtering","Random sequences","Sampling methods","Pulse modulation","Lagrangian functions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCT.1965.1082369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23385/01082369.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1965.1082369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods for Recovering a Random Waveform from a Finite Number of Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1082369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Methods for Recovering a Random Waveform from a Finite Number of Samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1082369/","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1965","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods for Recovering a Random Waveform from a Finite Number of Samples","sourcePdf":"01082369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022538S","chronDate":"Mar 1965","isNumber":"23385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1082369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1082379,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is used as a high-resolution radar waveform. The ambiguity function of a burst waveform has a good peak-to-sidelobe ratio along the range axis. But, along the Doppler axis, its peak-to-sidelobe ratio is not nearly as good. A mismatched receiving filter is the logical way to increase the peak-to-sidelobe ratio of the ambiguity function along the Doppler axis. Taylor weighting only suppresses the Doppler sidelobes that are close to the main peak. In this paper, we derive, by the techniques of nonlinear programming, an iterative method for calculating a mismatched filter that is optimum in the following sense. Let an interval\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</tex>\nof the Doppler axis be specified, as well as a desired peak-to-sidelobe ratio W. Then our method will calculate the mismatched filter with optimum signal-to-noise ratio that reduces the Doppler sidelobes to the specified level over the specified interval, if such a filter exists. If such a filter does not exist, then the calculated filter will still tend to suppress the sidelobes over the specified interval of the Doppler axis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1082405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1965","volume":"12","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"An Application of Nonlinear Programming to Mismatched Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Application of Nonlinear Programming to Mismatched Filters","sourcePdf":"01082405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045813S","chronDate":"June  1965","isNumber":"23386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1082405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1082406,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The rules are purely topological and, in contradistinction to some prior work, do not include sign rules dependent upon an arbitrary assignment of labels to nodes, or directions to reciprocal branches. Any term in an expansion corresponds to a subgraph of the network. The subgraphs are \"loop-woods,\" formed by trees comprised of reciprocal branches and disjoint loops which include at least one nonreciprocal branch each.

At the same time, very low input and output immittances are obtained by this arrangement so that the need for additional negative resistance circuits or negative impedance converters (NIC) to neutralize the residual input and output impedances is obviated. Experimental data exhibit evidence of the excellent performance of the circuit as a gyrator, impedance inverter, and isolator over wide ranges of load and, frequencies that are well below the microwave region. From a theoretical analysis of the circuit, design equations are derived and their application demonstrated by actual design of the gyrator circuit to realize specified open-circuit (o.c.) impedance parameters of the two-port network. These equations show how the network parameters can be individually varied; desired values of the gyration resistance are easily obtained by adjusting single passive elements. The gyrator is then cascaded in between two RC two-port networks to realize complex conjugate poles in such a way that the sensitivity of the poles due to variation in the gyration resistance is minimized. Experimental study of the frequency response of the filter and the sensitivity of the poles when the gyration resistance is varied gives very good results in agreement with theory.","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1965.1082448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23387/01082448.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1965.1082448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Realization of a Gyrator Circuit and RC-Gyrator Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1082448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1965","displayDocTitle":"Practical Realization of a Gyrator Circuit and RC-Gyrator Filters","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Realization of a Gyrator Circuit and RC-Gyrator Filters","sourcePdf":"01082448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051842S","chronDate":"Sep 1965","isNumber":"23387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1082448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1082458,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The arrangement described is capable of yielding a fractional gain change which is equal to the product of the fractional deviations in the gains of each of the redundant signal channels. The nominal input-output transmission is maintained, with negligible changes in gain and bandwidth, even with complete failure of one or more (but not all) of the signal channels; this is achieved at the expense of an increase in sensitivity. The sensitivity to large parameter changes can be minimized over an appreciable portion of the amplifier passband by use of the systematic design procedure which is presented.

It deals specifically with extensions of the uniform sampling expansion of Whittaker and Shannon. In general, sampling expansions of the Lagrange interpolation type for bandlimited signals exist for large classes of sampling sequences; however, such expansions are not necessarily stable in the sense that small corruptions in the amplitudes of sample values may not lead to small changes in the reconstructed function. The concept of a stable sampling expansion is defined. Two specific classes of nonuniform stable sampling expansions are considered.

This paper shows that quantization of a digital filter's coefficients in an actual realization can be represented by a \"stray\" transfer function in parallel with the corresponding ideal filter. Also, by making certain statistical assumptions, the statistically expected mean-square difference between the real frequency responses of the actual and ideal filters can be readily evaluated by one short computer program for all widths of quantization. Furthermore, the same computations may be used to evaluate the rms value of output noise due to data quantization and multiplicative rounding errors. Experimental measurements verify the analysis in a practical case. The application of the results to the design of the digital filters is also considered.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1968.1082769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23397/01082769.pdf","endPage":"41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coefficient Accuracy and Digital Filter Response","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1968.1082769","startPage":"31","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1082769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1968","displayDocTitle":"Coefficient Accuracy and Digital Filter Response","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1082769/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1968","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coefficient Accuracy and Digital Filter Response","sourcePdf":"01082769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027024S","chronDate":"Mar 1968","isNumber":"23397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"90","articleId":"1082769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1082794,"authors":[{"name":"Wai-Kai Chen","lastName":"Wai-Kai Chen","id":"37087417306"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9324"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9555"}],"articleNumber":"1082794","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1082794","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed amplifiers","Low pass filters","Impedance","Circuits","Voltage","Passband","Frequency response","Network synthesis","Valves","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Distributed amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"The overall voltage gain function of a distributed amplifier using standard constant-\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</tex>\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LC</tex>\nlow-pass filter sections, with an extra section being inserted anywhere along the plate line, is given.

This paper is concerned with a class of linear time-varying digital filters and the response of such filters with stochastic input signal. It is shown that these filters possess a number of useful properties; the most important of which is the preservation of wide-sense stationarity of stochastic inputs. Such properties can facilitate considerably the analysis of systems incorporating these filters. It is shown that this class is the most general class of time-varying filters that preserve the wide-sense stationarity of the inputs. A subclass of these filters is shown to be periodic and hence can be implemented simply by using parallel connection of time-invariant filters and a rotating switch. The response of these filters to periodic inputs is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1969.1083006","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23404/01083006.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1969.1083006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","startPage":"467","endPage":"471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class of Time-Varying Digital Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1083006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1969","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1969","displayDocTitle":"A Class of Time-Varying Digital Filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083006/","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1969","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of Time-Varying Digital Filters","sourcePdf":"01083006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084181S","chronDate":"Nov 1969","isNumber":"23404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"31","articleId":"1083006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1083021,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The position regarding the high-frequency response is not as clear, and statements in the literature give various fractions of the fundamental carrier frequency as an upper limit to the input-signal bandwidth that can be recovered from the modulated carrier. It is argued here that there is no simple well-defined theoretical upper limit, and that in practical circuits the fundamental carrier frequency may or may not be one of several factors determining the useful bandwidth. The circuit of a novel wide-band dc amplifier, consisting of two synchronized chopper amplifiers operating in parallel, is described. The frequency response of this amplifier is independent of the chopping rate, and its method of operation may help clarify bandwidth limitations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Frequency","Pulse modulation","Choppers","Circuits","Pulse amplifiers","Filters","Broadband amplifiers","Demodulation","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AM","Active networks","Chopper amplifiers","DC amplifiers, carrier-type"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCT.1970.1083116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23407/01083116.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1970.1083116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the bandwidth of carrier-type dc amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1083116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the bandwidth of carrier-type dc amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083116/","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"August 1970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1970","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the bandwidth of carrier-type dc amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01083116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022759S","chronDate":"Aug 1970","isNumber":"23407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1083116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1083133,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Each transistor of the amplifier has been represented by a frequency-dependent model incorporating four nonlinearities. The Volterra series is used as the analysis tool. The primary motivation for this study is that intermodulation distortion is a critical problem in high-frequency long-haul solidstate systems. A computer program that calculates the amplifier intermodulation distortion has been developed. This program can be used to select the optimum bias point of each stage, optimum interstage and feedback networks, and optimum load and source impedances. Good correlation between calculated and measured results was obtained. The closed-form expressions derived show that the feedback is fully effective in reducing the open-loop second-order distortion and that the feedback may not significantly reduce the open-loop third-order distortion, if the \"second-order interaction\" phenomenon is dominant. The second-order interaction is explained in detail in this paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23408/01083157.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1970.1083157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1970.1083157","startPage":"518","endPage":"527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Volterra series to intermodulation distortion analysis of transistor feedback amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083157/","displayDocTitle":"Application of Volterra series to intermodulation distortion analysis of transistor feedback amplifiers","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Volterra series to intermodulation distortion analysis of transistor feedback amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01083157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081217S","chronDate":"Nov 1970","isNumber":"23408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"97","articleId":"1083157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1083160,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The model is completely specified by two strictly monotonically increasing functions: a restoring function f(.) and a dissipation function g(.). Simple procedures are given for constructing these two functions so that the resulting model will simulate a given hysteresis loop exactly. The model is shown to exhibit many important hysteretic properties commonly observed in practice such as the presence of minor loops and an increase in area of the loop with frequency. In the case of an iron-core inductor, the mathematical model is shown to be equivalent to a lumped-circuit model, consisting of a nonlinear inductor in parallel with a nonlinear resistor. Extensive experimental investigations using different types of cores show remarkable agreement between results predicted by the model with those actually measured. The most serious limitation of this dynamic model is its inability to predict dc behaviors. For the class of switching circuits where dc solutions are important, a special dc lumped-circuit model is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1970","publicationDate":"November 1970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"17","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lumped-circuit models for nonlinear inductors exhibiting hysteresis loops","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lumped-circuit models for nonlinear inductors exhibiting hysteresis loops","sourcePdf":"01083192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041584S","chronDate":"Nov 1970","isNumber":"23408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"110","articleId":"1083192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1083196,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The present paper extends and combines these algorithms to integrated circuit amplifiers, where the ability to \"grow\" transistors to attain specified design goals is mandatory. In particular, it is shown that under the reasonable assumption that certain fabrication parameters are held fixed, suitable design parameters for transistors are the area and the perimeter of the emitter and the dc collector current. Transistor models can be derived in terms of these parameters. The rather general ac-dc design algorithm described allows transistors to grow to meet ac specifications; dc design requirements arise naturally. Two examples are used to show the tractability of the approach: 1 ) a differential pair of transistors is designed for given ac and dc specifications; 2) a cascade amplifier is designed for specified gain, bandwidth, and input and output impedances. The latter example requires the growth of common-base and common-collector transistors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1971","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"January 1971","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Automated AC and DC Design Linear Integrated Circuit Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Automated AC and DC Design Linear Integrated Circuit Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01083216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027707S","chronDate":"Jan 1971","isNumber":"23409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1083216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1083217,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The information provided by large-change sensitivities and performance contours is applicable in the phase of design after an acceptable nominal design has been found.

This leads to an integral transform, formally similar to the Fourier transform, where the signal taken up to the observation time appears weighted by a function (namely, the complex envelope) depending on the frequency of analysis. Of course, for every choice of such a complex envelope (or of the equivalent set of filters), one has a corresponding integral transform to deal with. The particular case of complex envelopes as functions of the time-frequency product is studied here because of its great physical interest (it applies, for instance, to many existing \"real-time audio analyzers\"). The corresponding integral transform is shown to have two remarkable properties: 1) it admits an inverse integral transform; 2) it is \"form invariant\" under linear time scaling of the signal, and no other integral transform (that is, no other class of complex envelopes, even frequency independent) shares this property. The physical significance of such results is discussed, together with some ideas for applications and further theoretical work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1971","publicationDate":"July 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"18","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A contribution to the theory of short-time spectral analysis with nonuniform bandwidth filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contribution to the theory of short-time spectral analysis with nonuniform bandwidth filters","sourcePdf":"01083298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035698S","chronDate":"Jul 1971","isNumber":"23412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1083298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1083302,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This result complements some of the writers' previous work in which attention was not focused on networks containing only independent sources of the voltage type. In fact it was shown by simple examples given earlier that there exist transistor networks (containing ideal independent current sources) for which the network equations have no solution. Here we also complete a study of conditions under which it is possible to carry out certain implicit numerical integration algorithms for the computation of the transient response of an important class of nonlinear networks containing transistors and diodes.

The function in question concerns the translation between the traditional analog frequency division multiplex (FDM) format and the newer digital time division multiplex (TDM) format. This paper describes the design of the digital filters for such a translating device and discusses some of the problems encountered in the hardware realization of these filters. In particular, a concise relationship is developed between the amount of digital filter hardware required and the sample rate, clock (bit) rate, data word length, number of channels being multiplexed, and order of the filter. This relationship is then used as the basis of comparison between various methods of accomplishing the desired function.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Frequency division multiplexing","Hardware","Channel bank filters","Telephony","Digital integrated circuits","Phase change materials","Time division multiplexing","Band pass filters","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP","Digital filters","Digital networks","Digital signal processing (DSP)","Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)","Multiplexing","TDM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCT.1971.1083369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23414/01083369.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1971.1083369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of digital filters for an all digital frequency division multiplex-time division multiplex translator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1083369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of digital filters for an all digital frequency division multiplex-time division multiplex translator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083369/","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"November 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1971","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of digital filters for an all digital frequency division multiplex-time division multiplex translator","sourcePdf":"01083369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033298S","chronDate":"Nov 1971","isNumber":"23414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"49","articleId":"1083369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1083373,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It has been the common practice to compare these networks with regard to passive element sensitivities while assuming the amplifier to be ideal.

To develop an insertion-loss design theory for these fiters comparable in precision to the one now available in the lumped case, it is first necessary to solve the intermediate problem of discovering necessary and sufficient conditions for a driving-point function to represent the input impedance of a resistor-terminated cascade of generic type. A simple decisive solution with the aid of the 2-variable positive-real concept is offered by 1) introducing the 1-variable real polynomial \"resistivity matrix\" associated with the driving-point function and 2) demonstrating that it must satisfy a fundamental structure constraint. Lastly, in addition to elucidating several important corollaries, the class of characteristic polynomials of all such microwave filters is given a description which reveals the difficulties to be overcome before an exact filter design procedure can be achieved. We wish to emphasize that the necessary and sufficient conditions for realizability presented in this paper are not algorithmic in character but explicit. To make the results accessible to as wide an audience as possible we have adopted a leisurely tutorial style with considerable attention paid to some of the more relevant background material.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1972","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Driving-Point Synthesis of Resistor-Terminated Cascades Composed of Lumped Lossless Passive 2-ports and Commensurate TEM Lines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driving-Point Synthesis of Resistor-Terminated Cascades Composed of Lumped Lossless Passive 2-ports and Commensurate TEM Lines","sourcePdf":"01083557.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027397S","chronDate":"Nov 1972","isNumber":"23420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1083557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1083558,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Given an arbitrary time function as the speci- fied input to an electrical network and another such time function as the desired output, it shows how to go about designing the net- work. These arbitrary time functions may be prescribed either graphically, analytically, or merely as sequences of values at stated intervals of time. The first step is to write the input and output time functions in time-sequence form. Then synthetic division of the output time se- quence by the input time sequence yields the sequence of areas under the impulse curve. The power series expansion of the Laplace trans- form is obtained from this sequence. A rational-function approxima- tion to this power series may then be calculated and, as a result of the special constraints used, the inverse Laplace transform of this ra- tional function will be a close approximation throughout the time domain to the required impulse response. The paper contributes to network theory a simple and straight for- ward synthesis method for the time domain, which is economical of computational time and effort.

The paper presents_anew way of introducing such constraints and reviews some examples in which constraints have been successfully employed. The constraints discussed may be divided into two groups; namely, those depending on some isolated feature of the frequency character- istic of the solution, such as the dc gain or the parasitic-capacitance high-frequency asymptote, and those depending on the complete frequency characteristic, such as the power-handling capacity of an output stage. It is suggested that the introduction of constraints may require a change in the basis of error assessment. In this con- nection an example is given based on a time-weighted criterion.

We are then able to discuss problems of measurement of information, coding, and transmission over noisy channels in terms of discrete samples, rather than continuous time functions. The design of the optimum linear filter reduces from a very difficult analysis problem involving spec- trum factorizatlon to a straightforward problem of solving a set of simultaneous linear equations. Unless we are interested in the most economical implementation, it is not even necessary to solve the equations. since a synthesis procedure involving only simple functions of the correlation functions is available. When extended to the general nonlinear case, the design is still specified by a set of simultaneous algebraic equations, but the labor of solution grows very rapidly. It is proposed to short circuit this labor by building a learning filter which in effect designs itself. A training period in which the adjust- ments are automatically optimized precedes the use period. By modi- fying the training program, it is possible that the filter could be taught to recognize specific signals, including, perhaps, certain speech sounds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1954","publicationDate":"December 1954","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"CT-1","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Communication Theory and Cybernetics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication Theory and Cybernetics","sourcePdf":"01083594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031101S","chronDate":"December  1954","isNumber":"23424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4811122","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1083594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1083610,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It is shown that digitally implemented adaptive gradient algorithms can exhibit effects which are significantly different from those encountered in analog (infinite precision) algorithms. This is illustrated by considering the often quoted result of stochastic approximation that to achieve the optimum rate of convergence in an adaptive algorithm the step size should be proportional to\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/n</tex>\n, where\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</tex>\nis the number of iterations.

It is shown that as the number of iterations becomes large one should not continually decrease the step size in a digital gradient algorithm. This result is a manifestation of the quantization inherent in any digitally implemented system. A surprising result is that these effects produce a digital residual mean-square error that is minimized by making the step size as large as possible. Since the analog residual error is minimized by taking small step sizes, the optimum step-size sequence reflects a compromise between these competing goals. The performance of a time-varying gain sequence suggested by stochastic approximation is contrasted with the performance of a constant step-size sequence. It is shown that in a digital environment the latter sequence is capable of attaining a smaller residual error.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1973","volume":"20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the design of gradient algorithms for digitally implemented adaptive filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of gradient algorithms for digitally implemented adaptive filters","sourcePdf":"01083627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07797S","chronDate":"March  1973","isNumber":"23426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"103","articleId":"1083627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1083657,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The converse problem of computing the sensitivity of a single response variable with respect to variations of several parameters, though apparently more difficult, has recently been solved with equal efficiency by appealing to the concept of an \"adjoint network.\" This concept, however, is shown here to be superfluous, since equivalent (and slightly simpler) formulas can be derived using well-known matrix manipulations alone. The problem of computing the signal/noise ratio of a single network response variable has also been solved by using the adjoint network, concept. But, here again, standard matrix manipulations suffice to yield the same results with less conceptual encumbrance. Thus the adjoint network approach, though still valid, proves to be unnecessary for solving these two problems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1973.1083675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23427","startPage":"285","endPage":"288","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23427/01083675.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network sensitivity and noise analysis simplified","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1973","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network sensitivity and noise analysis simplified","publicationDate":"May 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network sensitivity and noise analysis simplified","sourcePdf":"01083675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042873S","chronDate":"May 1973","isNumber":"23427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"60","articleId":"1083675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1083694,"authors":[{"name":"D.

One is the frequency-dependent sensitivity of the gain to the transfer function coefficients (the gain-to-coefficient sensitivity) and the other is the well-known coefficient-to-component sensitivity. The gain-to-coefficient sensitivity clearly shows that the gain of a biquadratic function is far more sensitive to changes in the resonant frequency\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f_0</tex>\nthan to changes in\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</tex>\nonly near the 3-dB frequencies.

For this case, the explicit solution form enables the test for two-variable positive reality to be discarded in favor of a matrix factorization condition. In the onevariable case, due to the intimate relationship between the synthesis of a cascade of transmission lines and the generation of a sequence of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, Richards' theorem is not required for the explicit-form solution. Initially, the main theorem describing the explicit solution for the one- and two-variable cases is presented.

Distortion analysis of weakly nonlinear circuits has been developed based on the well-known perturbation method. In the frequency domain, the nonlinearities of a transistor are shown to be equivalently represented by intermodulation distortion sources whose amplitudes and phases are iteratively determined by the linear circuit characteristics and the Taylor-series coefficients associated with the nonlinearities. For all practical purposes, only two iterations are sufficient to yield accurate results. An algorithm for computing the second- and third-order intermodulation distortions is described. This algorithm has been implemented in a program called NODAP (nonlinear distortion analysis program). NODAP computes the smallsignal nonlinear transistor model from the recently developed integral change-control model (ICM). It then passes this information through a linear circuit analysis program for distortion computations. Computer results for several transistor circuits using Western Electric highfrequency transistors are all in excellent agreement with the measured data over a wide range of bias conditions and frequencies. This demonstrates the validity of the approach treated in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8147/23430/01083767.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1973.1083767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1973.1083767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23430","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1083767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion analysis of bipolar transistor circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bipolar transistor circuits","Nonlinear distortion","Intermodulation distortion","Linear circuits","Iterative algorithms","Electronic circuits","Nonlinear circuits","Perturbation methods","Frequency domain analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Active networks","Bipolar transistor circuits","Computer-aided circuit analysis","Intermodulation distortions","Nonlinear distortions","Nonlinear networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1973","displayDocTitle":"Distortion analysis of bipolar transistor circuits","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion analysis of bipolar transistor circuits","sourcePdf":"01083767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03088S","chronDate":"Nov 1973","isNumber":"23430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8147","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1083767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1083769,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The gate circuit is designed for sample and hold and resampler operations prior to digitalization and after decoding. As in the sampling circuits previously designed for an experimental high-speed high-performance PCM terminal, the diode quad gate is switched by a current routing emitter-coupled transistor pair. In this configuration the diodes are effectively current switched, resulting in extremely low distortion of the signal samples. With the most commonly used voltage-controlled diode quad gate, subnanosecond switching speeds are required to obtain the same linearity obtained here with much lower switching speeds. In the voice-band coding application, any appreciable gate output voltage offset can impair the overall coder-decoder S/N ratio for low level signals. A novel circuit arrangement has been incorporated into the basic current-routed diode gate circuit, which reduces the output voltage offset normally associated with circuits of this type to very low levels. Although the particular circuit to be described is only moderately fast, a similar configuration having all the features, using higher speed beam leaded transistors and diodes available, would switch in the order of a nanosecond.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1083891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1974","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1974","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thin-film auto-balance diode gate for voice-band sample and hold and resampler circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin-film auto-balance diode gate for voice-band sample and hold and resampler circuits","sourcePdf":"01083891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020158S","chronDate":"Jul 1974","isNumber":"23434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","articleId":"1083891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1083908,"authors":[{"name":"S.

EL's reasoning is based on the concept of a \"local one-step deduction\" augmented by various \"teleological\" principles and by the concept of a \"macro-element.\" Several annotated examples of EL in operation and an explanation of how it works are presented. Also how EL can be extended in several directions, including sinusoidal steady-state analysis is shown.

The device modeling takes account of the back-gate bias effects and the bidirectionality of transmission gates. The simulation mechanism and the detailed device modeling lead to simulation of the dependence of propagation delays on input waveforms. The loading and device capacitances are assumed to be constant and bootstrapping effects are not simulated. The simulator has been implemented on a minicomputer having a 32K-word memory of 16-bit words, a disk module, and a storage CRT/keyboard terminal. This configuration allows simulation of circuits having 1000 gates with an operational speed of approximately 2 ms of real time per gate per nanosecond of circuit time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23440/01084003.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1975.1084003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1975.1084003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOTIS-An MOS timing simulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Circuit simulation","Analytical models","Logic circuits","Logic devices","Circuit analysis","Propagation delay","Capacitance","Microcomputers","Cathode ray tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer applications, circuit design","MOSFET logic circuits","Solid-state integrated circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1975","displayDocTitle":"MOTIS-An MOS timing simulator","volume":"22","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1975","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOTIS-An MOS timing simulator","sourcePdf":"01084003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025457S","chronDate":"Dec 1975","isNumber":"23440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"209","articleId":"1084003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084009,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The problem of unrealizability that is implied by delay-free loops in the discrete signal flow graph is overcome by using transformations that correspond to LC elements that exhibit finite Cube factors. The resultant deterioration in the passband of the transfer function is determined from the Blowstein LC ladder sensitivity theory and is, thereby, shown to be low valued at high sampling frequencies. The sensitivity properties of this class of digital ladder filters are directly analogous to the LC prototype because each LC element is replaced by a digital multiplier.

A general optimum solution is not found; instead, a heuristic solution is presented along with a complete working implementation program for large scale computers. For the case where the number of waves and the vector velocities are known, the solution is optimum. The detection of waves and the estimation of their bearing, velocity, and waveshape is accomplished via digital filtering of the frequencywavenumber power spectrum, which is computed via an efficient estimator, of the array sensed data. A new approach to the multiwave estimation problem is to reduce it to a succession of single wave problems using especially developed frequency-wavenumber filters. Special attention is given throughout the study to computationally efficient approaches. The results of the paper are placed in perspective by showing how the historically important approaches to the processing of array data such as delay and sum, weighted delay and sum, array prewhitening, beam forming, inverse filtering, least mean-square estimation, and maximum likelihood estimation are related via the spatio-temporal filtering of the frequency-wavenumber spectrum. The spectral estimation, digital filtering, and the multiwave maximum likelihood estimator developments are demonstrated by the processing of a set of simulated planewaves of various bearings, velocities, and frequencies, as well as by processing electroencephalographic (brain wave) data monitored via an array of scalp electrodes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite wavefront decomposition via multidimensional digital filtering of array data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1975.1084081","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23445/01084081.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1975.1084081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084081/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1975","displayDocTitle":"Composite wavefront decomposition via multidimensional digital filtering of array data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite wavefront decomposition via multidimensional digital filtering of array data","sourcePdf":"01084081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060231S","chronDate":"Jun 1975","isNumber":"23445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"29","articleId":"1084081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1084105,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Dynamic nonlinear networks containing capacitors, inductors, resistors, and sources such that there are loops of capacitors, or cutsets of inductors are shown to be equivalent to networks without such loops or cutsets. Explicit analytical expressions are given for specifying the constitutive relations of the elements of the equivalent circuit. This result allows the generalization of many previous results in nonlinear networks which exclude capacitor loops and inductor cutsets.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1976.1084220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23456","startPage":"292","endPage":"312","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23456/01084220.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1976.1084220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-theoretic properties of dynamic nonlinear networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Capacitors","Resistors","Inductors","Nonlinear equations","Graph theory","Steady-state","Equivalent circuits","Circuit stability","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Graph theory","Multiport networks","Nonlinear circuits and systems","Nonlinear networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1976","displayDocTitle":"Graph-theoretic properties of dynamic nonlinear networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-theoretic properties of dynamic nonlinear networks","sourcePdf":"01084220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044558S","chronDate":"May  1976","isNumber":"23456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1084220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1084222,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A very general and rather surprising result is presented which guarantees that most autonomous and nonautonomous dynamic nonlinear active networks of practical interest have no finite \"forward\" escape time solutions. In the case of autonomous networks, sufficient conditions are given which guarantee that the solution waveforms possess various forms of stability properties. The concepts of eventual passivity and eventual strict passivity are invoked to guarantee that all solution waveforms are bounded and eventually uniformly bounded, respectively. The properties of reciprocity and monotonicity (local passivity) are invoked to guarantee that all solutions are completely stable. The further imposition of a growth condition guarantees that all solutions will converge to a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point. In this case, the magnitude of all solutions is shown to be bounded between two exponential waveforms for all time\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t &gt; 0</tex>\n. An algorithm is presented which computes for the maximum \"transient decay\" time constant associated with the upper bounding exponential. The main features of the majority of the theorems presented in this paper are that their hypotheses are simple and easily verifiable-often by inspection. The hypotheses are of two types: first, very general conditions on the network state equations and second, conditions on the individual element characteristics and their interconnections. The hypotheses and proofs of the latter type of theorems depend heavily upon the graphtheoretic results of an earlier paper [14] and involve solely the examination of the global nature of each element's constitutive relation and the verification of a topological \"loop-cutset\" conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1976.1084228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23457/01084228.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1976.1084228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"355","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A qualitative analysis of the behavior of dynamic nonlinear networks: Stability of autonomous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1976","displayDocTitle":"A qualitative analysis of the behavior of dynamic nonlinear networks: Stability of autonomous networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084228/","volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A qualitative analysis of the behavior of dynamic nonlinear networks: Stability of autonomous networks","sourcePdf":"01084228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028185S","chronDate":"June  1976","isNumber":"23457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1084228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1084234,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An output noise variance formula in terms of the internal structure is derived. Conditions for minimizing this output noise are established and realizations which meet these conditions are constructed. A new set of filter invariants called second-order modes are defined and shown to play a definitive role in minimal noise realizations. From these invariants, for example, one can calculate the minimal output noise variance of a given external specification. Numerical results are given which compare these new filter structures with the usual parallel and cascade connections of second-order filters, both theoretically and through simulations. For narrow-band filters, these new structures can be orders of magnitude better (in terms of output noise variance). One drawback of these new structures is a large increase in the number of multipliers needed to realize them. However, by applying the theory to subfilters connected in parallel and cascade, a good compromise between output noise and number of multipliers is obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of minimum roundoff noise fixed point digital filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1976.1084254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23460/01084254.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1976.1084254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1976","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of minimum roundoff noise fixed point digital filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of minimum roundoff noise fixed point digital filters","sourcePdf":"01084254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034191S","chronDate":"September  1976","isNumber":"23460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"620","articleId":"1084254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084258,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The input waveforms of the sources may be aperiodic, periodic, or almost periodic. Sufficient conditions are given which guarantee that the solution waveforms possess various forms of stability properties. The concepts of eventual passivity and eventual strict passivity are invoked to guarantee that all solution waveforms are bounded and eventually uniformly bounded, respectively, for all bounded inputs. In particular, conditions are given such that a \"small-signal\" input will give rise to a \"small-signal\" output, thereby justifying the validity of the small-signal analysis approach for this class of networks. The properties of reciprocity and monotonicity (local passivity) are invoked to guarantee that the network has a unique steady-state response for all bounded excitations. In particular, conditions are given such that a periodic (respectively, asymptotically almost periodic) input gives rise to a unique periodic (respectively, asymptotically almost periodic) output. Moreover, conditions are given such that the frequency spectrum of the output waveforms is a subset of all linear combinations of the frequency components of the input waveforms. A further imposition of a growth condition guarantees that all solution waveforms will converge to each other asymptotically. In particular, the magnitude of the differences between any two solutions is shown to be bounded between two exponential waveforms for all time\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t &gt; 0</tex>\n. The main features of the majority of the theeorems presented in this paper are that their hypotheses are simple and easily verifiable-often by inspection. The hypotheses are of two types: first, very general conditions on the network state equations and second, conditions on the individual element characteristics and their interconnections. The hypotheses and proofs of the latter type of theorems depend heavily upon the graph-theoretic results of an earlier paper [14] and involve solely the examination of the global nature of each element's constitutive relation and the verification of a topological \"loop-cutset\" condition. Several counter examples are given to demonstrate that most of the theorems presented in this paper are the best possible for the class of networks under consideration in the sense that a slight weakening of any one hypothesis would invalidate the theorems.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1976.1084258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23460/01084258.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1976.1084258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A qualitative analysis of the behavior of dynamic nonlinear networks: Steady-state solutions of nonautonomous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084258/","displayDocTitle":"A qualitative analysis of the behavior of dynamic nonlinear networks: Steady-state solutions of nonautonomous networks","volume":"23","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 1976","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A qualitative analysis of the behavior of dynamic nonlinear networks: Steady-state solutions of nonautonomous networks","sourcePdf":"01084258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069307S","chronDate":"September  1976","isNumber":"23460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1084258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084264,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Lin Chang","affiliation":["Electronics Research Division, Rockwell International, Anaheim, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tien-Lin Chang","id":"37422063800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-4094"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1276"}],"articleNumber":"1084264","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Limit-cycles","Digital filters","Sufficient conditions","Two dimensional displays","Digital signal processing","Fixed-point arithmetic","Partial differential equations","Upper bound","Circuits and systems","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital networks","Fixed-point digital filters","Multidimensional digital filters","Recursive digital filter wordlength effects"]}],"abstract":"Limit cycles in a two-dimensional first-order digital filter are analyzed.

For many years residue number coding has been recognized as a system which provides a capability for the implementation of high speed multiplication and addition. The advantages of residue coding for the design of high speed FIR filters result from the fact that an FIR requires only the high speed residue operations, i.e., addition and multiplication, while not requiring the slower RNS operations of division or sign detection. A new hardware implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for an efficient translation of residue coded outputs into natural numbers. A numerical example illustrates the principles of residue encoding, residue arithmetic, and residue decoding for FIR filters. An RNS implementation of a 64th-order dual bandpass filter is compared with several alternative filter structures to illustrate tradeoffs between speed and hardware complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1977.1084321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23467/01084321.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1977.1084321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of residue number systems in the design of finite impulse response digital filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1977","displayDocTitle":"The use of residue number systems in the design of finite impulse response digital filters","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1977","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of residue number systems in the design of finite impulse response digital filters","sourcePdf":"01084321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024838S","chronDate":"Apr 1977","isNumber":"23467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"205","articleId":"1084321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084324,"authors":[{"name":"Wai-Kai Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Wai-Kai Chen","id":"37087417306"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-4094"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1276"}],"articleNumber":"1084324","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explicit formulas for the synthesis of optimum broad-band impedance-matching networks","abstract":"The paper shows that the most practical RLC load can be optimally matched to a resistive generator over a finite frequency band to achieve the Butterworth or Chebyshev transducer power-gain characteristic of arbitrary order, justifying and extending the procedure given in the literature.

The applicability of the method relies on the fact that every nonlinear device is modeled by a piecewise-linear continuous function. In order to extend the applicability of piecewise-linear analysis to treat more general nonlinear networks, three steps need to be carried out: i) the subdivision of the domain of the multi-dimensional nonlinear network function; ii) the interpolation of a piecewise-linear continuous function on the subdivided domain; and iii) the application of piecewise-linear analysis. It turns out that the above three steps can be accomplished effectively by using simplicial subdivision. In addition, the difficulties encountered in the conventional piecewise-linear analysis are simplified. The memory space needed for the analysis is also greatly reduced.

It is shown that considerable improvement in pole and transfer-characteristic stability of active filters can be expected by minimizing the GSP.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Active filters","Stability","Digital filters","Polynomials","Multidimensional systems","Circuit testing","Mathematical analysis","Mechanical engineering","Education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Active filters","Network sensitivity optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCS.1977.1084363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23471/01084363.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1977.1084363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing nonideal op-amp effects in active filters by minimizing the gain-sensitivity product (GSP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing nonideal op-amp effects in active filters by minimizing the gain-sensitivity product (GSP)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084363/","volume":"24","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1977","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing nonideal op-amp effects in active filters by minimizing the gain-sensitivity product (GSP)","sourcePdf":"01084363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033994S","chronDate":"August  1977","isNumber":"23471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1084363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084390,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Based upon multidimensional linear cuts of the tolerance orthotope and uniform distributions of outcomes between tolerance extremes in the orthotope, exact formulas for yield and yield sensitivities, with respect to design parameters, are derived. The formulas employ the intersections of the cuts with the orthotope edges, the cuts themselves being functions of the original design constraints. Our computational approach involves the approximation of all the constraints by low-order multidimensional polynomials. These approximations are continually updated during optimization. Inherent advantages of the approximations which we have exploited are that explicit sensitivities of the design performance are not required, available simulation programs can be used, inexpensive function and gradient evaluations can be made, inexpensive calculations at vertices of the tolerance orthotope are facilitated during optimization and, subsequently, inexpensive Monte Carlo verification is possible. Simple circuit examples illustrate worst case design and design with yields of less then 100 percent. The examples also provide verification of the formulas and algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1978.1084392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23474/01084392.pdf","endPage":"871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal centering, tolerancing, and yield determination via updated approximations and cuts","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1978.1084392","startPage":"853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1978","displayDocTitle":"Optimal centering, tolerancing, and yield determination via updated approximations and cuts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084392/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"October 1978","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal centering, tolerancing, and yield determination via updated approximations and cuts","sourcePdf":"01084392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034236S","chronDate":"Oct 1978","isNumber":"23474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1084392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1084399,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This is illustrated by some specific examples.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1978.1084428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23476/01084428.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1978.1084428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1091","endPage":"1098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of wave digital lattice filters with short coefficient word lengths and optimal dynamic range","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1978","displayDocTitle":"On the design of wave digital lattice filters with short coefficient word lengths and optimal dynamic range","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084428/","volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1978","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of wave digital lattice filters with short coefficient word lengths and optimal dynamic range","sourcePdf":"01084428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054162S","chronDate":"Dec 1978","isNumber":"23476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1084428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084442,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first approach, based on the associated mixed radix number system, is particularly useful when it is desired to translate the residue samples directly into analog form. The second approach, based on the Chinese remainder theorem, is a more direct method for translating from residue to weighted binary representation.

In the presence of noise due to quantization and threshold inaccuracies, new optimum linear predictor coefficients that are signal statistics independent were obtained. The noise due to circuit inaccuracies was found to have a pronounced effect on the S/N performance for both the digital and the analog predictor DPCM configurations. On the basis of these newly derived results there are strong indications that, in the presence of circuit imperfections, the S/N performance attainable by a simply oversampled A/D converter constitutes an upper bound on performance for any DPCM system constructed with components of similar accuracy.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23482/01084500.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum design, performance evaluation, and inherent limitations of DPCM encoders","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1978.1084500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1978.1084500","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1978","displayDocTitle":"Optimum design, performance evaluation, and inherent limitations of DPCM encoders","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"July 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum design, performance evaluation, and inherent limitations of DPCM encoders","sourcePdf":"01084500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03874S","chronDate":"Jul 1978","isNumber":"23482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1084500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1084501,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In other words, interval arithmetic provides a method for performing global optimization over a simple domain. The network function of a linear network can be written in a multilinear form where some or all of the component values appear as variables. For a given frequency it is thus possible to compute the range of the network function over the intervals of the selected component values. Dependence on a common parameter such as temperature can also be modeled. By interval arithmetic a true worst-case analysis with sharp bounds can be performed. The interval result quoted above can be obtained with a method detecting intervals of monotonicity by interval computation of the partial derivatives. If the network function is not monotone over the whole domain, a partitioning technique is used to obtain intervals with monotonicity. The method is demonstrated on two examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23486/01084570.pdf","startPage":"874","endPage":"879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1979.1084570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1979.1084570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"True worst-case analysis of linear electrical circuits by interval arithmetic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arithmetic","Transfer functions","Computer networks","Frequency","Circuit analysis computing","Temperature dependence","Impedance","Admittance","Circuit theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Arithmetic","Computer-aided circuit analysis and design","Network optimization","Network tolerance analysis","Optimization techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1979","displayDocTitle":"True worst-case analysis of linear electrical circuits by interval arithmetic","volume":"26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"True worst-case analysis of linear electrical circuits by interval arithmetic","sourcePdf":"01084570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028771S","chronDate":"October  1979","isNumber":"23486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1084570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1084576,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We idealize and generalize these operations to define a general class of networks for discrete-time linear filtering. A p-phase charge-routing network (CRN) consists of a collection of storage cells divided into p subgroups and a routing procedure controlled by a p-phase clock. During a particular clock phase, charge is routed from a particular subgroup of storage cells into another subgroup. In this manner charge is routed successively through each subgroup of cells and a periodically time-varying linear discrete-time network is defined by specifying matrices of weight values associated with the routing procedure. Analysis of a\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</tex>\n-phase CRN yields a reduced system of linear time-invariant dynamic state equations convenient for signal-processing studies. Necessary and sufficient conditions on such a system of state equations are given for realizability as a\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</tex>\n-phase CRN. The varied structures attainable with CRN's can realize infinite inpulse-response filter transfer functions. However, certain fundamental restrictions exist on the class of transfer functions realizable with CRN's. In particular, we show the existence of forbidden zones within the unit circle in the z-plane, where poles (or natural modes) of a CRN cannot occur. A parallel can be drawn between classical RC networks and charge-routing networks. Both types of networks have substantial restrictions on the class of filters they can by themselves realize. For RC networks, we know the limitations can be overcome by the addition of another component (inductance or operational amplifier). A similar potential may exist for CRN's. This paper provides a foundation for a general theory that could offer realizability conditions and sythesis procedures for discrete-time filtering via charge routing networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1979.1084617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23489/01084617.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"92","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1979.1084617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge-routing networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1979","displayDocTitle":"Charge-routing networks","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084617/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge-routing networks","sourcePdf":"01084617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026887S","chronDate":"February  1979","isNumber":"23489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1084617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1084622,"authors":[{"name":"Chyi Lu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Chyi Lu","id":"37087946524"},{"name":"S.

We present a new mathematical formulation of the concept of force directed placement, and describe an efficient computational procedure for solving the resulting system of equations. The placement procedure is broken down into two phases, Phase I being the \"relative location phase,\" and Phase II being the \"slot assignment or component overlap resolution phase.\" In Phase I of the procedure, we solve a set of simultaneous equations, based upon the interconnection topology of the system of components, in an endeavor to determine the optimum relative location of every component with respect to every other component. The equations are set up such that there are attractive forces between components sharing a common signal, and repulsive forces between components having no signals in common. The results of Phase I are often unacceptable from a physical standpoint because there is a great deal of overlap among the components. Phase II eliminates component overlap by either of two methods, depending upon the physical properties of the carrier. If the carrier is subdivided into slots, then the components are assigned to these slots using a criteria which minimiZes the total distance that all components need be moved. We perform this assignment by using the linear assignment algorithm. If the carrier is such that components are allowed to reside anywhere, then a different technique to resolve component overlap is used. A parametric analysis of the procedure is given based upon 12 different PCB's. These results show comparisons of this method to the work of others, and provide some insight into the method's absolute merits.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1979.1084652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23493/01084652.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1979.1084652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A forced directed component placement procedure for printed circuit boards","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1979","displayDocTitle":"A forced directed component placement procedure for printed circuit boards","volume":"26","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084652/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A forced directed component placement procedure for printed circuit boards","sourcePdf":"01084652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028765S","chronDate":"Jun 1979","isNumber":"23493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"176","articleId":"1084652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1084653,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The effectiveness of this approach depends upon inclusion of a sufficiently high percentage of potential field failures in the fault dictionary, and upon implementation of the inherent testability design features of the dc approach, i.e, to have specified adequate test stimuli and to have indicated the appropriate nodes/test points for accessibility.

After recalling the general problems of automatic testing (definitions, faults in analog systems, different types of tests, main operations, and diagnosis procedures), characterization and description modes of analog systems, and the main software ingredients of automatic test equipment, a categorization of known techniques along several criteria can be proposed. Then, several techniques, respectively, proceeding from approaches based on deterministic and probabilistic estimation, taxonomical and topological analyses can be detailed. Techniques specific to linear systems (several of them belonging to the above three categories) are dealt with in a separate section. The main features of the techniques that are described are summed up in five synoptic tables. As a conclusion, several research areas that need further investigation in view of a possible industrial implementation of automatic analog test generation techniques are identified.

A Newton-Raphson iteration, based on a describing function representation for the nonlinear circuit components, is used to numerically solve the circuit equations.

The problems considered are defined mathematically as a worst-case problem (WCP), a fixed tolerance problem (FTP), and a variable tolerance problem (VTP). The basic optimization problem without tolerances is denoted the zero tolerance problem (ZTP). For solution of the WCP we suggest application of interval arithmetic and also alternative methods. For solution of the FTP an algorithm is suggested which is conceptually similar to algorithms previously developed by the authors for the ZTP. Finally, the VTP is solved by a double-iterative algorithm in which the inner iteration is performed by the FTP- algorithm. The application of the algorithm is demonstrated by means of relatively simple numerical examples. Basic properties, such as convergence properties, are displayed based on the examples.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1979.1084700","startPage":"775","endPage":"783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23496/01084700.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1979.1084700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for worst-case tolerance optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Minimization","Arithmetic","Minimax techniques","Optimization methods","Circuits and systems","Systems engineering and theory","Functional programming","Linear programming","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Network tolerance assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1979","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for worst-case tolerance optimization","volume":"26","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1979","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for worst-case tolerance optimization","sourcePdf":"01084700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047121S","chronDate":"Sep 1979","isNumber":"23496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"46","articleId":"1084700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1084701,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The method maximizes the impact of a single constrained Linear Programming (LP) step on a nonlinear design problem. The method thus becomes, for large problems, an economic first-order alternative to expensive completely convergent optimization algorithms. By fully exploiting the customary investment of IC designers in large change (and/or adjoint) sensitivity computation, the interactive (and inexpensive) LP design subproblem becomes a paradigm of the larger nonlinear design problem, in which critical tradeoffs and limitations become evident. In comparison with previously reported design methods, the key points of novelty are 1) the interactive role of the user in searching for a maximally effective LP step, 2) the combination of function minimization, step size minimization, and function inequality constraints in the LP step, and 3) linear prediction of all performance objective functions. Examples are given of the application of the method to the design and modeling of practical digital logic circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23498/01084728.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1980.1084728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1980.1084728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interactive linear programming approach to model parameter fitting and worst case circuit design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Circuit synthesis","Design optimization","Design methodology","Investments","Minimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Economic forecasting","Logic design","Logic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer-aided circuit analysis and design","Linear programming","Logic circuits","Network tolerance assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1980","displayDocTitle":"An interactive linear programming approach to model parameter fitting and worst case circuit design","volume":"27","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interactive linear programming approach to model parameter fitting and worst case circuit design","sourcePdf":"01084728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06454S","chronDate":"Oct 1980","isNumber":"23498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1084728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1084733,"authors":[{"name":"Pen-Min Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Pen-Min Lin","id":"37383727800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-4094"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1276"}],"articleNumber":"1084733","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084733","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit theory","Tree graphs","Circuit analysis","Frequency","Terminology","Intersymbol interference","Circuits and systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Graph theory and applications","Network theory","Trees"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study the properties of complementary-tree graphs and describe the applications of such graphs in circuit theory.

Each approach is ilustrated with 2 examples: Gunn Diode and SCR for the physical approach and Hysteretic Inductor and Memristive Device for the black-box approach. While the techniques for carrying out the first 3 steps in each approach presently involve more art than science, a unified theory for carrying out the last step (nonlinear network synthesis) is beginning to emerge. In particular, the universe of all lumped nonlinear circuit elements can now be classified into algebraic and dynamic elements via a completely logical axiomatic approach. Contrary to what is the case in linear circuit theory, it is shown that an infinite variety of basic algebraic and dynamic elements will be needed in the eventual formulation of a unified theory on device modeling. Consequently, these elements are given a complete and in-depth treatment in this paper.

The class of networks being surveyed may contain multi-terminal and multi-port RESISTORS, INDUCTORS, AND CAPACITORS, as well as dc and time-dependent voltage and current sources. The concepts of impasse points and local solvability are introduced and shown to be of fundamental importance in modeling a physical network. Simple criteria are given which guarantee the existence of a global state equation. General theorems are presented for identifying or testing whether a dynamic nonlinear network possesses one or more of the following basic qualitative properties: 1. No finite-forward-escape-time solutions. 2. Local asymptotic stability of equilibrium points and observability of operating points. 3. Eventual uniform-boundedness of solutions. 4. Complete stability and global asymptotic stability. 5. Existence of a dc or periodic steady-state solution. 6. Unique steady-state response and spectrum conservation. The hypotheses of most of these theorems are couched in graph- and circuit-theoretic terms so they can be easily checked, often by inspection. Special efforts are made to state the concepts and results in a form that can be easily understood and used by the nonspecialist. Moreover, each concept and property is profusely illustrated with carefully conceived examples, and intuitive explanations so as to make this paper both motivating and somewhat self-contained. Extensive references are provided to facilitate researchers interested in conducting future research on the many unsolved problems in dynamic nonlinear networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1980","volume":"27","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1980","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic nonlinear networks: State-of-the-art","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic nonlinear networks: State-of-the-art","sourcePdf":"01084745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06217S","chronDate":"Nov 1980","isNumber":"23499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"133","articleId":"1084745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1084783,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In order to obtain quadratic convergence from the extrapolation methods, the derivatives of F and G must be Lipschitz continuous. The appendixes give sufficient conditions for the Lipschitz continuity. A discussion of practical problems related to the implementation of the extrapolation methods is based on the convergence theorem and the error analysis. The performance of the extrapolation methods is demonstrated and compared with other methods for steady-state analysis by four examples, two autonomous and two nonautonomous. Extrapolation methods are very easy to implement, and they are efficient for the steady-state analysis of nonlinear circuits with few reactive elements giving rise to slowly decaying transients.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of the periodic steady-state response of nonlinear networks by extrapolation methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1980.1084794","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23502/01084794.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1980.1084794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1980","displayDocTitle":"Computation of the periodic steady-state response of nonlinear networks by extrapolation methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of the periodic steady-state response of nonlinear networks by extrapolation methods","sourcePdf":"01084794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066026S","chronDate":"March  1980","isNumber":"23502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"145","articleId":"1084794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084796,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results are given for the two common forms of the FFT algorithmn, decimation in-frequency and in-time. The analysis assumes sign-magnitude (or 1's complement) arithmetic and is presented in detail for the decimation-in-frequency (DIF) case. The correlation coefficients are computed analytically. A few assumptions, made in the analysis, are verified by computer simulations. The average variance of the output noise, due to the truncation errors, predicted by the new model is approximately twice the corresponding value predicted by the old model (which assumes that the truncation errors are uncorrelated). The output noise-to-signal ratios predicted by the revised and old expressions are compared with experimental results. It is shown that the revised result predicts much closer to the experimental results than the old.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1980.1084870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23507/01084870.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1980.1084870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23507","startPage":"712","endPage":"716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of correlation between transactions errors on fixed-point fast Fourier transform analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of correlation between transactions errors on fixed-point fast Fourier transform analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of correlation between transactions errors on fixed-point fast Fourier transform analysis","sourcePdf":"01084870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039619S","chronDate":"Aug 1980","isNumber":"23507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1084870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1084878,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The application of Bode's general and exact theory of feedback to practical circuits of considerable complexity, such as a complete repeater, has been achieved by a new method based upon measurements over a very wide band of frequencies. Transistor models and circuit diagrams are not required above the traffic band. The theory of the method is presented in nodal analysis terms. The principal result is a set of relationships between determinants of a 4-node matrix derived from measurements and corresponding determinants of a hypothetical, multinode matrix of the complete circuit. Extensive software was developed to translate the theoretical results and insights into algorithms. These have been applied to several practical amplifiers with outstanding results. Apart from stability assessment, feedback also affects sensitivities and some results due to Bode are extended to cover large changes. Return ratios and related quantities have been evaluated for transistors in practical amplifiers over the range 1-1300 MHz, with accuracies comparable with those of the basic\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</tex>\n-parameters. Reliable gain and phase margins, and values of total feedback and sensitivities, have been computed without the need to split a node as required for loop gain. More information, greater assurance in circuit design, and a potential tool in amplifier development have been achieved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1980.1084895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23508/01084895.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"792","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1980.1084895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved methods of assessing feedback in wide-band multiloop amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1980","displayDocTitle":"Improved methods of assessing feedback in wide-band multiloop amplifiers","volume":"27","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved methods of assessing feedback in wide-band multiloop amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01084895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036852S","chronDate":"September  1980","isNumber":"23508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1084895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1084901,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The best among the local optimum solutions is taken as a final solution. The iterative improvement method proposed here is different from the previous one, in the sense that it considers interchanging more than two modules at the same time and examines only a small portion of feasible solutions which has high probability of being better.

The design employs modular architecture and a pipeline approach with emitter coupled logic (ECL) Integrated circuits and uses table look-up for calculations in the residue number system. Components have been chosen so that the filter is capable of making thirty million five-by-five filter convolutions per second for two-dimensional pulse matching and signal detection. In actual operation the hardware runs error free at the rate of twenty million operations per second.

The method is based on the fact that the FT at an arbitrary frequency can be expressed as a weighted sum of its Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) coefficients. In the proposed method, these weights are suitably approximated so that the desired FT is very nearly the sum of (i) a few dominant terms of the sum of the DFT which are computed directly, and (ii) the DFT of a new sequence obtained by multiplying the original sequence with a sawtooth function. The number of directly computed terms is so chosen that the error of approximation does not exceed the specified limits. The computational aspects of the algorithm and its error behavior with typical signals have been critically examined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast computation of Fourier transforms at arbitrary frequencies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1981.1084922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23510/01084922.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1981.1084922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1084922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1981","displayDocTitle":"Fast computation of Fourier transforms at arbitrary frequencies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"October 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast computation of Fourier transforms at arbitrary frequencies","sourcePdf":"01084922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062243S","chronDate":"Oct 1981","isNumber":"23510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1084922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084926,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Assessing the testability and test complexity of a given system is one such problem. In fact, robust, quantitative measures of these important features have not been available to the analog testing community. This paper introduces new measures for both testability and test complexity which: 1) are quantitative, 2) are capable of handling multiple faults, and 3) have a well-defined interpretation. These measures are based upon published results from optimal experiment designs as developed in the discipline of systems identification. Parameter testability is defined in terms of information (in the sense of Fisher) return, while test complexity is functionally related to the experiment time required to achieve specified accuracy with regard to the uncertain parameters of interest. Thus both of the new measures introduced depend, not only upon the specific system at hand, but also upon the experimental conditions used in performing the tests. The results of this approach lead to quantitative measures that have optimality features based upon the Cramer-Rao bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084926/","volume":"28","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1981","displayDocTitle":"New measures of testability and test complexity for linear analog failure analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New measures of testability and test complexity for linear analog failure analysis","sourcePdf":"01084926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047107S","chronDate":"Nov 1981","isNumber":"23511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1084926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1084935,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The image restoration problem is formulated in the framework of the well-known Kalman strip filter. However, the Kalman filtering scheme assumes the availability of a statespace dynamic model for the image process as well as the blur. In the past, most researchers have sought to track the problem of image modeling by making the sometimes unrealistic assumption of separability of the image correlation. A new technique for image modeling which does not make this assumption is proposed. On-line, recursive methods for implementing the modeling algorithm are also presented. We then introduce a novel technique for the state-space realization of separable blurs, since separable 2-D blurs are often encountered in practice and constitute an important subset of 2-D blurs. This state-space model is rendered compatible with strip filtering by using a new recursive scheme which we call as pseudorecursion. An extension for estimating the blur when it is unknown, but can be parameterized, has also been indicated. Simulated experimental results using natural scenery are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1981.1084992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"307","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1981.1084992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23515","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23515/01084992.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Filtering","Image restoration","Degradation","Large scale integration","Nonlinear filters","Additive white noise","Strips","Rendering (computer graphics)","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Image processing","Image restoration","Kalman filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New results in two-dimensional Kalman filtering with applications to image restoration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084992/","volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New results in two-dimensional Kalman filtering with applications to image restoration","sourcePdf":"01084992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032008S","chronDate":"Apr 1981","isNumber":"23515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1084992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1084993,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A general condition for high-frequency synthesis applicability is given, together with a method which allows direct converter design from the desired input-output characterizations. Furthermore, a general model is introduced for high-frequency synthesis converters; as a consequence, they are characterized as two-port, multipole, time varying, linear circuit elements. Finally, as a major application example, a new AC-AC, three-to-three phase converter is introduced. The new converter displays several attractive features: sinusoidal waveforms, bidirectionality, separate control over amplitude, frequency, phase, and power factor. Moreover, depending on which side is taken as an input, it can either step up or step down the voltage. For these reasons the new converter can be regarded to as a generalized transformer.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1981.1084993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23515/01084993.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1981.1084993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solid-state power conversion: A Fourier analysis approach to generalized transformer synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1981","displayDocTitle":"Solid-state power conversion: A Fourier analysis approach to generalized transformer synthesis","volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solid-state power conversion: A Fourier analysis approach to generalized transformer synthesis","sourcePdf":"01084993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022272S","chronDate":"Apr 1981","isNumber":"23515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"303","articleId":"1084993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1084999,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Application of the models to reliability analysis is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1981.1084999","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"367","endPage":"382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23516/01084999.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1981.1084999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expected value analysis of combinational logic networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Circuit simulation","Active filters","Education","Circuit synthesis","Design engineering","Delay effects","IEEE Press","Computational modeling","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Analog and logic circuits analysis","Combinational circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1981","displayDocTitle":"Expected value analysis of combinational logic networks","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"May 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1084999/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expected value analysis of combinational logic networks","sourcePdf":"01084999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036183S","chronDate":"May 1981","isNumber":"23516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1084999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1085001,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Such transfer functions do result in optimum response when the terminations are purely resistive. However, assuming the overall transducer gain characteristic has monotone decreasing stopband behavior, the equal ripple transfer function is shown to be not optimum for a complex load. Furthermore, equalizers simpler in structure and superior in frequency response to equal ripple designs can readily be synthesized. Indeed it appears that nonoptimality will generally result whenever analytic gain-bandwidth theory is used to determine the constants of a transfer function belonging to an a priori specified class.

This new filter, called the time-sequenced adaptive filter, is an extension of the least mean-square error (LMS) adaptive filter. Both the LMS and timesequenced adaptive filters are digital filters composed of a tapped delay line and adjustable weights, whose impulse response is controlled by an adaptive algorithm. For stationary stochastic inputs the mean-square error, which is the expected value of the squared difference between the filter output and an externally supplied \"desired response,\" is a quadratic function of the weights--a paraboloid with a single fixed minimum point which can be sought by gradient techniques, such as the LMS algorithm. For nonstationary inputs however the minimum point, curvature, and orientation of the error surface could be changing over time. The time-sequenced adaptive filter is applicable to the estimation of that subset of nonstationary signals having a recurring (but not necessarily periodic) statistical character, e.g., recurring pulses in noise. In this case there are a finite number of different paraboloidal error surfaces, also recurring in time. The time-sequenced adaptive filter uses multiple sets of adjustable weights. At each point in time, one and only one set of weights is selected to form the filter output and to be adapted using the LMS algorithm. The index of the set of weights chosen is synchronized with the recurring statistical character of the filter input so that each set of weights is associated with a single error surface. After many adaptations of each set of weights, the minimum point of each error surface is reached resulting in an optimal time-varying filter. For this procedure, some a priori knowledge of the filter input is required to synchronize the selection of the set of weights with the recurring statistics of the filter input. For pulse-type signals, this a priori knowledge could be the location of the pulses in time; for signals with periodic statistics, knowledge of the period is sufficient. Possible applications of the time-sequenced adaptive filter include electrocardiogram enhancement and electric load prediction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23517/01085012.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1981.1085012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1981.1085012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The time-sequenced adaptive filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Least squares approximation","Delay lines","Transversal filters","Stochastic processes","Statistics","Signal to noise ratio","Vectors","Digital filters","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Adaptive estimation","Adaptive filters","Applications","Digital filters, time-varying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1981","displayDocTitle":"The time-sequenced adaptive filter","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The time-sequenced adaptive filter","sourcePdf":"01085012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063501S","chronDate":"Jun 1981","isNumber":"23517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1085012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1085013,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Senne, and it represents the most complete treatment of the subject published to date.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23517/01085024.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1981.1085024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1981.1085024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance advantage of complex LMS for controlling narrow-band adaptive arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Narrowband","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Adaptive arrays","Convergence","Frequency","Antenna arrays","Noise generators","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Adaptive estimation","Applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1981","displayDocTitle":"Performance advantage of complex LMS for controlling narrow-band adaptive arrays","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance advantage of complex LMS for controlling narrow-band adaptive arrays","sourcePdf":"01085024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044073S","chronDate":"Jun 1981","isNumber":"23517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"55","articleId":"1085024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1085027,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The method permits incorporation of such realistic manufacturing constraints as tuning, correlation, and end-of-life performance specifications. Changes in design specifications and component cost models can be handled with minimal additional computational requirements. A database containing the results of a few hundred network analyses is first constructed. As the nominal values and tolerances are changed by the optimizer, each new yield and its gradient are evaluated by a new method called Parametric sampling without resorting to additional network analyses. Thus the most costly phase of statistical design,-statistical simulation, may be carried out only once, which leads to considerable computational efficiency. Equivalent or superior designs for intermediate size networks are obtained with less computational effort than previously published methods. For example, a worst-case design for an eleventh-order Chebychev filter gives a filter cost of 44 units, a centered worst-case design reduces the cost to 18 units and statistical design using Parametric sampling further reduces the cost to 5 units (800 analyses, 75 CPU seconds on an IBM 370/158).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1981","volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical design centering and tolerancing using parametric sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical design centering and tolerancing using parametric sampling","sourcePdf":"01085029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111842S","chronDate":"Jul 1981","isNumber":"23518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"104","articleId":"1085029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1085032,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The realization is based on recently introduced state-space structures and retains and enhances their low noise and sensitivity properties while reducing the number-of-required multiplications. This permits the implementation of higher order optimal forms requiring only 1.34 to 1.65 times the number of multiplications used in the direct form (well known for 'its poor coefficient sensitivity and high output noise levels). The high inherent parallelism of the state-space structure is also further enhanced by the proposed fast digital filter (FDF). The resulting block-processing algorithm is suitable for high speed implementation of digital filters on parallel processing systems. These systems employ fast and efficient techniques, such as distributed arithmetic or multimicroprocessor techniques, to perform the required computation of the long-independent inner products. In addition to low quantization noise, the FDF structure has other desirable properties including low sensitivity and improved limit cycle behavior. For output decimating IIR filters additional savings in the number of multiplications is achieved with the proposed structure.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1981.1085032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23518/01085032.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1981.1085032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23518","startPage":"716","endPage":"723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Digital Filters with Low Round-Off Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Digital Filters with Low Round-Off Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1981","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Digital Filters with Low Round-Off Noise","sourcePdf":"01085032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056677S","chronDate":"Jul 1981","isNumber":"23518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"39","articleId":"1085032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1085035,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Since the ACS problem is a binary decision problem, then the choice of the PI is equivalent to the selection of a decision function which measures the impact of each contingency on the system performance in terms of giving out-of-limit conditions. This paper shows how to select the set of weighting coefficients in the currently used PI's for analyzing either the real power flow or node voltage magnitude problems in order to circumvent some of the contingency ranking problems. Even more important, it is shown how to select the threshold values of the PI which guarantee proper classification of the contingencies in terms of minimizing the probabilities of missing critical contingencies and false alarms. The approach taken is a set theoretic one which allows us to develop a method for finding the PI as a volume maximization problem which can be solved using standard SUMT methods. One such algorithm is given together with an illustrative example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The application of decision theory to contingency selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of decision theory to contingency selection","sourcePdf":"01085092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028896S","chronDate":"Nov 1982","isNumber":"23523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1085092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1085105,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A new approach to design centering will be presented, which starts at the initial nominal values of the circuit parameters and improves these nominal values by maximizing the circuit yield step by step with the aid of a yield prediction formula. Using a variance prediction formula additionally, the yield maximization process can be established with a few iteration steps only, whereby a compromise between the yield improvement and the decrease in statistical certainty must be made in each step. A high-quality interactive optimization method is described which allows a quantitative problem diagnosis. The yield prediction formula is an analytical approximation based on the importance sampling relation. This relation can also be used to reduce the sample size of the necessary Monte Carlo analyses. Finally the efficiency of the presented algorithm will be demonstrated on a switched-capacitor filter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design centering by yield prediction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1982.1085115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23525/01085115.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1982.1085115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1982","displayDocTitle":"Design centering by yield prediction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"February 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design centering by yield prediction","sourcePdf":"01085115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066778S","chronDate":"Feb 1982","isNumber":"23525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1085115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1085118,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Unlike conventional techniques, however, our approach imposes no severe restriction on either the degree of nonlinearity, or the amplitude of oscillation. Moreover, the accuracy of the solution can be determined by a constructive algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1982.1085129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23526/01085129.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"168","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1982.1085129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear oscillation via Volterra series","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1982","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear oscillation via Volterra series","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear oscillation via Volterra series","sourcePdf":"01085129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045763S","chronDate":"Mar 1982","isNumber":"23526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1085129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1085130,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Subsequently a definition is given of a stationary deterministic signal. Based on this definition the notion of stationary systems is introduced. These systems have the useful property that the spectral relation between input and output has a simpler form than the corresponding relation for arbitrary time-varying systems. It is shown that causality puts rather severe constraints on the frequency mappings that can be realized by stationary linear systems. An extension of the theory of linear time-varying systems to the case of discrete-time and hybrid systems (analog input, digital output, or vice versa) is discussed. Examples of stationary systems are given, such as a decimator, a periodic sampler, and a bilinear A/D converter. Also, a recently proposed generalized sampling method is analyzed by means of the concepts discussed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1982","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On stationary linear time-varying systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On stationary linear time-varying systems","sourcePdf":"01085130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031172S","chronDate":"Mar 1982","isNumber":"23526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"94","articleId":"1085130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1085142,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The resistance variations are classified into a statistically random variation component and a deterministic variation component.

An autocorrelation technique was used to identify and separate several resistance variation components in the string.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for physical realizability of mid-series or mid-shunt nondissipative low-pass ladders without mutual induction are presented here and the complete proof is given. The essence of the conditions imposed upon the input impedance of the network terminated in a pure resistance is a relation between the finite frequencies at which the loss is infinite and the roots of a polynomial which appears in the rational fractional representation of the input impedance. The method used is the ladder development of a two-terminal impedance which is elementary in network synthesis. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for physical realizability of general low-pass ladders without mutual induction, which is wider than the above conditions, is also given. This paper is concerned with the realization problem of a dissipative two-terminal impedance by means of a nondissipative two-terminal-pair network without mutual induction terminated in a pure resistance. The above-mentioned conditions are also necessary and sufficient in order that a dissipative two-terminal impedance can be realized by means of a mid-series or mid-shunt nondissipative low-pass ladder without mutual induction terminated in a pure resistance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1955","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1955","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1955","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Realizability Theorem for Mid-series of Mid-shunt Low-pass Ladders Without Mutual Induction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizability Theorem for Mid-series of Mid-shunt Low-pass Ladders Without Mutual Induction","sourcePdf":"01085261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027451S","chronDate":"Dec 1955","isNumber":"23536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"29","articleId":"1085261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1085270,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper offers a new synthesis of this kind without mutual induction and its application to the design of uhf filters having Tchebyscheff characteristics in both pass and attenuation bands. The synthesis problem treated here is, in other words, the analog of the so-called Darlington problem in conventional lumped constant networks. Approximation procedures for filter characteristics are based on the well-known potential analogy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1955","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085270/","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1955","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Transmission-Line Networks and the Design of UHF Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Transmission-Line Networks and the Design of UHF Filters","sourcePdf":"01085270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073219S","chronDate":"Dec 1955","isNumber":"23536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"55","articleId":"1085270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1085281,"authors":[{"name":"H.

That problem requires the matching of a complex generator impedance to a complex load over a frequency band. The analytic solution is fundamental to understanding theoretical gain-bandwidth performance of systems but introduces severe difficulties when employed in design practice. Following the analytic presentation a CAD technique [the Real Frequency method] which bypasses the analytic theory and its difficulties of implementation is discussed. Various examples comparing the Real Frequency method to the analytic procedure are examined, It is shown that for double matching problems (as for single matching problems) the analytic method generally yields suboptimal performance characteristics. Thus just as in single matching problems, the Real Frequency method for double matching compared to the analytic procedure gives superior equalizer performance, simpler equalizer structures, and also is applicable to problems where the analytic method is virtually impossible to implement. As a final example the Real Frequency method is applied to the design of a two-stage microwave FET amplifier including input, output, and interstage equalizers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Impedance","Equalizers","Performance analysis","Power generation","Transfer functions","Design automation","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave FETs","Microwave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Impedance-matching","Linear passive and active networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCS.1983.1085281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23537/01085281.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1983.1085281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The double matching problem: Analytic and real frequency solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The double matching problem: Analytic and real frequency solutions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085281/","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The double matching problem: Analytic and real frequency solutions","sourcePdf":"01085281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050238S","chronDate":"Jan 1983","isNumber":"23537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"113","articleId":"1085281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1085282,"authors":[{"name":"C.-A.

By incorporating this optimization method into a tree search algorithm and employing a suitable branching policy, an efficient algorithm for the design of high-order discrete coefficient FIR filters is produced. This approach can also be used to design FIR filters on a minimax basis. The minimax criterion is approximated by adjusting the least squares weighting.

An iteration scheme to solve the fault diagnosis equations is proposed and is shown to be locally convergent. A sample diagnosis problem and solution concludes the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1983","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Analog multifrequency fault diagnosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog multifrequency fault diagnosis","sourcePdf":"01085352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063942S","chronDate":"Apr 1983","isNumber":"23543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1085352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1085356,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The RKHS's used for the above purpose are the \"arbitrarily weighted Fock spaces\" introduced by de Figueiredo and Dwyer in II] and called in the present paper \"generalized Fock (GF) spaces\". These spaces consist of polynomials or power series in one or more scalar variables, or of finite (polynomic case) or infinite Volterra functional series in one or more functions, or of finite or infinite Volterra operator series in one or more functions. In each case, the space is equipped with an appropriate weighted inner product, with the option of making the choice of weights depend on the particular problem under consideration.

Common intuition suggests that when a circuit is off synchronization the observed output, although not periodic, will be a sum of periodic (intermodulation) components. In fact, at least for a large class of systems we have studied, the output does not have this relatively simple form but is actually chaotic. This paper studies a simple but realistic model for a large class of triggered oscillators. Theory and experiments both confirm that the output shows the properties of sensitivity to initial conditions, nonperiodicity, broad spectrum, and complicated recurrence, that characterize chaotic motion.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1983.1085409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23548/01085409.pdf","endPage":"626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization and chaos","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1983.1085409","startPage":"620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1983","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization and chaos","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085409/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1983","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization and chaos","sourcePdf":"01085409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028492S","chronDate":"Sep 1983","isNumber":"23548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"79","articleId":"1085409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1085417,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Initially, computer-aided circuit analysis of linear circuits was used in design optimization, design centering, and in determining the effects of parasitics on circuit performance. Although this use of computer-aided circuit analysis has continued, computer-aided design (CAD) and circuit design automation within the CAS Society are now principally concerned with problems associated with the overall design and evaluation of very large circuits and systems. This paper is a review of a major thread of CAD activity which has occurred within CAS from the earliest and remains of major interest. This thread involves computer-aided circuit analysis (circuit simulation) and its use in CAD systems. Fortunately, several excellent review papers have appeared within the past year or two to document well the technical milestones, as well as the problems of interest at the present time. It is possible then, in this paper, to concentrate on the developments in our present capability of circuit simulators, stressing the significant trends, noting some early developments which did not become major aspects, and observing the interchange between theory and practice.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1984.1085422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23549","startPage":"103","endPage":"111","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23549/01085422.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A historical review of circuit simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1984","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A historical review of circuit simulation","publicationDate":"January 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A historical review of circuit simulation","sourcePdf":"01085422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050762S","chronDate":"Jan 1984","isNumber":"23549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1085422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1085423,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The realization algorithm is extremely simple to implement, particularly for Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Elliptic Selective Filters.

A bifurcation diagram composed by the sets of bifurcation values exhibits various nonlinear phenomena, such as the coexistence of several periodic responses which are correlated with the jump and hysteresis behaviors, the frequency entrainment, the appearance of quasi-periodic responses and chaotic states, etc. In engineering application the bifurcation diagram can be used for designing dynamic nonlinear circuit with prescribed characteristics. In this paper, we present some computational algorithms which determine the bifurcation values of periodic responses. Our algorithms are based on the geometric approach of ordinary differential equations. Newton's method is effectively used for finding the bifurcation value. The Jacobian matrix is evaluated by the solutions of variational equations. Numerical examples for the second-order systems are illustrated. Some global properties of bifurcation sets of periodic responses are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1984","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bifurcation of periodic responses in forced dynamic nonlinear circuits: Computation of bifurcation values of the system parameters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bifurcation of periodic responses in forced dynamic nonlinear circuits: Computation of bifurcation values of the system parameters","sourcePdf":"01085495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043067S","chronDate":"Mar 1984","isNumber":"23554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"205","articleId":"1085495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":1085496,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In the method the waveform of the interference is continuously estimated and subtracted from the measurement. The rejection properties are made independent of small variations in the fundamental frequency of the interference by fixing the sampling rate to be an exact multiple of it. Special attention is paid to the line frequency interference rejection problem where the notch at each harmonic is required to be very narrow although the sampling frequency is high if compared with the lowest notch frequency. Implementations using finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) discretetime filters are discussed. The proposed filters are shown to be easier to implement in wideband multiple notch applications than conventional and adaptive digital filters. A digital line frequency interference eliminator requiring only two multipliers has been constructed using an IIR filter. All of its 128 notches are 1-Hz wide and over 70-dB deep at 50 Hz and at its harmonics. The sampling frequency is 25.6 kHz and the available signal bandwidth is 6.4 kHz. The compensation of the low-frequency behavior of the digital IIR filter has been accomplished by combining appropriately analog filters with the digital part. The resulting frequency response with essentially linear phase characteristics starts from zero frequency. Through multiplexing the filter can also be used as a two- or four-channel system.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1984.1085529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1984.1085529","startPage":"438","endPage":"446","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23556/01085529.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic interference rejection using coherent sampling and waveform estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1984","displayDocTitle":"Periodic interference rejection using coherent sampling and waveform estimation","publicationDate":"May 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085529/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic interference rejection using coherent sampling and waveform estimation","sourcePdf":"01085529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045133S","chronDate":"May 1984","isNumber":"23556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1085529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1085542,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results are applied to the steady-state contingency analysis problem, resulting in a proposed new approach to the problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1984","volume":"31","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of linearized decoupled power flow approximations for steady-state security assessment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of linearized decoupled power flow approximations for steady-state security assessment","sourcePdf":"01085559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055094S","chronDate":"Jul 1984","isNumber":"23558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1085559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1085562,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Sheu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and the Electronics Research Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Bing Sheu","id":"37338835800"},{"name":"D.

It is simple, accurate, and suitable for circuit simulation applications. Charge conservation is guaranteed by using charge as the state variable. The partitioning of channel charge into drain and source components is given significant attention. This partitioning changes smoothly from 40/60 in the saturation region asymptotically to 50/50 in the triode region. The terminal charges are well behaved over all regions of operation. This charge model and its dc characteristic counterpart, derived from the same considrerations of MOS device physics, form a unified model previously unavailable.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1984.1085562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23559/01085562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1984.1085562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23559","startPage":"745","endPage":"748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact IGFET charge model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A compact IGFET charge model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact IGFET charge model","sourcePdf":"01085562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106534S","chronDate":"Aug 1984","isNumber":"23559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1085562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1085583,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The first is that any time-invariant (TI) continuous nonlinear operator can be approximated by a Volterra series operator, and the second is that the approximating operator can be realized as a finite-dimensional linear dynamical system with a nonlinear readout map. While previous approximation results are valid over finite time intervals and for signals in compact sets, the approximations presented here hold for all time and for signals in useful (noncompact) sets. The discretetime analog of the second theorem asserts that any TI operator with fading memory can be approximated (in our strong sense) by a nonlinear moving- average operator.

The procedure is based on the generation of a sequence of all pass matrices of successively decreasing order, by matrix LBR two-pair extraction. Two cases are distinguished: the first case is when none of the intermediate allpass matrices is degenerate. For this case, the resulting structures are in the form of a cascade of matrix two-pairs separated by vector delays, with each two-pair being a multi-input multi-output digital filter structure characterized by an orthogonal transfer matrix of dimension\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(m + p) \\times ( m + p)</tex>\n. The structures are in general either completely controllable or completely observable, depending upon the location of the delay elements. The synthesis technique also leads to a procedure for obtaining the greatest common right divisor between the polynomial matrices involved in the MFD. The results are extended to the cascaded-lattice synthesis of arbitrary stable transfer matrices by an embedding process. The developments of this paper automatically place in evidence a procedure for testing the stability of a transfer matrix.

The procedure is based on the sequential selection of two complex scalar parameters-an eigenvector parameter that determines the natural modes of the system, and a scaling parameter that determines the coupling of the natural modes to the input and output. For the realization of a digital filter, these parameters can be chosen to provide minimal computational complexity and low sensitivity to the undesirable finite word effects of fixed-point arithmetic. It is shown that it is possible to construct many state-space realizations that require the same number of multiplications as the canonical direct form, but which can have low sensitivity to roundoff error, low sensitivity to coefficient quantization, and immunity to overflow limit cycles. The realization procedure is illustrated by a numerical example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085756/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1985","volume":"32","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1985","displayDocTitle":"A parametric approach to the realization of second-order digital filter sections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parametric approach to the realization of second-order digital filter sections","sourcePdf":"01085756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02913S","chronDate":"Jun 1985","isNumber":"23569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1085756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1085761,"authors":[{"name":"Hae-Seung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hae-Seung Lee","id":"37280132400"},{"name":"D.

It is third order, reciprocal, and has only one nonlinear element: a 3-segment piecewise-linear resistor. Extensive laboratory measurements from this circuit and a detailed geometrical analysis and computer simulation reveal the following rather intricate \"anatomy\" of the associated strange attractor. In addition to a microscopically infinite sheet-like composition the attractor has a macroscopic \"double-scroll\" structure, i.e., two sheetlike objects are curled up together into spiral forms with infinitely many rotations. (See frontispiece.) The chaotic nature of this circuit is further confirmed by calculating its associated Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension. The double-scroll attractor has one positive, one zero and one negative Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov dimension turns out to be a fractal between 2 and 3 which agrees with the observed structures. The power spectra of the three associated state variables obtained by both measurement and computer simulation show a continuous broad spectrum typical of chaotic systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1985.1085791","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23571/01085791.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1985.1085791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The double scroll","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1985","displayDocTitle":"The double scroll","volume":"32","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The double scroll","sourcePdf":"01085791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037658S","chronDate":"Aug 1985","isNumber":"23571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"429","articleId":"1085791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1085795,"authors":[{"name":"Hon Kwan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Hon Kwan","id":"37270884600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-4094"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1276"}],"articleNumber":"1085795","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Very large scale integration","Transfer functions","Chebyshev approximation","Band pass filters","Circuits and systems","Finite wordlength effects","Delay","Adders","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital filters","Multiport circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085795","abstract":"A multi-output first-order digital filter structure is presented.

Ultimate limits to achievable filter performance, however, stem from factors more fundamental than op amp nonidealities, factors independent of process and circuit improvements. This paper develops, from certain basic assumptions, ultimate limits on dynamic range, chip area, and power consumption in SC integrators and low-pass filters. For integrators, minimum area and power requirements are shown to vary as the square of desired dynamic range. Some physically realistic approximations lead to expressions relating filter area, power consumption, and dynamic range which involve only fundamental process parameters, supply voltage and filter cut-off frequency. Comparison with actual performance in typical commercially manufactured SC filters suggests that there is still a strong motivation in improving op amp specifications.

The computational costs of different implementation techniques employing high-speed convolution algorithms such as fast Fourier transform, number theoretic transform and polynomial transform have been studied. A comparison among the relative efficiencies of these implementation schemes is made and a suitable method is then proposed using short convolution algorithm which results in a minimized computational time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085827/","volume":"33","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional block processors - Structures and implementations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional block processors - Structures and implementations","sourcePdf":"01085827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051036S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"23573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"40","articleId":"1085827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1085832,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A new sampled data Fourier transform is introduced which retains information about the sampling instants.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1986.1085854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1986.1085854","startPage":"933","endPage":"938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23574/01085854.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Almost periodic extension of band-limited functions and its application to nonuniform sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1986","displayDocTitle":"Almost periodic extension of band-limited functions and its application to nonuniform sampling","publicationDate":"October 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"33","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085854/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Almost periodic extension of band-limited functions and its application to nonuniform sampling","sourcePdf":"01085854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028591S","chronDate":"Oct 1986","isNumber":"23574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1085854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1085856,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The study is based on a model consisting of the classical swing equation characterization for generators and constant admittance, PV bus and/or PQ bus load representations which, in general, leads to a semi-explicit (or constrained) system of differential equations. A precise definition of static stability is given and basic concepts of static bifurcation theory are used to show that this definition does include conventional notions of steady-state stability and voltage collapse, but it provides a basis for rigorous analysis. Static bifurcations of the load flow equations are analyzed using the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction and Taylor series expansion of the resulting reduced bifurcation equation. These procedures have been implemented using symbolic computation (in MASYMA). It is shown that static bifurcations of the load flow equations are associated with either divergence-type instability or loss of causality. Causality issues are found to be an important factor in understanding voltage collapse and play a central role in organizing global power system dynamics when loads other than constant admittance are present.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1986.1085856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23574/01085856.pdf","startPage":"981","endPage":"991","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1986.1085856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static bifurcations in electric power networks: Loss of steady-state stability and voltage collapse","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1986","displayDocTitle":"Static bifurcations in electric power networks: Loss of steady-state stability and voltage collapse","volume":"33","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static bifurcations in electric power networks: Loss of steady-state stability and voltage collapse","sourcePdf":"01085856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044343S","chronDate":"Oct 1986","isNumber":"23574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"207","articleId":"1085856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":1085859,"authors":[{"name":"C.-S.

Our approach is to derive a linearly equivalent class of piecewise-linear differential equations which includes the double scroll as a special case. A necessary and sufficient condition for two such piecewise-linear vector fields to be linearly equivalent is that their respective eigenvalues be a scaled version of each other. In the special case where they are identical, we have exact equivalence in the sense of linear conjugacy. An explicit normalform equation in the context of global bifurcation is derived and parametrized by their eigenvalues. Analytical expressions for various Poincar\u00e9 maps are then derived and used to characterize the birth and the death of the double scroll, as well as to derive an approximate one-dimensional map in analytic form which is useful for further bifurcation analysis. In particular, the analytical expressions characterizing various half-return maps associated with the Poincar\u00e9 map are used in a crucial way to prove the existence of a Shilnikov-type homoclinic orbit, thereby establishing rigorously the chaotic nature of the double scroll. These analytical expressions are also fundamental in our in-depth analysis of the birth (onset of the double scroll) and death (extinction of chaos) of the double scroll. The unifying theme throughout this paper is to analyze the double scroll system as an unfolding of a large family of piecewise-linear vector fields in\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R^3</tex>\n. Using this approach, we were able to prove that the chaotic dynamics of the double scroll is quite common, and is robust because the associated horseshoes predicted from Shilnikov's theorem are structurally stable. In fact, it is exhibited by a large family (in fact, infinitely many linearlyequivalent circuits) of vector fields whose associated piecewise-linear differential equations bear no resemblance to each other. It is therefore remarkable that the normalized eigenvalues, which is a local concept, completely determine the system's global qualitative behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085869/","volume":"33","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The double scroll family","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The double scroll family","sourcePdf":"01085869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031598S","chronDate":"November  1986","isNumber":"23575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"771","articleId":"1085869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1085870,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The results for the LMS algorithm show that the excess mean-square error due to floating-point arithmetic increases inversely to loop gain for errors introduced by the summation in the weight vector recursion. The calculation of the desired signal prediction and prediction error lead to an additive noise term as in the RLS algorithm.

A VLSI implementation is presented which incorporates design techniques of pipelining, parallelism and module replication. Furthermore, it is shown that modifications to the algorithm can be made based on the use of a high degree of parallelism yielding an efficient structure which relieves constraints for high-speed execution. The operations then rely on a simpler one-dimensional interpolator to form one of the building blocks of the two-dimensional interpolator.

We also show that a network which solves linear programming problems can be understood from the same concepts.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1986.1085953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23580/01085953.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1986.1085953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple 'neural' optimization networks: An A/D converter, signal decision circuit, and a linear programming circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1986","displayDocTitle":"Simple 'neural' optimization networks: An A/D converter, signal decision circuit, and a linear programming circuit","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple 'neural' optimization networks: An A/D converter, signal decision circuit, and a linear programming circuit","sourcePdf":"01085953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0373S","chronDate":"May 1986","isNumber":"23580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"2214","articleId":"1085953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":1085965,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Enhancement of the object is performed by employing a time-varying first-order 3-D planar-resonant recursive filter that is adapted via its coefficients at each time interval to correspond to the trajectory of the object. The trajectory of the object is determined at each time interval by tracking the intensity centroid of the object at the output of the adaptive 3-D recursive filter. The system is initialized for tracking by a seek algorithm which searches the image for the first candidate object having uniform motion and intensity.

Optimization of individual time-varying convergence factors leads to a constraint which may be satisfied by several different algorithms. We propose and investigate here two algorithms satisfying the above constraint: individual adaptation (IA) and homogeneous adaptation (HA). The HA algorithm turns out to have the general form as some well known gradient algorithms that normalize the step size which were previously obtained either intuitively or using involved derivations. Both IA and HA are shown to provide much better performance than the conventional \"group\" adaptation. However, for several simulations, IA provides better performance than HA, at the expense of increased computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive filters with individual adaptation of parameters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive filters with individual adaptation of parameters","sourcePdf":"01085982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045463S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"23582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"96","articleId":"1085982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1085987,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This charge redistribution effect can destroy the noise margin and cause glitches at the output of a domino gate. This paper deals with circuit and layout techniques which can help in alleviating the problem. A simple analytical noise margin model for domino gates is discussed. The model is useful to monitor the noise margins of a domino gate while dimensioning the devices in the gate to obtain a specified gate delay. A new technique which allows the design of domino gates with a very large fan-in (typically 20 or more inputs), while maintaining good noise margins and acceptable gate delays, is presented. This technique is useful in, for example, decoder circuits.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1986.1085987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23583/01085987.pdf","endPage":"793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge redistribution and noise margins in domino CMOS logic","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1986.1085987","startPage":"786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1986","displayDocTitle":"Charge redistribution and noise margins in domino CMOS logic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085987/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1986","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge redistribution and noise margins in domino CMOS logic","sourcePdf":"01085987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027208S","chronDate":"Aug 1986","isNumber":"23583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1085987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1085988,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper expands on the previous idea by providing more general conditions for both nonzero output power and 100-percent efficiency at any number of harmonics in the output power. The load network and load are assumed to be passive and linear. It is shown that it is not possible to achieve both nonzero output power and 100-percent efficiency. In switching-mode circuits, it is not possible to eliminate both the transistor turnon switching loss and the transistor turnoff switching loss while obtaining nonzero output power; at least one of the switching losses must be nonzero at nonzero output power. The results presented here are useful in synthesis and analysis of high-efficiency power amplifiers and frequency multipliers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Frequency","Power harmonic filters","Switching loss","Switches","Power system harmonics","Voltage","Filtering","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power conversion","Frequency conversion","Harmonic distortion","Power amplifiers","Power conversion, AC-DC","Switching amplifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCS.1986.1085989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23583/01085989.pdf","startPage":"805","endPage":"807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1986.1085989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalization of conditions for 100% efficiency and nonzero output power in power amplifiers and frequency multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1085989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalization of conditions for 100% efficiency and nonzero output power in power amplifiers and frequency multipliers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1085989/","volume":"33","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalization of conditions for 100% efficiency and nonzero output power in power amplifiers and frequency multipliers","sourcePdf":"01085989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024215S","chronDate":"Aug 1986","isNumber":"23583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1085989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1085993,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The method is based on the computation of an eigenvector of an appropriate real, symmetric, and positive-definite matrix. The proposed design procedure is general enough to incorporate both time- and frequency-domain constraints. For example, Nyquist filters can be easily designed using this approach. The design time for the new method is comparable to that of Remez exchange techniques. The passband and stopband errors in the frequency domain can be made equiripple by an iterative process, which involves feeding back the approximation error at each iteration.

It is shown that, although OBA and OBAS require a relatively modest increase in computation for each block iteration compared to the existing block least-mean-square (BLMS) algorithm, OBA and OBAS may be found in some applications more computationally efficient due to the considerable reduction in the number of iterations required for a given adaptation accuracy. A comparison between the OBAS algorithm and the recently proposed fast a posteriori error sequential technique (FAEST) is also conducted for adapting to time-varying (unknown) systems, and the results show that OBAS is superior to the FAEST algorithm with respect to speed and accuracy of adaptation, at least for the variety of filters used in the simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast algorithms for block FIR adaptive digital filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast algorithms for block FIR adaptive digital filtering","sourcePdf":"01086047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043969S","chronDate":"October  1987","isNumber":"23586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1086047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1086048,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, we show that adaptive filters can be implemented in an area-efficient manner by first using pipelining to the maximum possible extent, and then using block processing in combination with pipelining if further increase in sampling rate is needed. We show that, with the use of a decomposition technique, high-speed realizations can be achieved using pipelining with a logarithmic increase in hardware (the block realizations require a linear increase in hardware). We derive pipelined word-parallel realizations of high-sampling-rate adaptive lattice filters using the techniques of look-ahead computation decomposed state update implementation, and incremental output computation. These three techniques combined make it possible to achieve asymptotically optimal complexity realizations (i.e., the same complexity asymptotically as nonrecursive systems) of high-speed adaptive lattice filters (in both bit-serial and bit-parallel methodologies) and provide a \"system solution\" to high-speed adaptive filtering. The adaptive lattice filter structures are ideal for high-sampling-rate implementations, since the error residuals of a particular stage are adapted order-recursively based on those of the previous stage, and the coefficient update recursion inside each stage is linear in nature. An example of a normalized stochastic gradient adaptive lattice filter is presented, and its complexity, latency, and implementation methodology tradeoffs are studied.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1987.1086048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23586/01086048.pdf","startPage":"1141","endPage":"1151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1987.1086048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent cellular VLSI adaptive filter architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1987","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent cellular VLSI adaptive filter architectures","volume":"34","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent cellular VLSI adaptive filter architectures","sourcePdf":"01086048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038316S","chronDate":"Oct 1987","isNumber":"23586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"66","articleId":"1086048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086053,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The main aspects of the system are: knowledge representation, with 3-D and 2-D aspects for anatomical description; error recovery and conflict resolution facilities at different backtracking levels; and a general system structure easy to extend to other application fields. Production rules are employed in order to define the criteria for deciding what action is to be performed on the basis of the current problem status. However, in order to obtain a more explicit and appropriate representation, anatomical knowledge has not been spread throughout the production rules, but it has been incorporated into an extended semantic network that well represents relational properties. The control structure consults production rules and, according to their content, activates the various processing procedures in order to attain the recognition goal. A strategy is applied that can be driven by data or models, depending on the processing phase and on progressive results. Applications of the system to different patients and slices are described and discussed. The importance of the paper lies basically in the methodological approach to image processing and interpretation, and in possible interesting applications to the medical field.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23587/01086063.pdf","startPage":"1399","endPage":"1416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A knowledge-based system for biomedical image processing and recognition","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1987.1086063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1987.1086063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1086063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1987","displayDocTitle":"A knowledge-based system for biomedical image processing and recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A knowledge-based system for biomedical image processing and recognition","sourcePdf":"01086063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075674S","chronDate":"Nov 1987","isNumber":"23587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"45","articleId":"1086063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1086064,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The objects and models are represented by regions that are a collection of surface patches homogeneous in certain intrinsic surface properties. The recognition scheme is based on matching object surface descriptions with model surface descriptions. The recognition task includes both locating the overall object and identifying its features. Location is achieved by finding a geometrical registration function that correctly superimposes an arbitrary instance of the known model and the model. A localization technique is presented which requires that correspondence be established exactly, between one point on the object surface and one on the model surface. Once the single point correspondence is specified, closed-form solutions are given for determining the attitude of the unknown view of the object in 3 space with respect to the model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086070/","volume":"34","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Representation and recognition of objects from dense range maps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representation and recognition of objects from dense range maps","sourcePdf":"01086070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04151S","chronDate":"Nov 1987","isNumber":"23587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1086070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1086071,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The goal of image coding is to reduce this number as much as possible, and to reconstruct a faithful duplicate of the original picture. Early efforts in image coding, solely guided by information theory, led to a plethora of methods. The compression ratio reached a plateau of about 10:1 several years ago. Recent progress in the study of the brain mechanism of vision and of scene analysis has opened new vistas in picture coding. The concept of directional sensitivity of neurones in the visual cortex combined with the separate processing of contours and textures has led to a new class of coding methods, called second generation, capable of achieving compression ratios as high as 100:1. In this paper, recent results on object-based coding methods are reported, exhibiting improvements in the previous second-generation methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent results in high-compression image coding (Invited Papaer)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1987.1086071","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23587/01086071.pdf","startPage":"1306","endPage":"1336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1987.1086071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1086071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1987","displayDocTitle":"Recent results in high-compression image coding (Invited Papaer)","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"November 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent results in high-compression image coding (Invited Papaer)","sourcePdf":"01086071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047364S","chronDate":"Nov 1987","isNumber":"23587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"162","articleId":"1086071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086075,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Using a formulation based on unitary transforms and all-pass functions, we obtain analysis and synthesis filter banks which are related through a transposition operation, such that the cascade of analysis and synthesis filter banks achieves an all-pass function. The simplest structure is obtained using a Hadamard transform, which is shown to correspond to a binary tree structure. Tree structures can be generated for a variety of other unitary transforms as well. In addition, given a tree-structured filter bank where the number of bands is a power of two, simple methods are developed to generate complementary filter banks with an arbitrary number of channels, which retain the transpose relationship between analysis and synthesis banks, and allow for any combination of bandwidths. The structural properties of the filter banks are illustrated with design examples, and multirate applications are outlined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Tree-structured complementary filter banks using all-pass sections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-structured complementary filter banks using all-pass sections","sourcePdf":"01086086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106158S","chronDate":"Dec 1987","isNumber":"23588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1086086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1086088,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The voltage-collapse phenomenon is modeled as a large deviation in the nonlinear dynamics of the system, driven by small magnitude, broad spectrum disturbances in load.

The security measure indicating vulnerability to voltage collapse is based on expected exit time from the region of attraction for the stable operating point.

The time constant characterizing the exponential increase of the oscillation amplitude is determined by a small-signal analysis of the resonant circuit, and the dependence of this time constant on circuit parameters is examined. Calculation of the initial value of currents and voltages generated when power is applied to the inverter is explained. Oscillator start-up under various conditions is analyzed and different types of resonators are taken into account. The total oscillator starting time can be determined from the present work. Results of experimental work carried out on the oscillator of the microprocessor MC68HC04P3 with ceramic and quartz resonators agree well with the calculated values. Oscillograms illustrate how the start-up occurs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23590/01086137.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1987.1086137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1987.1086137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1086137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Start-up time of CMOS oscillators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Equivalent circuits","Voltage","Capacitance","RLC circuits","CMOS technology","Equations","Inverters","Inductance","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOSFET oscillators","Oscillator circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1987","displayDocTitle":"Start-up time of CMOS oscillators","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Start-up time of CMOS oscillators","sourcePdf":"01086137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074734S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1086137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086149,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is, in fact, a rediscovery of earlier work [29]. The QRNS is obtained from a mapping of Gaussian integers over a finite ring to a ring of conjugate elements. This conjugate ring has the remarkable property that both addition and multiplication are performed componentwise. The operations are performed over subrings, isomorphic to the conjugate ring, and the results are mapped to the conjugate ring via the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). The QRNS has since been generalized for any type of moduli set, with an inherent dynamic range reduction, and has been termed the quadratic-like residue number system (QLRNS) [7]. An alternate form removes the dynamic range reduction but requires an increase in multiplications from two to three; this system has been termed the modified quadratic residue number system (MQRNS) [3], [4]. This tutorial paper is a companion to another paper in this special issue [32]; it consolidates work on quadratic system implementations, with special emphasis on the modified system. The paper discusses, in some detail, the quadratic implementation of the two forms of complex convolution, which are naturally defined over finite rings, or fields, and which incur no scaling overhead. A new notation is introduced that eliminates confusion over the several mappings that are required in the quadratic representation, and initial work on the implementation of finite ring computational elements, suitable for VLSI fabrication, is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086155/","volume":"34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1987","displayDocTitle":"Complex digital signal processing over finite rings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex digital signal processing over finite rings","sourcePdf":"01086155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043159S","chronDate":"Apr 1987","isNumber":"23591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"29","articleId":"1086155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1086156,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, the chip area grows exponentially with the number of bits in the input. In this paper a new architecture which is equivalent to the threshold decomposition is shown to have linear growth in the size of the input words. Filtering is accomplished by a pipelined bit by bit algorithm. Hardware modifications to the filtering scheme are accomplished by changing data paths and the number of cells to be replicated rather than modifying the functions performed by each module. Hardware redundancy to prevent single points of failure can be provided when space for extra modules is available. If external data flow control is provided, the chip can be programmed for many different filtering operations. The basic representation of the generalized rank order filter as a maximum of minimums also provides a fast software implementation and intuitive description of these filters as adaptive rank operations. Because the threshold description is extremely slow on a general-purpose computer, this is essential for investigating new applications of these robust signal and image processing filters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23592/01086165.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1987.1086165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1987.1086165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1086165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software and VLSI algorithms for generalized ranked order filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Software algorithms","Filtering algorithms","Computer architecture","Hardware","Adaptive filters","Application software","Robustness","Signal processing","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Digital filters","Median filters","Pipeline processing","VLSI","Very large-scale integration (VLSI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1987","displayDocTitle":"Software and VLSI algorithms for generalized ranked order filtering","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software and VLSI algorithms for generalized ranked order filtering","sourcePdf":"01086165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058013S","chronDate":"May 1987","isNumber":"23592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"46","articleId":"1086165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1086169,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The principle is to perform a preliminary charge transfer operation preceding every desired charge transfer operation, thus obtaining a close approximation of the finite gain error which is stored and subsequently used for correction. This provides excellent suppression of the finite gain effect, independent of the relationship between the clock rate and the signal frequencies. The technique is quite general in nature and can be applied in a wide variety of switchedcapacitor circuits. Its major applications will be in precision analog signal processing circuits like precision amplifiers, A/D and D/A converters, and analog arithmetic building blocks. Simulation studies indicate that this technique has the potential to reduce the amplifier gain requirements in such circuits by one to two orders of magnitude. This would simplify amplifier design and increase the high-frequency capability of these circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1987","publicationDate":"May 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"34","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Switched-capacitor circuits with reduced sensitivity to amplifier gain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-capacitor circuits with reduced sensitivity to amplifier gain","sourcePdf":"01086170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123694S","chronDate":"May 1987","isNumber":"23592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"105","articleId":"1086170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086174,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is shown that due to the nonlinearity of the quantizer, the signal-to-noise ratio of the modulator may decrease as the input amplitude increases prior to saturation. Also, a stable third-order delta-sigma modulator may become unstable by increasing the input amplitude beyond a certain threshold.

RNS implementations have a highly modular structure, and are not dependent upon large binary arithmetic elements. RNS implementations become more attractive when combined with the advantages offered by VLSI fabrication technology. In this paper, a novel design methodology has been developed for RNS structures, based on using look-up tables, which takes into consideration the unique features and requirements of RNS. The paper discusses the following three phases: 1) developing a look-up table layout model, which is used to derive relationships between the size of each modulus and both chip area and time; this model supports all types of moduli; 2) selecting the most efficient layout according to the design requirements; the procedure allows the designer to control the area, time, or the configuration of the memory module required for implementing a modulo look-up table; 3) proposing a set of multi-look-up table modules, to be used as building block units for implementing digital signal-processing architectures.

The weighted output of the one beam, referred to as the interference beam, is subtracted from the other beam, referred to as the signal beam, which has a specified response in the signal direction. This paper presents an algorithm to adjust the complex weight of the interference channel iteratively, studies its convergence, presents an exact expression for the misadjustment, and compares the performance of this processor with that of an element space processor. The paper shows that in the absence of errors the performance of the two processors is identical but in the presence of the signal direction error the PIC processor performs better than the element space processor. Furthermore, the adaptive algorithm of the PIC needs to adjust only one complex weight per iteration, whereas in the element space processor the number of complex weights required to be updated at each iteration is equal to the number of elements in the array.","doi":"10.1109/TCS.1987.1086197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23594/01086197.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1987.1086197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"721","endPage":"730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust adaptive array processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1086197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1987","displayDocTitle":"A robust adaptive array processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086197/","volume":"34","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust adaptive array processor","sourcePdf":"01086197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026648S","chronDate":"Jul 1987","isNumber":"23594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1086197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1086200,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Performance degradations caused by limited-precision quantization of internal algorithmic quantities are often found to be much larger than what might be otherwise expected. Furthermore, in many cases, limited-precision errors are found to accumulate in time without bound, leading to an eventual overflow. This overflow is an unacceptable phenomenon in practice. Where possible, we list modifications to the infinite-precision design criteria which prevent the overflow at the expense of a small degradation from the performance that is achievable in infinite precision. We also delineate unacceptable numerical problems in some of the adaptive filtering algorithms for which no solution is yet ubiquitously accepted or useful. Stochastic gradient (LMS), recursive least squares (RLS), and frequencydomain methods are all discussed. As such, this paper contains a mixture of tutorial and novel material in an effort to assist the reader in the limited-precision implementation of an adaptive-filtering algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCS.1987.1086209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23594","startPage":"821","endPage":"833","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/23594/01086209.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited-precision effects in adaptive filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1987","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Limited-precision effects in adaptive filtering","publicationDate":"July 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited-precision effects in adaptive filtering","sourcePdf":"01086209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047963S","chronDate":"Jul 1987","isNumber":"23594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"179","articleId":"1086209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1086215,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The approach is an extension of the Kaiser-Hamming procedure [1] proposed for sharpening the response of an FIR filter. The new approach allows the subfilter and the tap coefficients to be simultaneously optimized to minimize either the number of subfilters for the given order of the subfilter or the subfilter order for the given number of subfilters. The optimization is based on the use of standard FIR filter design algorithms. Several examples demonstrate how the new approach leads to implementations requiring significantly fewer distinct multipliers than equivalent direct-form minimax FIR designs at the expense of a slight increase in the overall filter order. The number of distinct multipliers can be reduced to approximately\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\sqrt{2.6L}</tex>\n, where\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</tex>\nis the order of the direct-form minimax design. Alternatively, the design of the subfilter and tap coefficients can be separated. This makes it possible to construct the subfilter so that it roughly meets the overall specifications with a highly reduced number of arithmetic operations. In this case, the tap coefficients are optimized to minimize the required number of subfilters to meet the given criteria. Even multiplier-free designs can be obtained by carefully constructing the subfilter and determining the tap coefficients. Several structures are discussed for implementing the overall filter. These structures are compared with each other and with equivalent directform minimax designs in terms of the number of distinct multipliers, overall filter order, overall multiplication rate, number of delay elements, coefficient sensitivity, and output noise variance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of FIR filters as a tapped cascaded interconnection of identical subfilters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of FIR filters as a tapped cascaded interconnection of identical subfilters","sourcePdf":"01086263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038237S","chronDate":"September  1987","isNumber":"23596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"73","articleId":"1086263","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086268,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These theorems not only contain the nature of determination (unique-specification, over-specification, and underspecification) of signals but also include explicit reconstruction formulas. From the reconstruction formulas, the complexity and accuracy of the nonuniform sampling processes discussed can be estimated. In addition, these theorems lead to observations regarding the allowable shapes, the \"prediction,\" and the \"energy\" of bandwidth-limited signals in general. A \"minimum-energy\" signal is introduced which has certain advantages as compared to the ordinary \"time-limited\" signals when a finite number of sample values are given. Finally, a statement due to Cauchy on the sampling of bandwidth-limited signals is generalized to include a wider class of nonuniform sample point distributions and modified to give more exact information regarding the nature of determination of signals.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23600","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/23600/01086325.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1956.1086325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1956.1086325","startPage":"251","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Nonuniform Sampling of Bandwidth-Limited Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1956","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1956","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086325/","displayDocTitle":"On Nonuniform Sampling of Bandwidth-Limited Signals","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"December 1956","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Nonuniform Sampling of Bandwidth-Limited Signals","sourcePdf":"01086325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036265S","chronDate":"Dec 1956","isNumber":"23600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"378","articleId":"1086325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086328,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is the assignment of an integral value to a physical quantity corresponding to the nearest number of units contained in it. Quantization is like \"sampling-in-amplitude,\" which should be distinguished from the usual \"sampling-in-time.\" The probability density distribution of the signal is sampled in this case, rather than the signal itself. Quantized signals take on only discrete levels and have probability densities consisting of uniformly-spaced impulses. If the quantization is fine enough so that a Nyquist-sampling restriction upon the probability density is satisfied, statistics are recoverable from the grouped statistics in a way similar to the recovery of a signal from its samples. When statistics are recoverable, the nature of quantization \"noise\" is understood. As a matter of fact, it is known to be uniformly distributed between plus and minus half a unit, and it is entirely random (first order) even though the signal may be of a higher-order process, provided that a multidimensional Nyquist restriction on the high-order distribution density is satisfied. This simple picture of quantization noise permits an understanding of round-off error and its propagation in numerical solution, and of the effects of analog-to-digital conversion in closed-loop control systems. Application is possible when the grain size is almost two standard deviations. Here the dynamic range of a variable covers about three quantization boxes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1956","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1956","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086334/","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1956","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Rough Amplitude Quantization by Means of Nyquist Sampling Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Rough Amplitude Quantization by Means of Nyquist Sampling Theory","sourcePdf":"01086334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020087S","chronDate":"Dec 1956","isNumber":"23600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"167","articleId":"1086334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086360,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Practical negative-impedance converters are not exact; however, they may be made so by the addition of a pair of compensating impedances.

The intimate relationship becomes an indentity when we deal with Markoff probability diagrams, for which the circuit model of the problem and the flow-graph model of the problem are one and the same. 2) The expression for a flow-graph transmission in terms of the branch transmissions can often be made much more compact by a process called partial factoring. Fortunately, this process has a simple topological interpretation, so that the compact form is obtainable by inspection of the flow-graph. 3) Simultaneous linear matrix equations may be conveniently expressed in flow-graph form, whereupon the solution is obtainable by standard flow-graph reduction techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1957","publicationDate":"September 1957","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"About Such Things as Unistors, Flow Graphs, Probability, Partial Factoring, and Matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"About Such Things as Unistors, Flow Graphs, Probability, Partial Factoring, and Matrices","sourcePdf":"01086386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023363S","chronDate":"September  1957","isNumber":"23603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1086386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086387,"authors":[{"name":"L.

To permit maximum flexibility in the analysis and design of such structures, a complete specification of the characteristics of the negative impedance circuit is required. Four parameters are required for such a specification. The present discussion in terms of the ABCD matrix is particularly useful when a tandem connection of negative impedance circuits and passive networks is to be investigated. The behavior of a practical circuit can be represented as the sum of a matrix stating the ideal behavior and an error matrix. In the cases studied, the elements of the error matrix are inversely proportional to the gain of the amplifier used. Stability of an over-all circuit and sensitivity to component variations are expressed in terms of the elements of the scattering matrix.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23603","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/23603/01086388.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1957.1086388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1957.1086388","startPage":"132","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative Impedance Circuits--Some Basic Relations and Limitations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086388/","displayDocTitle":"Negative Impedance Circuits--Some Basic Relations and Limitations","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1957","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative Impedance Circuits--Some Basic Relations and Limitations","sourcePdf":"01086388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044019S","chronDate":"September  1957","isNumber":"23603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1086388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086411,"authors":[{"name":"E.

These are expressed in terms of the transistor two-port parameters and the elements of the neutralizing network. The influence of the network on the driving point immittances, maximum transducer gain, and stability can then be considered. (Unilateralization does not necessarily insure unconditional stability.) The effects of non-ideal transformers used for the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">z</tex>\nand\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</tex>\ntypes of neutralization are evaluated. Applications of these equations, over the frequency range from 30 to 80 mc, using measured parameters of the type 3N25 tetrode, are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23606","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/23606/01086446.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1958.1086446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1958.1086446","startPage":"95","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Transistor Neutralization Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1958","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086446/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Transistor Neutralization Networks","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1958","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Transistor Neutralization Networks","sourcePdf":"01086446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047013S","chronDate":"June  1958","isNumber":"23606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1086446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086452,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It shows how the characteristic function for cases of practical importance can be calculated, particularly for the special cases 1) where this function is a power term in the frequency variable (maximally flat), 2) where it is a Tchebycheff polynomial function, and 3) where the effective attenuation in both the pass band and the stop band is of Tchebycheff character, and, also for 4) the general case of Tchebycheff behavior in the pass band with prescribed attenuation poles. The way, and the separate steps, of the determination of the circuit-element values for the realization of reactance ladder-network filters without mutual inductances are indicated, and the various necessary computation formulas are described. For the first two special cases mentioned above, computation formulas applicable in general are given. New formulas are presented for the transformation of a low-pass into a band-pass configuration with a minimum number of inductances, and into a band-pass with the stray capacitance being taken into consideration. These are illustrated by several numerical examples. Next, the paper deals with the design of filters, taking into consideration additional requirements involving the group delay. Possibilities of solving the problem are described. An actual example, together with the measured results, illustrates the excellent agreement between the theoretical determination and the behavior of the filter constructed accordingly. The Appendix contains a selected section of a table which gives the normalized values of circuit elements for low-pass filters with the effective attenuation in the pass band and the stop band behaving in the Tchebycheff sense, for the degrees\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</tex>\n, and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</tex>\n.

These networks, made up of arbitrary interconnections of unit-delay elements (or of trigger flip-flops), modulo-p adders, and scalar multipliers (modulo\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\alpha</tex>\n, prime\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</tex>\n), are of importance in unconventional radar and communication systems, in automatic error-correction circuits, and in the control circuits of digital computers. In addition, these networks are of theoretical significance to the study of more general sequential networks. The basic problem with which this paper is concerned is that of finding economical realizations of such networks for prescribed autonomous (excitation-free) behavior. To this end, an analytical-algebraic model is described which permits the investigation of the relation between network logical structure and state-sequential behavior. This relation is studied in detail for nonsingular networks (those with purely cyclic behavior). Among the results of this investigation is the establishment of relations between the state diagram of the network and a characteristic polynomial derived from its logical structure, An operation of multiplication of state diagrams is shown to correspond to multiplication of the corresponding polynomials. A criterion is established for the realizability of prescribed cyclic behavior by means of linear autonomous sequential networks. An effective procedure for the economical realization of such networks is described, and it is shown that linear feedback shift registers constitute a canonical class of realizations. Examples are given of the realization procedure. The problem of synthesis with only one-cycle length specified is also discussed. A partial solution is obtained to this \"don't care\" problem. Some special families of feedback shift registers are investigated in detail, and the state-diagram structures are obtained for an arbitrary number of stages and an arbitrary (prime) modulus. Mathematical appendixes are included which summarize the pertinent results in Galois field theory and in the factorization of cyclotomic polynomials into irreducible factors over a modular field. The relation of the theory developed in this paper to Huffman's description of linear sequence transducers in terms of the D operator is discussed, as well as unsolved problems and directions for further generalization.","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","startPage":"45","endPage":"60","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1959.1086506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1959.1086506","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/23609/01086506.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Theory of Autonomous Linear Sequential Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1959","displayDocTitle":"The Theory of Autonomous Linear Sequential Networks","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1959","volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Theory of Autonomous Linear Sequential Networks","sourcePdf":"01086506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050634S","chronDate":"March  1959","isNumber":"23609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"186","articleId":"1086506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086509,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A similar correspondence is obtained between the topological operation of deleting a vertex from the flow graph and the algebraic operation of eliminating a variable from the set of equations. These results are derived from the algebraic equations written in terms of the incidence and weight matrices of the graph. They are similar to those given for the familiar Signal-Flow-Graph, although they are more convient to use, since the topological properties of the flow graph depend only upon the algebraic properties of the set of equations. A flow graph can be drawn directly from an electric network diagram, and the flow-graph properties, used to obtain a solution of the network equations. Examples of this for two types of feedback networks are shown.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23610","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/23610/01086537.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1959.1086537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1959.1086537","startPage":"170","endPage":"187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow-Graph Solutions of Linear Algebraic Equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086537/","displayDocTitle":"Flow-Graph Solutions of Linear Algebraic Equations","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow-Graph Solutions of Linear Algebraic Equations","sourcePdf":"01086537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04934S","chronDate":"June  1959","isNumber":"23610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"109","articleId":"1086537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1086554,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The amplifier is assumed to consist of n identical stages with the input and output terminations. The individual amplifier stage consists of a general active two-port device, such as the transistor, characterized by its four short-circuit admittance parameters, plus a two-terminal interstage network and an ideal coupling transformer. Both the individual amplifier stage and the over-all cascade of n amplifier stages, considered as a composite active two-port, are also characterized by their short-circuit admittance (Y) parameters. Relations between these Y parameters of the individual amplifier stage and the Y parameters of the over-all iterative amplifier have been derived. The transducer gain of the amplifier as a function of the interstage and the terminating network parameters has been studied. The transducer gain is optimized with respect to the external passive terminations and is expressed in terms of a design parameter\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\gamma</tex>\n, which is directly related to the terminating conductances of the amplifier. It is shown that for an amplifier employing inherently stable active devices, there is a value of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\gamma</tex>\nwhich gives maximum transducer power gain; for an amplifier employing potentially unstable active devices, the optimum transducer power gain of the amplifier will, in general, be a monotonically decreasing function of\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\gamma</tex>\n.

The single value of noise measure may be computed from any simple lossless circuit at hand, or else from the exchangeable noise power of the noisy negative resistance.","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1960.1086655","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/23615/01086655.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1960.1086655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise in Negative-Resistance Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1960","displayDocTitle":"Noise in Negative-Resistance Amplifiers","volume":"7","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086655/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1960","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise in Negative-Resistance Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"01086655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043882S","chronDate":"June  1960","isNumber":"23615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1086655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1086659,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The message which is to be sampled and transmitted is assumed to be a stationary random function of time and is not strictly bandlimited. The results presented here are more general than previous calculations because the message spectrum has an arbitrary cut-off rate, the sampling duration can be finite, and \"white\" noise is assumed introduced into the system by transmission. Filtering of the message before sampling is shown to allow a smaller minimum error than without such filtering, even though the error is determined with respect to the original unfiltered message. The transfer function of the optimum presampling filter is derived as well as the corresponding optimum smoothing filter.","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1960.1086679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1960.1086679","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/23616/01086679.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical Bounds on the Performance of Sampled Data Communications Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1086679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1960","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical Bounds on the Performance of Sampled Data Communications Systems","volume":"7","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical Bounds on the Performance of Sampled Data Communications Systems","sourcePdf":"01086679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021848S","chronDate":"Sep 1960","isNumber":"23616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1086679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1086720,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Input data consists of sets of two-port parameters measured over the frequency range of interest, a stability factor p and the desired bandwidth. Using these values, the computer calculates the values of all elements needed for a complete amplifier. The method is also applicable to multi-element configurations which can be viewed externally as a single unit, e.g., cascode circuits and partially neutralized amplifiers.

Various investigators have determined the network characteristics of rather complex distributed RC structures. It is the purpose of this paper to point out the effects of geometrical tapering on the characteristics of distributed RC structures. Uniform (untapered), exponential, and linear tapers are analyzed for the distributed RC line and for a distributed narrow-band-rejection filter. It is shown that tapering is useful for sharpening the cutoff of gain vs frequency for the RC line and it is also useful for narrowing the rejection band of the \"notch\" filter. Transient behavior of the RC line is also investigated.

An iterative solution is presented that is suitable for any class of robots having rotary or prismatic joints, with any arbitrary number of degrees of freedom, including both standard and kinematically redundant robots. The solution can be obtained subject to specified constraints and based on certain performance criteria.

This navigation system is based on a dynamically maintained model of the local environment, called the composite local model. The composite local model integrates information from the rotating range sensor, the robot's touch sensor, and a pre-learned global model as the robot moves through its environment. Techniques are described for constructing a line segment description of the most recent sensor scan (the sensor model), and for integrating such descriptions to build up a model of the immediate environment (the composite local model). The estimated position of the robot is corrected by the difference in position between observed sensor signals and the corresponding symbols in the composite local model. A learning technique is described in which the robot develops a global model and a network of places. The network of places is used in global path planning, while the segments are recalled from the global model to assist in local path execution. This system is useful for navigation in a finite, pre-learned domain such as a house, office, or factory.","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1985.1087002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23627/01087002.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1985.1087002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Navigation for an intelligent mobile robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1985","displayDocTitle":"Navigation for an intelligent mobile robot","volume":"1","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087002/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Navigation for an intelligent mobile robot","sourcePdf":"01087002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039199S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"321","articleId":"1087002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087003,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The scheme is applied to the parallel processing of dynamic control computation for the Stanford manipulator. In particular, the proposed algorithms are applied to the computation of the Newton-Euler equations of motion for the Stanford manipulator and implemented on a multimicroprocessor system.

With this arrangement, the torque that moves the third moving link is transmitted through a four-bar or five-bar linkage mechanism, which is a closed-chain structure having a planar motion. Although a variety of computational schemes for the input joint torques/forces of industrial robots having open-chain mechanisms can be found in the literature, an efficient method of computation for robots with closed kinematic chain mechanisms is not available. A computationally efficient scheme is presented for industrial robots having three-dimensional closed-chain linkages. First the closed-chain is virtually cut open, and the kinematics of the virtual open-chain mechanism are analyzed. The holonomic constraints are applied to the virtually cut joint. As a result, the spatial closed-chain linkage can be considered as a tree-structured open-chain mechanism with kinematic constraints. Based on the known recursive Newton-Euler formulation, a computational scheme is developed for industrial robots having three-dimensional closed kinematic chain mechanisms. Two examples are given illustrating the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087008/","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Computation of input generalized forces for robots with closed kinematic chain mechanisms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of input generalized forces for robots with closed kinematic chain mechanisms","sourcePdf":"01087008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049243S","chronDate":"Jun 1985","isNumber":"23628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"134","articleId":"1087008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087012,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These vehicles offer the potential of increased mobility for traversing rough terrain. The ability to maintain stability is an important consideration in the development of any control algorithm for a legged vehicle. Previous work on legged vehicle control generally assumes that the terrain is regular enough that only minimal operator interaction is necessary. However, for very irregular terrain the operator may require a guidance mode that gives maximum resolution and flexibility in controlling body, leg, position, and orientation. Several automatic body regulation schemes that aid the operator in this important task are described. A major development is the use of an improved stability measure which can be automatically optimized. This measure, together with a consideration of constraints on the kinematic limits of individual legs, leads to the development of schemes for automatic body regulation. The automatic body regulation schemes are incorporated into the vehicle control algorithm to provide a high degree of vehicle maneuverability while reducing the operator's burden.","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1985.1087012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23629/01087012.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1985.1087012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic body regulation for maintaining stability of a legged vehicle during rough-terrain locomotion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1985","displayDocTitle":"Automatic body regulation for maintaining stability of a legged vehicle during rough-terrain locomotion","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic body regulation for maintaining stability of a legged vehicle during rough-terrain locomotion","sourcePdf":"01087012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043192S","chronDate":"Sep 1985","isNumber":"23629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"151","articleId":"1087012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":1087018,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, determining range direction rather than just range magnitude is made difficult by the expanding signal beam of the sensor. This direction ambiguity can be reduced to some extent by increasing the operating frequency or diameter of the sensor, but some ambiguity will still remain. A technique is described for obtaining the true direction to a planar surface using three sensors or three positions of one sensor. A direct solution of the vector equation is discussed to illustrate the solution complexity in direct form. A simplifying transformation applied to the direct form and a further simplifying sensor configuration are described which greatly reduces the solution complexity. An alternate formulation of the problem is described from which a geometrical insight can be obtained. This alternate solution also lends itself to the generation of tangential constraint surfaces for bounding curved object surfaces. These local feature extraction techniques are extended to perform surface tracking for the extraction of global surface features. The connectivity of local features provides additional information. From this information classification of solid objects is possible.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23630/01087022.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"205","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1985.1087022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1985.1087022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature extraction techniques for recognizing solid objects with an ultrasonic range sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1985","displayDocTitle":"Feature extraction techniques for recognizing solid objects with an ultrasonic range sensor","publicationDate":"December 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature extraction techniques for recognizing solid objects with an ultrasonic range sensor","sourcePdf":"01087022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036582S","chronDate":"December  1985","isNumber":"23630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"77","articleId":"1087022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087026,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The achievement of the target dynamics (the target impedance is introduced in Part I) and preservation of stability robustness in the presence of bounded model uncertainties are the key issues in the design method. State-feedback and force-feedforward gains are chosen to guarantee the achievement of the target dynamics, while preserving stability in the presence of the model uncertainties. In general, the closed-loop behavior of a system cannot be shaped arbitrarily over an arbitrarily wide frequency range. It is proved that a special class of impedances that represent our set of performance specifications are mathematically achievable asymptotically through state-feedback and interaction-force feedforward as actuator bandwidths become large, and we offer a geometrical design method for achieving them in the presence of model uncertainties. The design method reveals a classical trade-off between a system's performance over a bounded frequency range and its stability relative to model uncertainties via multivariable Nyquits criteria. Two classes of such uncertainties are dealt with. While the first class of model uncertainties is formed from the uncertainties in the parameters of the modeled dynamics, the high-frequency unmodeled dynamics form the second class of model uncertainties.

Simple manipulator pick-and-place and tracking tasks allowed quantitative comparison of a number of calligraphic display viewing conditions. An enhanced perspective display was effective with a reference line from target to base, with or without a complex three-dimensional grid framing the view. This was true especially if geometrical display parameters such as azimuth (AZ) and elevation (EL) were arranged to be near optimal. Quantitative comparisons were made possible utilizing control performance measures such as root mean square error (rmse). There was a distinct preference for controlling the manipulator in end-effector Cartesian space for our primitive pick-and-place task, rather than controlling joint angles and then, via direct kinematics, the end-effector position. An introduced communication delay was found to produce decrease in performance. In considerable part, this difficulty could be compensated for by preview control information.

The control system worked in parallel with a robot controller by calculating position corrections that allowed forces to be controlled in the desired manner.

Stable force-control algorithms were designed in spite of limitations imposed by flexibility in the robot drive train. For multi-degree-of-freedom force control, it is shown that each axis can be considered autonomous, obviating the need for a multivariable approach. Force control was implemented in both edge following and deburring experiments. In edge following, the commanded normal force ranged from 1 to 15 N, while the root mean square (rms) force errors remained constant. Errors increased from 0.5 to 1.5 N rms as tangential speed was increased from 1 to 9 cm s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n.

The learning controller requires no a priori knowledge of the relationships between the sensor outputs and the command variables, facilitating control system modification for specific applications. The results of two learning experiments using a General Electric P-5 manipulator are presented. The first involved learning to use the video image feedback to position the robot hand accurately relative to stationary objects on a table, assuming no knowledge of the robot kinematics or camera characteristics. The second involved learning to use video image feedback to intercept and track objects moving on a conveyor. In both experiments, control system performance was found to be limited by the resolution of the sensor feedback data, rather than by control structure limitations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1987.1087081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23636/01087081.pdf","endPage":"165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor-based control of robotic manipulators using a general learning algorithm","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1987.1087081","startPage":"157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","displayDocTitle":"Sensor-based control of robotic manipulators using a general learning algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087081/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"April 1987","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor-based control of robotic manipulators using a general learning algorithm","sourcePdf":"01087081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037179S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"23636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"227","articleId":"1087081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1087086,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These operators can be efficiently implemented in near real time machine vision systems which have special hardware support for gray-scale morphologic operations. The simplest morphologic edge detectors are the dilation residue and erosion residue operators. The underlying motivation for these and some of their combinations are discussed and justified. Finally, the blur-minimum morphologic edge operator is defined. Its inherent noise sensitivity is less than the dilation or the erosion residue operators. Some experimental results are provided to show the validity of these morphologic operators. When compared with the enhancement/thresholding edge detectors and the cubic facet second derivative zero-crossing edge operator, the results show that all the edge operators have similar performance when the noise is small. However, as the noise increases, the second derivative zero-crossing edge operator and the blur-minimum morphologic edge operator have much better performance than the rest of the operators. The advantage of the blur-minimum edge operator is that it is less computationally complex than the facet edge operator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Morphologic edge detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Morphologic edge detection","sourcePdf":"01087088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031484S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"23636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"232","articleId":"1087088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1087089,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The system consists of vision modules performing image processing, three-dimensional shape recovery, and geometric reasoning, as well as modules for planning, navigating, and piloting. The system runs in two distinct modes, bootstrap and feedforward. The bootstrap mode requires analysis of entire images to find and model the objects of interest in the scene (e.g., roads). In the feedforward mode (while the vehicle is moving), attention is focused on small parts of the visual field as determined by prior views of the scene, to continue to track and model the objects of interest. General navigational tasks are decomposed into three categories, all of which contribute to planning a vehicle path. They are called long-, intermediate-, and short-range navigation, reflecting the scale to which they apply. The system has been implemented as a set of concurrent communicating modules and used to drive a camera (carried by a robot arm) over a scale model road network on a terrain board.

The method takes advantage of the fact that in this case overall motion takes place with one degree of freedom (DOF) only. Transforming the equations of motion to this one DOF results in a set of equations which defines the phase space of admissible motion constrained by path geometry and joint torques in a transparent way. The time optimal solution representing the maximum mobility of the path-manipulator configuration can be easily determined by a field of extremals bound by a maximum velocity curve, which acts as a trajectory source or sink.

The vehicle design has been partitioned into sensor, control, and planning subsystems. A distributed blackboard scheme has been developed which provides the mechanism by which these subsystems are coordinated. Vehicle position and orientation are supplied by vehicle attitude and navigation sensor subsystems. Obstacle avoidance capability has been implemented by fusing information from vision and acoustic ranging sensors into local goals and avoidance points. The influence of these points is combined through potential field techniques to accomplish obstacle avoidance control. Distant terrain characteristics are identified using information from a gray-level vision system, a color vision system, and a computer-controlled laser ranging sensor. These characteristics are used by a general planning engine to develop the desired path to a visible goal in the direction of the final goal. Progress to the final goal consists of a succession of movements from one distant but visible intermediate goal to another. The experience from implementing this autonomous vehicle has indicated the need for an integrated set of debugging tools which make the faults in subsystem hardware and software more distinguishable.","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1987.1087091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23637/01087091.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1987.1087091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ground surveillance robot (GSR): An autonomous vehicle designed to transit unknown terrain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","displayDocTitle":"The ground surveillance robot (GSR): An autonomous vehicle designed to transit unknown terrain","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ground surveillance robot (GSR): An autonomous vehicle designed to transit unknown terrain","sourcePdf":"01087091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031563S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"23637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"49","articleId":"1087091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1087094,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Under the accepted model, the robot, using information about its immediate surroundings provided by the sensory feedback, continuously (dynamically) generates its path. Various kinematic configurations of planar arms with revolute and sliding joints are analyzed in this paper from the standpoint of applying the same strategy.

The system uses sonar range data to build a multileveled description of the robot's surroundings. Sonar readings are interpreted using probability profiles to determine empty and occupied areas. Range measurements from multiple points of view are integrated into a sensor-level sonar map, using a robust method that combines the sensor information in such a way as to cope with uncertainties and errors in the data. The resulting two-dimensional maps are used for path planning and navigation. From these sonar maps, multiple representations are developed for various kinds of problem-solving activities. Several dimensions of representation are defined: the abstraction axis, the geographical axis, and the resolution axis.

Previous systems for stereo navigation have suffered from poor accuracy, in part because they relied on scalar models of measurement error in triangulation. Using three-dimensional (3D) Gaussian distributions to model triangulation error is shown to lead to much better performance. How to compute the error model from image correspondences, estimate robot motion between frames, and update the global positions of the robot and the landmarks over time are discussed. Simulations show that, compared to scalar error models, the 3D Gaussian reduces the variance in robot position estimates and better distinguishes rotational from translational motion. A short indoor run with real images supported these conclusions and computed the final robot position to within two percent of distance and one degree of orientation. These results illustrate the importance of error modeling in stereo vision for this and other applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","publicationDate":"June 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"3","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error modeling in stereo navigation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error modeling in stereo navigation","sourcePdf":"01087097.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040791S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"23637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"331","articleId":"1087097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087102,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results are based on a recently developed singular perturbation formulation of the manipulator equations of motion where the singular perturbation parameter \u00b5 is the inverse of the joint stiffness. For this class of systems it is known that the reduced-order model corresponding to the mechanical system under the assumption of perfect rigidity is globally linearizable via nonlinear static-state feedback, but that the full-order flexible system is not, in general, linearizable in this manner. The concept of integral manifold is utilized to represent the dynamics of the slow subsystem. The slow subsystem reduces to the rigid model as the perturbation parameter \u00b5 tends to zero. It is shown that linearizability of the rigid model implies linearizability of the flexible system restricted to the integral manifold. Based on a power series expansion of the integral manifold around \u00b5 = 0, it is shown how to approximate the feedback linearizing control to any order in \u00b5. The result is then an approximate feedback linearization which, assuming stability of the fast variables, linearizes the system for all practical purposes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23638/01087102.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1987.1087102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1987.1087102","startPage":"291","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integral manifold approach to the feedback control of flexible joint robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087102/","displayDocTitle":"An integral manifold approach to the feedback control of flexible joint robots","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integral manifold approach to the feedback control of flexible joint robots","sourcePdf":"01087102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05735S","chronDate":"August  1987","isNumber":"23638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"350","articleId":"1087102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087106,"authors":[{"name":"S.

When the generalized inverse is formulated in terms of accelerations and incorporated into the dynamics, the effect of redundancy resolution on joint torque can be directly reflected. One method chooses the joint acceleration null-space vector to minimize joint torque in a least squares sense; when the least squares is weighted by allowable torque range, the joint torques tend to be kept within their limits. Contrasting methods employing only the pseudoinverse with and without weighting by the inertia matrix are presented. The results show an unexpected stability problem during long trajectories for the null-space methods and for the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse method, but more seldom for the unweighted pseudoinverse method.

The controller distributes the fast motion to the small fast manipulator and the slow gross motion to the positioning part. A position reference is generated on-line to the positioning part to avoid singularities and the loss of degrees of freedom. The task-space position vector is augmented by the generalized coordinates of the positioning part. Feedback linearization and decoupling are then applied in the augmented task space to obtain a model consisting of decoupled double integrators. These decoupled double integrators are controlled by the use of linear quadratic optimal control. In the optimal control problem the performance index is chosen so that the task-space position reference is tracked with a high bandwidth while the reference to the positioning part is tracked with a low bandwidth. The controller has been applied to a simple planar redundant manipulator and an eight-link spray painting robot in simulation experiments. These simulations showed that a high bandwidth was possible with moderate actuator torques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23639/01087118.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1987.1087118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1987.1087118","startPage":"471","endPage":"475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task-space tracking with redundant manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087118/","displayDocTitle":"Task-space tracking with redundant manipulators","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"October 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task-space tracking with redundant manipulators","sourcePdf":"01087118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028411S","chronDate":"October  1987","isNumber":"23639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"112","articleId":"1087118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087120,"authors":[{"name":"T.

For this purpose, Raibert and Craig have proposed the hybrid position/force control method. In this method, however, the manipulator dynamics has not been taken into account rigorously. The dynamic hybrid control method is proposed, which takes the manipulator dynamics into consideration. Constraints on the end effector are described by a set of constraint hypersurfaces. Then the basic equations for dynamic hybrid control are derived. It is shown that if the manipulator is not in a singular configuration, the desired position and force at the end effector can be simultaneously realized.

The functional decomposition shows a limited amount of parallelism with a large amount of sequentialism in the flow of computation and data dependencies and reveals the requirement for computing a large set of elementary operations: multiplications, additions, divisions, square roots, trigonometric functions and their inverse. However, these elementary operations, in general, cannot be efficiently computed in general-purpose uniprocessor computers. The CORDIC algorithms are the natural candidates for efficiently computing these elementary operations and the interconnection of these CORDIC processors to exploit the great potential of pipelining provides a better solution for computing the inverse kinematic position solution. The functional decomposition of the inverse kinematic position solution into a set of computational tasks can be represented as a directed task graph. The inclusion of input data modifies the task graph to an acyclic data dependency graph (ADDG). The nodes of the ADDG correspond to the computational modules, each of which can be realized by a CORDIC processor. The operands or data move along the edges, each of which connects a pair of nodes. Due to different paths and computation time for each CORDIC processor, operands may arrive at multi-input modules at different arrival time, causing a longer pipelined time. Delay buffers may be inserted at various paths to achieve a balanced ADDG. The optimal buffer assignment problem is reduced to an integer linear optimization problem which can be solved easily by computers. The realization of the balanced ADDG results in a maximum pipelined CORDIC architecture with a minimum number of delay buffer stages for the computation of inverse kinematic position solution.","doi":"10.1109/JRA.1987.1087126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/56/23639/01087126.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRA.1987.1087126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A maximum pipelined CORDIC architecture for inverse kinematic position computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1987","displayDocTitle":"A maximum pipelined CORDIC architecture for inverse kinematic position computation","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 1987","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum pipelined CORDIC architecture for inverse kinematic position computation","sourcePdf":"01087126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035019S","chronDate":"October  1987","isNumber":"23639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"56","citationCount":"46","articleId":"1087126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1087127,"authors":[{"name":"Won Kim","affiliation":["Telerobotics Unit, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Won Kim","id":"37335428300"},{"name":"F.

The results indicate that stereoscopic display does generally permit superior pick-and-place performance, while monoscopic display can allow equivalent performance when it is defined with appropriate perspective parameter values and provided with adequate visual enhancements.

The case when the obstacles are \"known\" has been extensively studied in literature. Completely unexplored obstacle terrain is considered. In this case, the process of navigation involves both learning the information about the obstacle terrain and path planning. An algorithm is presented to navigate a robot in an unexplored terrain that is arbitrarily populated with disjoint convex polygonal obstacles in the plane. The navigation process is constituted by a number of traversals; each traversal is from an arbitrary source point to an arbitrary destination point. The proposed algorithm is proven to yield a convergent solution to each path of traversal. Initially, the terrain is explored using a rather primitive sensor, and the paths of traversal made may be suboptimal. The visibility graph that models the obstacle terrain is incrementally constructed by integrating the information about the paths traversed so far. At any stage of learning, the partially learned terrain model is represented as a learned visibility graph, and it is updated after each traversal. It is proven that the learned visibility graph converges to the visibility graph with probability one when the source and destination points are chosen randomly. Ultimately, the availability of the complete visibility graph enables the robot to plan globally optimal paths and also obviates the further usage of sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1987","publicationDate":"December 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"3","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robot navigation in unknown terrains using learned visibility graphs.

When the friction is compensated, the motor drive can approximately be described by a constant coefficient linear model. Standard methods can be applied to design a regulator for such a model. This results in a control law which is a combination of a fixed linear controller and an adaptive part which compensates for nonlinear friction effects. Experiments have clearly shown that both static and dynamic friction have nonsymmetric characteristics. They depend on the direction of motion.

Such sensing methods can employ transducers small enough to fit into a robot gripper, thereby providing terminal homing capability. Any such short range time-of-flight systems, however, have to solve the problem of rapid receiver recovery after the transmit pulse. In the present case the problem has been solved by an active damping scheme. The transducer is a capacitive element and is connected across an inductor to form an electrically resonant circuit at the acoustic frequency of interest. The LC tank is in the feedback path of a novel circuit that can be changed continuously from positive to negative feedback conditions. When the feedback is positive oscillations rapidly build up, when negative they just as rapidly die down. At the end of each positive - negative cycle essentially all of both the electrical and mechanical energy has been extracted from the system, which is then ready to receive the echo. In this way ranging is readily achieved down to \u223c1\", which is adequate for robot gripper applications.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1984.1087170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1984.1087170","startPage":"379","endPage":"384","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1984 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8150/23641/01087170.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1984 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping of ultrasonic transducers for robotic applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1984","displayDocTitle":"Active damping of ultrasonic transducers for robotic applications","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 1984","publicationDate":"1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087170/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping of ultrasonic transducers for robotic applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"01087170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05156S","chronDate":"Mar 1984","isNumber":"23641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8150","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1087170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1087176,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In this approach, collision avoidance, traditionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, allowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm using a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator control problem as direct control of manipulator motion in operational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Using visual sensing, real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087247","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8151/23642/01087247.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for manipulators and mobile robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","displayDocTitle":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for manipulators and mobile robots","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"2","publicationDate":"1985","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for manipulators and mobile robots","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017015S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"813","articleId":"1087247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087249,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We show that the addition of redundant joints can also increase the dynamic response for small motions of the manipulator at its endpoint. We begin by considering a two link mechanism, which is the simplest redundant system for effecting motion in a single direction. It is shown that the addition of a second link reduces the power required for sinusoidal motion at the mechanism endpoint. A method of choosing the relative link dimensions is then presented. Given a particular choice of link lengths, we show how to allocate motion between the joints to minimize the power required for a specified amplitude of motion. Finally, a strategy is proposed for local control of this redundant system which uses a quick acting mode to respond to disturbances and high bandwidth commands, and a slow acting mode to return the mechanism to a nominal configuration. The implications for control of redundant manipulator systems (i.e. hand and arm systems) are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087264/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1985","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and control of a redundant mechanism for small motion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and control of a redundant mechanism for small motion","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060537S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1087264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087266,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The control system works in parallel with a robot controller by calculating position corrections that allow force to be controlled in the desired manner. The corrections were successfully interfaced to the position control loop on an individual axis level. Stable force control algorithms were designed in spite of limitations imposed by flexibility in the robot drive train. In the multi-degree of freedom control case it is shown that each axis can be considered autonomous, obviating the need for a multivariable approach. Control was implemented in edge following experiments. Across levels of commanded normal force ranging from 0 to 15 N, the RMS force errors remain constant. Errors increased from 0.5 N to 1.5 N RMS as tangential speed was increased from 0 to 9 cm/sec. The performance of the force control system during deburring operations is characterized across the full force and speed range of the cutting tools used. Smoothness of cut is shown to be consistent with standard deburring operations in terms of optimal feed and metal removal rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087272/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","publicationDate":"1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Control of tool/Workpiece contact force with application to robotic deburring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of tool/Workpiece contact force with application to robotic deburring","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042397S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1087272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1087274,"authors":[{"name":"B.

An insertion of an additional joint into the robot may solve the problems. This paper discusses only the singularity problem at which the robot degenerates.

The role of vision as the feedback transducer affects closed-loop dynamics, and a visual feedback control strategy is required. Vision-based robot control research has focused on vision processing issues, while control system design has been limited to ad-hoc strategies. We formalize an analytical approach to dynamic robot visual servo control systems by first casting position-based and image-based strategies into classical feedback control structures. The image-based structure represents a new approach to visual servo control, which uses image features (e.g., image areas, and centroids) as feedback control signals, thus eliminating a complex interpretation step (i.e., interpretation of image features to derive world-space coordinates). Image-based control presents formidable engineering problems for controller design, including coupled and nonlinear dynamics, kinematics, and feedback gains, unknown parameters, and measurement noise and delays. A model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) is designed to satisfy these requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087296","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8151/23642/01087296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23642","startPage":"662","endPage":"668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic visual servo control of robots: An adaptive image-based approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic visual servo control of robots: An adaptive image-based approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087296/","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic visual servo control of robots: An adaptive image-based approach","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035788S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1087296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087302,"authors":[{"name":"J.-J.

A sonar range reading provides information concerning empty and occupied volumes in a cone (subtending 30 degrees in our case) in front of the sensor. The reading is modelled as probability profiles projected onto a rasterized map, where somewhere occupied and everywhere empty areas are represented. Range measurements from multiple points of view (taken from multiple sensors on the robot, and from the same sensors after robot moves) are systematically integrated in the map. Overlapping empty volumes re-inforce each other, and serve to condense the range of occupied volumes. The map definition improves as more readings are added. The final map shows regions probably occupied, probably unoccupied, and unknown areas. The method deals effectively with clutter, and can be used for motion planning and for extended landmark recognition. This system has been tested on the Neptune mobile robot at CMU.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087316","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8151/23642/01087316.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23642","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High resolution maps from wide angle sonar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High resolution maps from wide angle sonar","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087316/","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution maps from wide angle sonar","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02972S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"767","articleId":"1087316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1087319,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Depth information about the selected points of the scene is obtained by stereo vision. The determination of disparity is solved by changing the point of view of the TV camera employed by means of two oscillating mirrors which allow continuous tracking of the selected points. A specialized image processor has been designed to deal with the tasks of selection of outstanding points of objects (vertices) and continuous tracking of these points between consecutive images when displacing the mirrors in order to obtain a short time of calculation as well as a low cost system. That way at the end of each sweep of the mirrors we get the information needed to solve triangulation from pairs of homologe points. The time spent to get the three dimensional information of the scene is about one second, which corresponds to the time need to get enough intermediate images to guarantee the correct tracking of vertices.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087364","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8151/23642/01087364.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision system with 3D capabilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087364/","displayDocTitle":"A vision system with 3D capabilities","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1985","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision system with 3D capabilities","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054412S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1087364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1087373,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Multiple sensory information is fed to the finger control unit: most significant is that obtained through a composite, skinlike tactile sensor, developed in our laboratory and based on the technology of ferroelectric polymers. In this paper we discuss the design and describe some components of our sensorized scenario. The main features of the articulated exploratory finger are presented and a hybrid type of control, purposely devised for object exploration with tactile feedback, is outlined. Emphasis is also given to the discussion of design criteria for skin-like tactile sensors and to the description of the fingertip multifunctional ferroelectric polymer tactile sensor. Finally, some preliminary experimental results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087375","startPage":"701","endPage":"706","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8151/23642/01087375.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tendon actuated exploratory finger with polymeric, skin-like tactile sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tendons","Fingers","Polymers","Tactile sensors","Robot sensing systems","Humans","Laboratories","Skin","Ferroelectric materials","Hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","displayDocTitle":"Tendon actuated exploratory finger with polymeric, skin-like tactile sensor","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tendon actuated exploratory finger with polymeric, skin-like tactile sensor","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022489S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1087375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":1087376,"authors":[{"name":"Yubin Hung","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory Center for Automation Research, University of Maryland, MD"],"lastName":"Yubin Hung","id":"37979531300"},{"name":"Pen-Shu Yeh","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory Center for Automation Research, University of Maryland, MD"],"lastName":"Pen-Shu Yeh","id":"37980346800"},{"name":"D.

This navigation system is based on a dynamically maintained model of the local environment, called the \"Composite Local Model.\" The Composite Local Model integrates information from a rotating sonar sensor, the robot's touch sensor and a pre-learned Global Model as the robot moves through its environment. Techniques are described for constructing a line segment description of the most recent sensor scan (the Sensor Model), and for integrating such descriptions to build up a model of the immediate environment (the Composite Local Model). Model integration is based on a process of reinforcing the confidence in consistent information while decaying the confidence in inconsistent information. The estimated position of the robot is corrected by the difference in position between observed sensor signals and the corresponding symbols in the Composite Local Model. This system is useful for navigation in a finite, pre-learned domain such as a house, office, or factory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23642","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1985 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8151/23642/01087380.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1985.1087380","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic world modeling for an intelligent mobile robot using a rotating ultra-sonic ranging device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087380/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic world modeling for an intelligent mobile robot using a rotating ultra-sonic ranging device","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 1985","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"1985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic world modeling for an intelligent mobile robot using a rotating ultra-sonic ranging device","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01087380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035257S","chronDate":"Mar 1985","isNumber":"23642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8151","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1087380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1087385,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The end-effector dynamic model is used in the development of a control system in which the generalized operational space end-effector forces are selected as the command vector. This formulation provides a framework for natural and efficient integration of both end-effector force and motion control. A \"generalized position and force specification matrix\" is used for the specification of tasks that involve simultaneous motion and force operations. Flexibility in the force sensor, end-effector, and environment, and problems related to impact are discussed. The real-time operational space control system, COSMOS, has been recently implemented in the NYMPH multiprocessor system.

The motivation for this work is to pave the way for robots that can independently determine how to grasp and manipulate parts in a limited environment and to facilitate the design of advanced, but cost-effective manufacturing hands. We begin with an examination of grasps used by humans working with tools and metal parts. The grips are compared in terms of power, contact area, friction, damping and tactile sensitivity. The comparison leads to a grip taxonomy in which grasps are mapped against task-related quantities (such as power) and object-related quantities (such as slenderness). The examinations of the task requirements and grasps suggest a number of general principles for the design and control of manufacturing hands.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1986.1087525","startPage":"1533","endPage":"1539","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1986 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1986.1087525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23643","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1986 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8152/23643/01087525.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling manufacturing grips and correlations with the design of robotic hands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087525/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling manufacturing grips and correlations with the design of robotic hands","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling manufacturing grips and correlations with the design of robotic hands","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01087525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091553S","chronDate":"Apr 1986","isNumber":"23643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8152","citationCount":"68","articleId":"1087525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1087560,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A key result of this work is to have established sensitivity criteria for color detection in microelectronic structures. The resolution achieved allows us to measure differences in oxide thickness to approximately 30 Angstroms or better. By using the Ohta coordinates, our system can discrimimate between cyclically repeating hues. This determination can be done very rapidly (approximately 100 milliseconds) and does not require a complex (and thus expensive) computer system.

The object which may or may not be in contact with a rigid environment, is assumed to be held rigidly by n robot end-effectors. Natural and artificial position and force constraints are defined for a point on the object and two selection matrices are obtained to control the arms. The position control loops are designed based on each manipulator's Cartesian space dynamic equations. In the position control subspace, a feature is provided which allows the robot arms to exert additional forces/torques to achieve compression, tension, or torsion in the object without affecting the execution of the motion trajectories.

Manufacturing errors in machining and assembly of manipulators lead to discrepancies between the design parameters and the physical structure. Improving the kinematic performance thus requires identification of the actual kinematic parameters of each individual robot. This identification of the individual kinematic parameters is called the arm signature which is then incorporated into the manipulator's controller to improve positional accuracy. In this paper, an approach, based on a new parametric model of the kinematics, is introduced for arm signature identification. The S-Model utilizes 6.n parameters to describe the robot geometry and offers advantages for identification by decomposing the parameters into individually identified subsets. The S-Model parameters are then mapped into the equivalent Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for implementation into the controller. The S-Model arm signature identification algorithm can be implemented with relatively simple sensors and improves accuracy through statistical averaging. This algorithm has been implemented with an external ultrasonic range sensor to measure robot end-effector positions. Experimental results of arm signature identification of seven Unimation/Westinghouse Puma 560 robots demonstrated an average reduction in positioning error by a factor of 5-10 for a spectrum of representative test tasks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arm signature identification","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1986 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1986.1087664","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1986 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8152/23643/01087664.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1986.1087664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1986","displayDocTitle":"Arm signature identification","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arm signature identification","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01087664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030794S","chronDate":"Apr 1986","isNumber":"23643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8152","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1087664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":1087683,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Our goal is to develop a method for the design of controllers or constrained manipulators in the presence of model, uncertainties. The controller must carry out fine maneuvers when the manipulator is not constrained, and compliant motion, with or without Interaction-force measurement, when the manipulator is constrained. At the same time stability must be preserved If bounded uncertainties are allowed in modelling the manipulators. Stability of the manipulator and environment as a whole and the preservation of stability in the face of changes are two fundamental, issues that have been considered in the design method. We start with conventional controller design specifications concerning the treatment of external forces when the manipulator is not constrained. Generalizing this concept to include cases when the manipulator is constrained, we state a set of practical, design specifications in the frequency domain that is meaningful, from the standpoint of control, theory and assures the desired compliant motion. In the cartesian coordinate frame and stability in the presence of bounded uncertainties. This approach also assures the global stability of the manipulator and its environment. While this paper concerns the fundamentals of compliant motion, part 2 of this paper [Reference 24] is devoted to the controller design method.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1986.1087683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1986.1087683","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1986 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1986 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8152/23643/01087683.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fundamental concepts of robust compliant motion for robot manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1986","displayDocTitle":"The fundamental concepts of robust compliant motion for robot manipulators","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 1986","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"1986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fundamental concepts of robust compliant motion for robot manipulators","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01087683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046867S","chronDate":"Apr 1986","isNumber":"23643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8152","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1087683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087690,"authors":[{"name":"W.

For each operation the required resources and associated discrete resource states are identified. Also associated with each resource is a set of resource attributes which are modified by the processes underlying each operation. The structure of the discrete-level control is modeled by modified Petri nets which are synthesized from single resource activity cycles. Construction of the net provides discrete control logic for error recovery loops and other real-time decision structures with guaranteed properties based on extensions of previous results in Petri net theory.

The geometry of the architecture is composed of distributed, interleaved combinations of actuator inputs. It is fault tolerant and uses analog processing. Learning is achieved by modifying the distributions of input weights in the architecture after each arm positioning. Modifications of the weights are made incrementally according to errors of consistency between the actuator signals used to orient the cameras and those used to move the arm. Computer simulations show that errors in the intended arm acutator signals after learning are an average 4.3% of the signal range, across all possible targets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087798/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1987","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive visual-motor coordination in multijoint robots using parallel architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive visual-motor coordination in multijoint robots using parallel architecture","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032196S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1087798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1087820,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The results of the analyses are used by the world-modeling processes to correct their models of the environment. This interaction requires the development of real-time algorithms for the analysis of sensory data that can usefully employ guidance from models.

These accuracy and coupling issues are addressed by a methodology developed for the automatic global calibration of a robot/vision system. The methodology employs a stereo-pair of CCD array cameras, which are mounted to the end-effector of a six-axis revolute robot arm. With an automatic procedure,three-dimensional coordinate measurements are made, relative to the robot's base frame, of a single spherical point in space at numerous and widely varying joint-angle configurations. Based upon a modified Denavit-Hartenburg robot kinematic model, both geometric and nongeometric robotic errors are inferred simultaneously with the geometric errors of the vision system using an iterative least-squares algorithm. Preliminary results indicate an approximately threefold improvement in positioning accuracy of the robot arm.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01087836.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global calibration of a robot/vision system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Robot vision systems","Machine vision","Robot kinematics","Robotics and automation","Robot sensing systems","Orbital robotics","Service robots","Computer industry","Electrical equipment industry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","displayDocTitle":"Global calibration of a robot/vision system","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global calibration of a robot/vision system","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030618S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1087836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1087847,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Various algorithms are used for sinusoidal computations to trade off speed against memory usage. The algorithms have been both simulated and run on the actual hardware. The results indicate that the direct kinematics solution is obtained in under 10 microseconds with a 16-bit resolution.

This method for the manipulator system is an extension of the previously proposed method for gripper systems by the authors. Since present industrial robotic manipulators commonly employ the input/ output position servo control system, it is of great interest to control both force and position of the manipulator with this control system. However, it is not easy to control the manipulator without the knowledge of object dynamics. Then, it is necessary to adjust control gains, depending on handling objects. For this purpose, a method of the adaptive force control is presented here with consideration of object dynamics. Some simulations are carried out for a manipulator system to adjust pushing forces to various objects, and show the wider applicability and the flexible manipulation of manipulators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087917/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive force control of manipulators with consideration of object dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive force control of manipulators with consideration of object dynamics","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032833S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1087917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1087918,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Robot's mobility, i.e., its ability to move, is better in the directions requiring lower joint velocities. When the robot is near a singularity configuration, the joint velocities required to attain the end-effector velocity in certain directions are extremely high. Thus arbitrary directional changes become more difficult. Robot's flexibility, defined as its ability to change the direction of the end-effector motion, is low in the vicinity of singular configurations. Addition of redundant joints can greatly enhance their flexibility. However, this requires a proper utilization of redundancy. A control scheme is presented to improve the flexibility of redundant robots. The feasibility and effectiveness of this control scheme are demonstrated through simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087918","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01087918.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087918","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundant robot control for higher flexibility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","displayDocTitle":"Redundant robot control for higher flexibility","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087918/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundant robot control for higher flexibility","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035825S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1087918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1087932,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The coordinative manipulation problem is divided into two phases. One is determining the resultant force by multiple robotic mechanisms, and the other is determining the internal force between them. The resultant force is used for the manipulation of an object subjected by the external forces or the environmental constraints. The internal force is used for adapting the robotic mechanisms to uncertainty and variety of the static friction. A dynamic coordinative control scheme is proposed for determining the resultant forces. The optimal internal force is defined as the internal force that yields the minimal norm force satisfying static frictional constraints. The optimal internal force promotes the stability of prehension, while the conventional method sometimes result in too much internal force and reduce the stability. Finally, by applying a non-linear programming method, it is clarified that the optimal solution is necessarily obtained by solving, at most, 2(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n-1) (m is the number of robotic mechanisms) sets of algebraic equations if it exists.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","publicationDate":"1987","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Mechanics of coordinative manipulation by multiple robotic mechanisms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanics of coordinative manipulation by multiple robotic mechanisms","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035246S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"155","articleId":"1087941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1087946,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Inverse kinematics and dynamics for 6 degrees of freedom arms are often used as benchmarks to measure controller speed. According to current estimates, the new processor we describe can compute both of these problems, using 32 bit fixed-point operations, in less than 250 microseconds. This is an order of magnitude faster than existing state-of-the-art systems. Such benchmarks only measure a smallportion of the true robot control problem. The issues of interpolation, input/output, and multiple axis synchronization must also be addressed. As robotics becomes more advanced, the need for more compatationally intensive control algorithms (hybrid position/force control, sensory-based control, multiple robot cooperation, etc.) will grow. These now computationally-intractable problems must ultimately be computed in real-time. In this paper, we discuss current progress on a flexible (i.e. programmable) system which is fast enough to approach such problems. The system is targetted to support up to 40 synchronized axes, performing advanced control algorithms with an update rate over 1 KHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Control systems","Real time systems","Computer architecture","Equations","Communication system control","Robot sensing systems","Coprocessors","Microelectronics","Kinematics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087952","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087952","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01087952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087952","startPage":"664","endPage":"670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new architecture for robot control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new architecture for robot control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new architecture for robot control","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033734S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1087952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1087955,"authors":[{"name":"Ki Suh","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Lincroft, NJ"],"lastName":"Ki Suh","id":"37087351943"},{"name":"J.

Configuration maps provide a basis for planning the operation sequences which occur in parts-feeder designs or in more general sensorless manipulation strategies for robots. Sequences of elementary operations are represented as matrix-products of configuration maps for the individual operations. Efficient methods for searching the space of all operations sequences are described. As an example we consider a class of parts feeders based on a conveyor belt. Parts arrive on the belt in random initial orientations. By interacting with a series of stationary fences angled across the belt, the parts are aligned into a unique final orientation independent of their initial orientation. The planning problem is to create (given the shape of a part) a sequence of fences which will align that part. We demonstrate the automated design of such parts feeders.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087972","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01087972.pdf","startPage":"696","endPage":"701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning robotic manipulation strategies for sliding objects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087972/","displayDocTitle":"Planning robotic manipulation strategies for sliding objects","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1987","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning robotic manipulation strategies for sliding objects","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035713S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"22","articleId":"1087972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1087982,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The main distinction is that we separate the description of the task from constraints of anti-collision. This enables to control accurately all relevant measures of the problem. A task is expressed by the minimization of a function plus eventually some geometric constraints, whereas anti-collision is translated into very simple linear constraints through the methods of the velocity dampers and the tangent separating planes. This approach is applied to the control of manipulators with a high number of degrees of freedom, using hierarchical descriptions of the environment and the robots. This is illustrated by two realizations, path planning for a ten link manipulator in the cluttered environment of a nuclear plant reactor, and cooperative tasks between two six degree of freedom robots. In the end we discuss how to incorporate the action of a global planner in this general framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01087982.pdf","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1159","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A local based approach for path planning of manipulators with a high number of degrees of freedom","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Manipulators","Robots","Motion planning","Orbital robotics","Minimization methods","Joining processes","Law","Legal factors","Wrist"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","displayDocTitle":"A local based approach for path planning of manipulators with a high number of degrees of freedom","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A local based approach for path planning of manipulators with a high number of degrees of freedom","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031568S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"129","articleId":"1087982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":1087984,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Since microelectronics fabrication is in large part a thin film technology, and since thin films have characteristic colors, this approach extends the range of optical analysis possible. We have constructed a color vision system used to measure thin film dielectric materials. Color matching is performed rapidly (<100 msecs) and with resolution better than 20 \u00c5. The resolution limit has been so far set only by the samples available for measurement. We have further extended the capability of the system beyond simple color matching to identify true unknown samples whose thickness fall within the range of the original system database. Feed-back control of the illumination has been incorporated into the system; we present data on the effect of shifts in lighting or magnification. Microscopic, as well as broad area measurements (for uniformity) can be made.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087984","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01087984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","startPage":"515","endPage":"519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A color vision system for film thickness determination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A color vision system for film thickness determination","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1087984/","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A color vision system for film thickness determination","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01087984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032722S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1087984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1087993,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The parameters to be calibrated are the horizontal scale factor, i.e. the factor that relates the sensor element spacing of a discrete array camera to the picture element spacing after sampling by the image acquisition circuitry, and the image center, i.e. the intersection of the optical axis with the camera sensor. The scale factor calibration uses a 1D-FFT and is accurate and efficient. It also permits the use of only one coplanar set of calibration points for general camera calibration. Three groups of techniques for center calibration are presented: Group I requires using a laser and a four-degree of freedom adjustment of its orientation, but is simplest in concept, and is accurate and reproducible. Group II is simple to perform, but is less accurate than the other two. The most general Group III is accurate and efficient, but requires accurate image feature extraction of calibration points with known 3D coordinates. A feasible setup is described. Results of real experiments are presented and compared with theoretical predictions. Accuracy and reproducibility of the calibrated parameters are reported, as well as the improvement in actual 3D measurement due to center calibration.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1088012","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01088012.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1088012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques for calibration of the scale factor and image center for high accuracy 3D machine vision metrology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088012/","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for calibration of the scale factor and image center for high accuracy 3D machine vision metrology","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1987","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for calibration of the scale factor and image center for high accuracy 3D machine vision metrology","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01088012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05885S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"56","articleId":"1088012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1088017,"authors":[{"name":"P.

While the former utilizes the complete dynamics model of the manipulator, the latter assumes a decoupled and linear model of the manipulator dynamics. We discuss the design of controller gains for both the computed-torque and the independent joint control schemes and establish a framework for comparing their trajectory tracking performance. Our experiments show that within each scheme the trajectory tracking accuracy varies slightly with the change of the sampling rate. However, at low sampling rates the computed-torque scheme outperforms the independent joint control scheme. Based on our experimental results, we also conclusively establish the importance of high sampling rates as they result in an increased stiffness of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1088017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1088017","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8153/23644/01088017.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1987 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Choosing sampling rates for robot control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1987","displayDocTitle":"Choosing sampling rates for robot control","conferenceDate":"31 March-3 April 1987","publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088017/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choosing sampling rates for robot control","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01088017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026315S","chronDate":"Mar 1987","isNumber":"23644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8153","citationCount":"31","articleId":"1088017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1088028,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The control problem is solved as a design problem for a linear system by first applying a nonlinear feedback and nonlinear coordinate transformation to linearize the nonlinear dynamic equation, and then employing the linear optimal control theory to design a robust controller in the task space.

In recognition test using plastic workpieces, the recognition time was about 9 seconds for five pieces.

This theory is applied to design a 1.6-Gigasample/s 6-b flash ADC in baseline 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. A distributed track and hold is implemented to achieve a high sample rate. The small input signal is amplified through a cascade of amplifiers and gradually transformed into robust digital signal levels. An averaging termination circuit has been designed to resemble the infinite string of resistors and amplifiers. By applying termination to the averaging network, the amount of overrange amplifiers and, therefore, the power consumption is reduced, while the linearity and speed performance are maintained. The optimum number of parallel pre-amplifiers is derived on the basis of the tradeoff between the amplifier offset and distortion.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2002.804334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/23646/01088086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2002.804334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23646","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 6-b 1.6-Gsample/s flash ADC in 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS using averaging termination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 6-b 1.6-Gsample/s flash ADC in 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS using averaging termination","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","accessionNumber":"7477038","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088086/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 6-b 1.6-Gsample/s flash ADC in 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS using averaging termination","sourcePdf":"01088086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052602S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"23646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"23646","articleId":"1088086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088087,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A low-IF image-reject conversion architecture is used for the receiver. The transmitter uses direct IQ-upconversion. The VCO runs at 4.8-5.0 GHz, thus facilitating the generation of 0/spl deg/ and 90/spl deg/ signals for both the receiver and transmitter. By using an inductor-less LNA and the extensive use of mismatch simulations, the smallest silicon area for a Bluetooth radio implementation so far can be reached: 5.5 mm/sup 2/. The transceiver consumes 30 mA in receive mode and 35 mA in transmit mode from a 2.5 to 3.0-V power supply. As the radio operates on the same die as baseband and SW, the crosstalk-on-silicon is an important issue. This crosstalk problem was taken into consideration from the start of the project.

The design, based on a 2.23-GHz microstrip resonator and a single flux quantum comparator, exploits several advantages of superconducting electronics: the high quality factor of resonators, the fast switching speed of the Josephson junction, natural quantization of voltage pulses, and high circuit sensitivity. The modulator test chip includes an integrated acquisition memory for capturing output data at sampling rates up to 45 GHz. The small size (256 b) of the acquisition memory limits the frequency resolution of spectra based on standard fast Fourier transforms. Output spectra with enhanced resolution are obtained with a segmented correlation method.

The single BiCMOS chip includes a quad-band direct conversion receiver that down converts RF to quadrature analog baseband. The front-end circuitry is followed by a low-DC-offset, high-dynamic-range, analog I/Q baseband chain.

However, polar transmitters are difficult to implement because of the wide bandwidths associated with the phase and envelope signals. Moreover, accurate synchronization between envelope and phase components is essential in minimizing distortion. A concept named Interleaving Delta Modulation (iDM) is proposed to overcome some of the issues associated with polar transmission. IDM minimizes distortion and improves efficiency by replacing a stream of fast drive pulses to the amplitude modulator with a parallel stream of slower pulses. Circuitry to implement iDM has been designed, fabricated, and measured in 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2002.804351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2002.804351","startPage":"1748","endPage":"1756","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/23646/01088104.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wide-band linear amplitude modulator for polar transmitters based on the concept of interleaving delta modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 2002","displayDocTitle":"A wide-band linear amplitude modulator for polar transmitters based on the concept of interleaving delta modulation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1088104/","accessionNumber":"7477055","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088104/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wide-band linear amplitude modulator for polar transmitters based on the concept of interleaving delta modulation","sourcePdf":"01088104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048292S","chronDate":"Dec 2002","xplore-pub-id":"sgml","isNumber":"23646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"11","articleId":"1088104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1088106,"authors":[{"name":"J.

An on-chip LC-type voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is employed by both the transmitter and receiver. The chipset operates at multiple data rates (9.95-10.71 Gb/s) with functionality compatible with the multisource agreement (MSA) for 10-Gb transponders. Both chips demonstrate SONET-compliant jitter characteristics. The transmitter 10.66-GHz output clock jitter is 0.065 UI/sub pp/ (unit interval, peak-to-peak) over a 50-kHz-80-MHz bandwidth. The receiver jitter tolerance is more than 0.4 UI/sub pp/ at high frequencies (4-80 MHz). A high level of integration and low-power consumption is achieved by using a standard CMOS process.

Therefore the channel capacity is also a random variable and can vary from zero to infinity in a Rayleigh channel. Given this random nature of the channel capacity when the transmitter does not have channel knowledge, any signaling rate it chooses to use may not be supported by the channel with a finite probability, leading to a transmission error even when ideal channel coding for that chosen rate is employed. Therefore, in the absence of channel knowledge, the packet (or block) error rate (PER) is equal to the outage of capacity for the specified signaling rate. We study the fundamental limits on packet error rate versus signaling rate versus average SNR and the performance tradeoffs therein. We then examine such tradeoffs for several specific space-time coding schemes have. been. proposed that maximize either rate or diversity.

The major drivers for these systems are the increasing demand for personal mobile communications with respect to performance, applications, traffic, and ease of use including communications involving machines. Cost reduction in terms of more bits for the same money is a major requirement to enable the economic success of future systems. From the user perspective increasing personal mobility enforces mobile communications in business and the private sector. ITU-R WP8F, ITU-T SSG and bodies like WWRF are currently working on the vision of systems beyond IMT-2000 on a global basis, and are defining basic requirements. New elements of these systems for the mobile access (up to 100 Mbps peak cell capacity) and the nomadic/wireless local area access (up to 1 Gbps peak cell capacity) are being discussed. These requirements result in a significant reduction of the covered range and, thereby, in the cell size compared to the third generation. In addition, a huge amount of spectrum is required to enable these requirements. The impact on attainable range and spectrum demand for a new mobile broadband access element is investigated. The nomadic/wireless local area access is not considered.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088128","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088128.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"46 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data rate estimates, range calculations and spectrum demand for new elements of systems beyond IMT-2000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Data rate estimates, range calculations and spectrum demand for new elements of systems beyond IMT-2000","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643910","htmlLink":"/document/1088128/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data rate estimates, range calculations and spectrum demand for new elements of systems beyond IMT-2000","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053975S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088134,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However the interference resulting from the transmissions from multiple base sites in the forward link during the soft handoff constrains the multiple access capacity. Site selection diversity transmission (SSDT) technique is able to mitigate the interference caused by transmissions from the multiple base sites. The 3/sup rd/ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has specified this technique for the W-CDMA FDD component of UMTS. This paper describes the SSDT technique and presents capacity simulation results.

In this work, a semi-analytical model is developed, considering the case of sectorized cells and taking soft and softer handover into account, which allows the investigation of the impact on downlink capacity of an unequal contribution of power coming from the base transceiver stations (BTSs) connected to the mobiles in soft (or softer) handover. A multi-service environment is investigated, in particular the case of mixed traffic scenarios. The results show the downlink capacity as a function of some interesting parameters, such as the cell radius, the number of bases in the users active sets, and the fraction of mobiles generating data traffic. It is shown that the system capacity can be maximized by selecting a proper unbalance between the contributions to the energy per bit over noise plus interference ratio, given by the different bases in the active set.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088135.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"81 vol.1","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink capacity for WCDMA with soft and softer handover; advantages of unbalanced received powers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Flexible printed circuits","Rayleigh channels","Shadow mapping","Switching circuits","Power system modeling","Active noise reduction","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","broadband networks","cellular radio","radio links","channel capacity","transceivers","multiuser channels","data communication","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink capacity","soft handover","softer handover","unbalanced received power","WCDMA radio systems","base transceiver stations","coverage","cell capacity","semi-analytical model","sectorized cells","multi-service environment","mixed traffic","cell radius","data traffic","system capacity","energy per bit over noise","interference ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Downlink capacity for WCDMA with soft and softer handover; advantages of unbalanced received powers","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1088135/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643917","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink capacity for WCDMA with soft and softer handover; advantages of unbalanced received powers","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048929S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088136,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hoon Cho","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ji-Hoon Cho","id":"37982870900"},{"name":"Do-Young Kwak","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Do-Young Kwak","id":"37976876200"},{"name":"Seoung-Cheol Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seoung-Cheol Kim","id":"37069763200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7442-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"1088136","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Ray tracing","Predictive models","Power system modeling","Quality of service","Scattering","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Communication industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","broadband networks","radio links","channel capacity","ray tracing","multiuser channels","radiowave propagation","cellular radio","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WCDMA downlink capacity","deterministic ray-tracing channel model","service environment","Yeouido","Seoul","Korea","high rise building","site-specific sector averaged path losses","receiver locations","cellular radio","system capacity","macro diversity","orthogonal factor"]}],"abstract":"An analysis of WCDMA downlink capacity is presented for a real service environment at Yeouido, Seoul, Korea which is considered as a typical high rise building environment.

The resource sharing factor of each traffic class can be calculated by dividing the total resource allocated for that class by the maximum available resource, R/sub max/. The summation of the resource sharing factors of all traffic classes is smaller than one.

Besides, since each user has his or her own speaking condition, we are able to express the effects of statistical multiplexing effect and interference equalization.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088138.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"96 vol.1","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity evaluation with time base analysis in W-CDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Capacity planning","Base stations","Speech analysis","Mobile communication","Markov processes","Computer simulation","Interference","Probability","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","broadband networks","multiuser channels","channel capacity","Markov processes","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","radio networks","multiplexing","land mobile radio","voice communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity evaluation","time base analysis","W-CDMA system","voice process","two-state Markov process","statistical multiplexing","voice activation","statistical average data","time duration","computer simulation","speaking condition","interference equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Capacity evaluation with time base analysis in W-CDMA system","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1088138/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643920","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity evaluation with time base analysis in W-CDMA system","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052544S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088139,"authors":[{"name":"K.

By using a relay, a considerable transmit power reduction might be achieved. Particularly, those terminals located in the shadowing region or in the cell edge are able to reduce the transmit power by asking a nearby terminal with low propagation loss to the base station to relay its signal. For relaying, the same frequency bands that are already allocated are assumed to be reused. This might cause an excessive interference due to the uncoordinated frequency reuse. To clarify these points, a two-hop DS-CDMA cellular system and a conventional DS-CDMA cellular system without relaying are compared in terms of the user capacity and transmit power. Simulation results reveal that the system capacity can be increased by using a sophisticated routing scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088139","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088139.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"101 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and transmission power estimation of two-hop CDMA cellular system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088139/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and transmission power estimation of two-hop CDMA cellular system","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643921","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1088139/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and transmission power estimation of two-hop CDMA cellular system","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070215S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088141,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

In time- and frequency-selective MIMO channels this interaction happens in time, frequency and space. We propose a four-dimensional Karhunen-Loeve-like Fourier series representation for space-time channels that captures the essence of such interaction and exposes the intrinsic degrees of freedom in the channel. The four dimensions are: time, frequency and the two spatial dimensions at the transmitter and receiver. The key signal space parameters are the signaling duration, bandwidth and the two array apertures. The corresponding channel parameters are the delay, Doppler and the two angular spreads associated with the scattering environment. The representation induces a virtual partitioning of propagation paths in time, frequency and space that reveals their contribution to channel capacity and diversity. It also exposes fundamental dependencies between time, frequency and space thereby revealing the essential independent degrees of freedom in the channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088141.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"111 vol.1","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Essential degrees of freedom in time and frequency selective MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Delay","Channel capacity","Fourier series","Bandwidth","Scattering parameters","Frequency diversity","Doppler shift","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","Fourier series","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Doppler effect","radiowave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","array signal processing","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective MIMO channels","time selective MIMO channels","signal space","4D Karhunen-Loeve-like Fourier series","space-time channels","degrees of freedom","spatial dimensions","transmitter","receiver","signal space parameters","signaling duration","bandwidth","array apertures","channel parameters","delay","Doppler","angular spreads","scattering environment","virtual partitioning","propagation paths","channel capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Essential degrees of freedom in time and frequency selective MIMO channels","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1088141/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643923","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Essential degrees of freedom in time and frequency selective MIMO channels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040203S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1088142,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

(2002) to converge into the optimum power allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088146.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"134 vol.1","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum capacity optimization of the MIMO Gaussian MAC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Covariance matrix","Downlink","Broadcasting","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Iterative algorithms","Interference constraints","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","MIMO systems","multi-access systems","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum capacity optimization","MIMO Gaussian MAC","Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output multiple-access channel","sum power constraint","maximization","sum capacity","vector multiple access channel","broadcast channel","Sato bound","iterative water-filling algorithm","optimum power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Sum capacity optimization of the MIMO Gaussian MAC","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1088146/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643928","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum capacity optimization of the MIMO Gaussian MAC","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105482S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088147,"authors":[{"name":"Kunseok Kang","affiliation":[" Radio & Broadcasting Research Laboratory, ETRI, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kunseok Kang","id":"37279669000"},{"name":"Kweonhue Choi","affiliation":[" Radio & Broadcasting Research Laboratory, ETRI, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kweonhue Choi","id":"37983328800"},{"name":"Sooyoung Kim Shin","affiliation":[" Radio & Broadcasting Research Laboratory, ETRI, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sooyoung Kim Shin","id":"37335431800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7442-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"1088147","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a reduced search algorithm to find optimum Walsh-Hadamard (WH) code sets which can maintain almost the minimum peak to average power ratio (PAPR) in multi-carrier (MC) CDMA system. It was discovered that the PAPR of MC-CDMA system can be reduced by suitably allocating the user codes. The code allocation table must be made before the system operation, in order to dynamically allocate the optimum WH code when a user requests a connection. Searching for the optimum code set for each number of users in connection with the reasonable code set size incurs prohibitive computations even with a small alphabet sized modulation scheme such as BPSK or QPSK. The proposed search algorithm shows a tremendous reduction of computational time to search for optimum code sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088147.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"139 vol.1","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced search for optimum code sets to reduce PAPR in MC-CDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Radio broadcasting","Laboratories","Downlink","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Transmitters","Multiaccess communication","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","search problems","codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced search","optimum code sets","PAPR","MC-CDMA system","optimum Walsh-Hadamard code sets","minimum peak to average power ratio","multi-carrier CDMA system","code allocation table","modulation scheme","BPSK","QPSK","computational time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Reduced search for optimum code sets to reduce PAPR in MC-CDMA system","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1088147/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643929","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced search for optimum code sets to reduce PAPR in MC-CDMA system","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072532S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088148,"authors":[{"name":"P.

High spectral efficiency, robustness to channel fading, immunity to impulse interference, uniform average spectral density, capability of handling very strong echoes and less non linear distortion are among the favorite properties of OFDM. Even though there are many advantages of OFDM it has two main drawbacks: high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and frequency offset. In this paper, the issue of PAPR in OFDM is discussed. A new algorithm is proposed to reduce PAPR by scaling the input envelope for some sub carriers before they are sent to IFFT.

Another set of Walsh-Hadamard code sequences is used to spread the already spread signals at different antenna elements of an adaptive antenna array. These signals are accumulated and then converted by one A/D converter into the digital domain. By carefully selecting the Walsh-Hadamard code sequences the total quantization noise of the A/D converter is reduced. The extension of Meurer et al. scheme allows the use of a less powerful and cheaper A/D converter or it offers, by using the same A/D converter, the option of oversampling. The latter decreases the quantization noise of the A/D converter further.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088157","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088157.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"187 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving a CDMA radio system with an adaptive antenna array by exploiting multichannel enhancements of an A/D converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088157/","displayDocTitle":"Improving a CDMA radio system with an adaptive antenna array by exploiting multichannel enhancements of an A/D converter","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643939","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1088157/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving a CDMA radio system with an adaptive antenna array by exploiting multichannel enhancements of an A/D converter","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.259618S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088174,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The radio channels are statistically analyzed and the resulting PDFs (probability density functions) and CDFs (cumulated density functions) are compared against existing models. Furthermore, wind speeds and rain precipitation are correlated with the power samples to consider RF propagation dependencies. Second order statistics are derived including level crossing rate (LCR) and average facie duration (AFD). The power profile is analyzed for spectral components.

By using a numerical optimization procedure, we show how the statistical properties of the Q model and the corresponding simulation model can be adapted to those of an equivalent mobile satellite channel for an environment with heavy shadowing. It is demonstrated by several theoretical and simulation results that the Q model and the therefrom derived simulation model can provide excellent characterization for the corresponding measurement results with respect to the complementary cumulative distribution function (CDF), normalized LCR and ADF. Finally, it is shown that the Q model enables a better statistical fitting to the measurement data compared to the Rayleigh model due to the increased flexibility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Level-crossing rate and average duration of fades of deterministic simulation models for Nakagami-Hoyt fading channels","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088175","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23647/01088175.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"276 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Level-crossing rate and average duration of fades of deterministic simulation models for Nakagami-Hoyt fading channels","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1088175/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7643957","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Level-crossing rate and average duration of fades of deterministic simulation models for Nakagami-Hoyt fading channels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07137S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"23647","articleId":"1088175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088180,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Especially, at high data rates, i.e. with low spreading factors, not only does the interference rejection capability of the RAKE receiver decrease but also the diversity gain from combining the multipath components is drastically reduced. Therefore, in 3rd generation mobile radio systems based on direct-sequence code-division multiple access, the employment of more sophisticated demodulation techniques is indispensable for the provision of high data rates with a reasonable error performance. A comparison between three advanced WCDMA downlink detection algorithms is presented. Both uncoded and coded error performances in different scenarios are considered. Our simulation results indicate that almost the same performance level can be achieved by all three algorithms. Thus, the decision on which algorithm to use mainly depends upon implementation issues.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088195","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088195.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","startPage":"367","endPage":"371 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of advanced receivers for WCDMA downlink detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of advanced receivers for WCDMA downlink detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088195/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652418","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088195/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of advanced receivers for WCDMA downlink detection","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041639S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1088197,"authors":[{"name":"Tsungting Tsai","affiliation":["Wireless R/D, GVC InCorporation, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsungting Tsai","id":"37980012900"},{"name":"W.

Compared to conventional combining which uses MRC (maximum ratio combining), Wiener combining, which uses IRC (interference rejection combining), can get better MAI (multiple access interference) rejection. For an AWGN channel and R.H. Clarke's Rayleigh fading channel (see Bell Syst. Tech. J., vol.47, p.957-1000, 1968) with four independent paths, we simulate the BER performance of the RAKE receiver with a Wiener filter. From the simulation result, although we get about 1.5 dB performance degradation in AWGN and 6 to 7 dB degradation in the Rayleigh fading channel as compared to the ideal performance, its simplified algorithm can be an advantage in implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink RAKE receiver for WCDMA with Wiener filter","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088197","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088197.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"381 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Downlink RAKE receiver for WCDMA with Wiener filter","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1088197/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652420","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink RAKE receiver for WCDMA with Wiener filter","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03681S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1088198,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These MCS schemes are adaptively selected in response to channel propagation conditions. During the selection process, adaptive threshold values at the switching points are needed so that the maximum channel capacity is utilized in terms of bits/s/Hz. It has been suggested (see NEC and Telecom Modus, 3GPP TSG RAN WG1, Technical Document R1-01-0589, 2001) to use SIR as well as ACK/NACK information of the HARQ scheme to control threshold values that decide modulation and coding schemes. We further develop this algorithm to provide more stable, and hence higher, throughput results. In cooperation with ACK/NACK information of the HARQ scheme, the threshold values are only updated when the downlink SIR falls close (i.e. /spl plusmn//spl alpha/ dB) to one of the current threshold values of the received MCS level, otherwise the threshold value remains at its current level. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides a significant increase of throughput performance in different radio propagation conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of link adaptation for high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) in W-CDMA","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088198","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088198.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"386 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of link adaptation for high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) in W-CDMA","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1088198/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652421","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of link adaptation for high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) in W-CDMA","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036627S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088199,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The first is the conventional CDMA with closed loop power control with FEC coding and the second is S-ALOHA. In the latter, packets are transmitted in random slots at the full channel rate, therefore using bandwidth to achieve a random time spreading of packets. Both techniques use retransmissions when error occurs. The performance evaluation is obtained by simulation in order to consider a realistic cellular environment that takes into account the bursty nature of the inter-cell interference noise and its real statistics, which, in the S-ALOHA case where no spreading is used, is far from being normally distributed. The results presented show that the S-ALOHA approach, in the UMTS environment, achieves better bandwidth efficiency than CDMA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacities of ALOHA and power-controlled CDMA in the UMTS downlink channel","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088199","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088199.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"391 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"The capacities of ALOHA and power-controlled CDMA in the UMTS downlink channel","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1088199/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652422","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacities of ALOHA and power-controlled CDMA in the UMTS downlink channel","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079398S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088201,"authors":[{"name":"B.N.

However, the possibility of giving the promised efficiency with negligible or tolerable data error for the receiver is an issue to be considered as important as the theoretical efficiency. Quality aspects of MIMO systems in terms of BER are discussed and some results are documented for a Rayleigh fading channel. The channel is assumed known at the transmitter and the receiver, which might be possible in a TDD or FDD system with feedback and a quasi-stationary environment. It is also shown that it is possible to point a beam in the direction of few scatterers for an environment with no angular spread. The performance of space-time block coding (STBC) and V-BLAST is compared with our MIMO system model, which is based on SVD. The maximum eigenvalued channel attains the best possible performance in terms of BER.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088201.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"401 vol.2","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER and spectral efficiency of a MIMO system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Fading","Block codes","Space time codes","Base stations","Matrix decomposition","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","block codes","space-time codes","MIMO systems","Rayleigh channels","radio transmitters","radio receivers","singular value decomposition","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","diversity reception","quality of service","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","spectral efficiency","MIMO system","Rayleigh fading channel","TDD","FDD","space-time coding","space-time block coding","STBC","V-BLAST","SVD","eigenvalue","antenna diversity","transmit diversity","receive diversity","quality of service","eigenbeam forming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"BER and spectral efficiency of a MIMO system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1088201/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652424","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER and spectral efficiency of a MIMO system","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048617S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1088202,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The use of long-term spatial channel characteristics can improve channel estimation for MIMO wireless systems.

At the receiver this knowledge can be gained by state of the art training sequence based, semi-blind or blind channel estimation. However, at the transmitter the channel knowledge is not readily available and has to be imparted from the receiver by signaling the relevant information back to the transmitter, which ties up transmission resources. Therefore, a cost efficient signaling concept for this purpose is proposed, which relies on subspace methods. A quantitative example is discussed to show how this concept can be applied and how it performs in different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088213","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088213.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","startPage":"444","endPage":"448 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient representation and feedback signaling of channel state information in frequency division duplexing MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient representation and feedback signaling of channel state information in frequency division duplexing MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088213/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652434","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088213/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient representation and feedback signaling of channel state information in frequency division duplexing MIMO systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128799S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088214,"authors":[{"name":"Wooncheol Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wooncheol Hwang","id":"37358723000"},{"name":"Hongku Kang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hongku Kang","id":"37439718500"},{"name":"Yeongyoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Military Academy, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yeongyoon Choi","id":"37439075900"},{"name":"Kiseon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kiseon Kim","id":"37280247300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7442-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"1088214","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shadow mapping","Fading","OFDM","Diversity reception","System performance","Multipath channels","Bit error rate","Intersymbol interference","Large-scale systems","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","fading channels","correlation methods","multipath channels","diversity reception","signal detection","error statistics","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlated shadowing","multipath fading","OFDM systems","postdetection-combining-based macrodiversity","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","shadowed multipath channel","random multipath parameters","macrodiversity ports","link BER"]}],"abstract":"The performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) using postdetection-combining-based macrodiversity is analyzed on a shadowed multipath channel, and the effects of correlated shadowing are investigated.

The RACH structure and procedure as defined by 3GPP are not directly applicable for satellite-UMTS (S-UMTS) due to the different characteristics of the satellite channel. Based on the optimized schemes proposed for S-UMTS RACH, this paper investigates the issue of assigning services with different quality of service (QoS) requirements to different access service classes (ASCs). Such service differentiation is required in third generation wireless systems where multiple service classes with different QoS parameters are to be supported.

The COST259 DCM is a general model for the mobile radio channel that includes narrowband power (field strength), power delay profiles, and directions of arrival. For comparison purposes, it is desirable that the channel models forming the basis of earlier simulations are contained as special cases in the COST259 DCM. We show how a mixed stochastic/deterministic approach allows the GSM wideband models to be kept as special cases of COST259 DCM while still including new measurement results. The mean received powers agree with M. Hata's model (see IEEE Trans. on VT, vol.29, p.317-25, 1980) when proper averaging over stochastic variables is done. Finally, the shadowing distribution of the narrowband power is shown to agree with M.

Performance of the proposed algorithm and other algorithms in the technical literature are obtained in simulation and compared in different system scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call admission control in the uplink for WCDMA TDD systems","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088248","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088248.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"620 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Call admission control in the uplink for WCDMA TDD systems","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1088248/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652469","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call admission control in the uplink for WCDMA TDD systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038234S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088251,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Shin Cho","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Telecommunications and Computer Engineering, Hankuk Aviation University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ho-Shin Cho","id":"37075864100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7442-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"1088251","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":23},"abstract":"We consider the TD-CDMA/TDD multiple access scheme to support asymmetrical multimedia traffic between an uplink and downlink. The TD-CDAM/TDD scheme manages two-dimensional channel; time and code. The channel resource is divided by a switching-point on the time axis into uplink and downlink channels. Positioning the switching-point according to traffic load distributions on both uplink and downlink is very important to efficiently manage the channel resource. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to analyze the performance of TD-CDMA/TDD systems in terms of the call blocking probability and find the optimum switching-point to efficiently manage the channel resource considering the up/down traffic load distributions for various kinds of service applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23648/01088251.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"635 vol.2","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A strategy for time-slot assignment in TD-CDMA/TDD systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Telecommunication traffic","Resource management","Mathematical model","Performance analysis","Radio spectrum management","Traffic control","Telecommunication computing","Telecommunication switching","Multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time division multiplexing","code division multiple access","multimedia communication","telecommunication congestion control","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-slot assignment","TD-CDMA/TDD systems","asymmetrical multimedia traffic","uplink","downlink","two-dimensional channel","channel resource","switching-point","traffic load distributions","mathematical model","call blocking probability","up/down traffic load distributions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"A strategy for time-slot assignment in TD-CDMA/TDD systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1088251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652472","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A strategy for time-slot assignment in TD-CDMA/TDD systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057439S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23648","articleId":"1088251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1088255,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Effectiveness of antenna array to handle variable data rate is also briefly discussed. Based on the simulation results the performance in asynchronous uplink of the system is found to improve dramatically with the use of antenna arrays and multiuser detection techniques.

One of the important properties of proposed sequences is that any sequences in a sequence set have zero even cross-correlation with any sequences in another set for any time difference. By using the proposed sequences, the BER performance is significantly improved compared with that by conventional sequences with less number of interferences. Moreover, even if all (N) sequences are used simultaneously by different users, a practical BER performance is obtained. Although the proposed sequences have good cross correlation properties, the auto-correlation properties may be worse than general spreading sequences.

We study the performance of the maximum-likelihood multiuser receiver (MLMR) for a set of asynchronous independent users communicating with the base station. The framework of space-time coding is used to analyze the jointly coded users' signals. Based on the joint codeword distance matrix, we derive a new performance criterion for constructing codes. We prove that when the proposed criterion is satisfied, the MLMR for space-time coded DS-CDMA achieves the single user bound. We present numerical results that agree closely with the theoretical analysis.

The addition of this coding, adding both redundancy and frequency diversity, comes at a cost of reduced overall throughput (typically by a factor of 2). PO-CI/OFDM is as a new methodology to enhance performance in OFDM systems, via channel coding, without bandwidth expansion or decreased throughput. Specifically, by placing 2N symbols pseudo-orthogonally on the N OFDM carriers (via the use of spreading codes) and by introducing rate 1/2 convolutional coding, PO-CI/OFDM achieves the benefit of channel coding in OFDM without the cost of throughput reduction.

We investigate how dynamic base station assignment (DBSA) can be used to adjust RPC (i.e., DRPC). It is shown that DBSA coupled with DRPC can improve the system performance in terms of minimizing total mobile transmit power. In effect, the above approach attempts to operate the wireless network approximately with equal total received power.

It is shown from our simulations that the CEP-based power control strategy has looser E/sub b//N/sub 0/ requirement and it helps to increase the uplink capacity and extend the cell coverage when compared with the 3GPP-based method in slow and medium mobile speeds.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088313","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","startPage":"926","endPage":"930 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving transmit power control performance for WCDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving transmit power control performance for WCDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088313/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652532","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088313/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving transmit power control performance for WCDMA systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043561S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088314,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Handsets Laboratory, LG Electronics Emerald BD, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Hoon Kim","id":"37068776800"},{"name":"Sang Wu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Wu Kim","id":"37085287700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7442-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"1088314","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Silicon carbide","Bit error rate","Multiuser detection","Power system management","Dynamic range","Power amplifiers","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","telecommunication control","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","code division multiple access","multiuser channels","error statistics","spread spectrum communication","probability","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive interference cancellation","BER analysis","probability density function","PDF","cellular radio","DS/CDMA communications","code division multiple access","interference-limited system","interference management","transmission power control","geometrically distributed received power levels","dynamic range","power amplifier","power control commands step size/frequency"]}],"abstract":"It is well known that code division multiple access (CDMA) systems are interference-limited, and that the performance of CDMA systems depends on the success in managing the interference. Interference managements in terms of power control and interference cancellation have been investigated extensively in the past. We consider combining power control (PC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC), and show that the performance can be significantly improved by controlling the transmission power such that received power levels are geometrically distributed.

PC can be open loop power control (OLPC) or closed loop power control (CLPC), the latter one is preferable especially in presence of a real time traffic and fast fading channels.

When the number of allowable retransmissions is unlimited, transmitting the minimum amount of redundancy bits with each retransmission would result in the highest throughput as unnecessary redundancy is avoided. However in a practical system, the number of retransmissions allowed is limited to avoid unacceptable time delay before the successful transmission of a packet. When the number of retransmissions is limited, residual bit error is produced. In this paper, we consider different RCPT hybrid ARQ schemes with limited number of retransmissions. It is found that the type II hybrid ARQ scheme is the most favorable in terms of required E/sub b//N/sub 0/ for a given bit error rate (BER), while the type I hybrid ARQ scheme is the most favorable for delay sensitive systems. For the type II hybrid ARQ schemes, the minimum required E/sub b//N/sub 0/ is attained after all the parity bits are transmitted and hence depends on the puncturing period.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088322.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"975 vol.3","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of limited number of retransmissions of RCPT hybrid ARQ for DS-CDMA mobile radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio","Diversity reception","Redundancy","Bit error rate","Computer simulation","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Frequency conversion","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","error statistics","mobile radio","turbo codes","diversity reception","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["limited retransmissions","RCPT hybrid ARQ","DS-CDMA","mobile radio","signal energy per information bit","rate compatible punctured turbo code","direct sequence code division multiple access","antenna diversity reception","Rake combining","frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel","bit error rate","BER","type II hybrid ARQ scheme","type I hybrid ARQ scheme","delay sensitive systems","parity bits","puncturing period"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Effect of limited number of retransmissions of RCPT hybrid ARQ for DS-CDMA mobile radio","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1088322/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652541","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of limited number of retransmissions of RCPT hybrid ARQ for DS-CDMA mobile radio","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078416S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":1088325,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To design codes for this channel, we take a \"shortcut\" and instead design codes for the burst-erasure channel (BuEC) in which a bit is received correctly or it is received as an erasure, with erasures occurring in bursts. We show that optimal BuEC code ensembles are equal to optimal binary erasure channel (BEC) code ensembles and we design optimal codes for these channels. A given code on the BuEC may be characterized by the maximum resolvable erasure-burst length, L/sub max/, and we present a simple algorithm for computing this parameter.

The optimal values for /spl mu/ and /spl theta/ are derived. It is found that when the normalized frequency offset is large, up to 10dB improvement in CIR can be obtained by using the optimal /spl mu/.

The overall performance depends considerably on the type of signal mapping, and as an example, two types of mapping, referred to as the type-I and type-II, are proposed.

The purpose of the multi-rate OFDM system using adaptive modulation is to increase bandwidth efficiency by controlling constellation size and to adapt the proper service for each user according to channel conditions and the transmit power while maintaining the transmission's quality of service (QoS) at the receiver. A fixed-rate adaptive OFDM system only exploits instantaneous channel state information by using several modulation levels, but it is inappropriate to multi-rate multi-user services. On the contrary, the multi-rate adaptive OFDM system is very efficient for a multi-user system requiring various services, because this system exploits not only instantaneous channel state information but also the transmit power. Computer simulation results show that the capacity of the adaptive multi-rate OFDM system can be adaptively changed for various services.

According to the simulation results, the algorithm resolves CFO problems efficiently with reasonable complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088345","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1087 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization for carrier frequency offset in wireless LAN 802.11a system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization for carrier frequency offset in wireless LAN 802.11a system","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088345/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652564","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization for carrier frequency offset in wireless LAN 802.11a system","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032337S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088348,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The new scheme is designed to stop error propagation in the decoded video sequence originated by residual channel errors. Although our technique is general, we focus here on the problem of providing reliable video communication from wired users to mobile users in slow fading environments. This scenario has been shown to be the most critical due to long block error bursts present in the forward link of CDMA systems, and the inability of error resilience approaches incorporated in wired video codecs to guarantee an acceptable video quality in wireless transmissions. Numerical results show that our approach achieves important improvements in the quality of the decoded video.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088348","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","startPage":"1098","endPage":"1102 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New error resilience method for video transmission in DS-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New error resilience method for video transmission in DS-CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088348/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652567","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New error resilience method for video transmission in DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065089S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088351,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

However, after transmission through multipath fading channels, interference arises between different paths, leading to MPI (multi-path interference) in the DS-CDMA RAKE receiver. This, in turn, degrades the DS-CDMA system's probability of error performance. We propose a set of novel complex spreading codes called carrier interferometry (CI) codes, and we demonstrate how these novel orthogonal spreading codes achieve crosscorrelations independent of the phase offsets between different paths (after transmission over a multipath fading channel). This improved crosscorrelation property (relative to HW codes) leads to higher SIR in the DS-CDMA RAKE receiver, and, as a direct result, better performance in terms of probability of error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel orthogonal codes for DS-CDMA with improved crosscorrelation characteristics in multipath fading channels","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088354","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088354.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1132 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Novel orthogonal codes for DS-CDMA with improved crosscorrelation characteristics in multipath fading channels","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1088354/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652573","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel orthogonal codes for DS-CDMA with improved crosscorrelation characteristics in multipath fading channels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051993S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1088355,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Additionally, the service listing protocol can be completed using only wireless communications. Mobile users can quickly discover local available resources and services. Service providers can advertise their services to all people who are in the area and interested in those services. Our service listing protocol does not require high power or Web connectivity for the mobile users, making it quite appropriate for use by low-power devices such as PDA, laptop computers, and other handheld devices. Resources that could be advertised include computing resources such as currently unused processor cycles, disk space, printer/facsimile availability, and access to the greater Internet for purposes such as FTP, telnet, and other World Wide Web uses.

The proposed algorithms apply evolutionary computation algorithms from a phenotypic and a genotypic view to the CDMA power control problem. The major gain from the evolutionary computation algorithms is more rapid optimization on systems of linear equations compared with the simple genetic algorithm (SGA). Employing distributed constrained power control (DCPC) and bang-bang (BB) algorithms as the basic reference, we have designed and implemented computational experiments on the DS-CDMA system. The proposed EC-DCPC phenotypic algorithm is compared with the DCPC algorithm. The GA-DCPC genotypic algorithm is also compared with the BB algorithm used in IS-95 and W-CDMA systems. The simulation results indicate that the proposed EC-DCPC phenotypic and GA-DCPC genotypic algorithms significantly decrease mobile terminal power consumption compared with the DCPC and BB algorithms, respectively. The calculation results show that our proposed EC-DCPC phenotypic and GA-DCPC genotypic algorithms also have a high potential advantage for increasing CDMA cellular radio network capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088371.pdf","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1216 vol.3","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio resource management and evolutionary computation in CDMA cellular radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Evolutionary computation","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Power control","Genetic algorithms","Equations","Algorithm design and analysis","Distributed computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","telecommunication control","cellular radio","code division multiple access","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms","power consumption","spread spectrum communication","resource allocation","distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio resource management","evolutionary computation","CDMA cellular radio networks","distributed power control algorithms","genetic algorithm","linear equations","rapid optimization","distributed constrained power control","bang-bang algorithms","DS-CDMA system","phenotypic algorithm","genotypic algorithm","IS-95","W-CDMA","power consumption","radio network capacity","linear equation systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Radio resource management and evolutionary computation in CDMA cellular radio networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1088371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652590","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio resource management and evolutionary computation in CDMA cellular radio networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130767S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1088373,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

As a result, there is the optimum preamble pattern for bringing the probability of block error that takes into account the synchronization performance close to the lower bound.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Proposals","Amplitude modulation","Optical pulses","Spread spectrum communication","Data communication","Optical modulation","Optical noise","Bit error rate","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","pulse position modulation","pseudonoise codes","error statistics","AWGN channels","binary sequences","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time hopping","pulse spacing modulation","restricted amplitude levels","successive PN codes","bit error rate performance","synchronization","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel","pulse position modulation","E-sequences","pulse interval modulation","spread spectrum communications","optimum preamble pattern","block error probability","lower bound"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088383","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088383.pdf","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1274 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposal of a time-hopping pulse spacing modulation system with restricted amplitude levels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Proposal of a time-hopping pulse spacing modulation system with restricted amplitude levels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088383/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1088383/","accessionNumber":"7652602","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal of a time-hopping pulse spacing modulation system with restricted amplitude levels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045972S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1088387,"authors":[{"name":"Wooseok Yang","affiliation":["Department of Broadband Wireless Communication,Radio & Broadcasting Research Laboratory, ETRI, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wooseok Yang","id":"38183456000"},{"name":"Kwonhue Choi","affiliation":["Department of Broadband Wireless Communication,Radio & Broadcasting Research Laboratory, ETRI, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwonhue Choi","id":"38488820000"},{"name":"Sooyoung Kim Shin","affiliation":["Department of Broadband Wireless Communication,Radio & Broadcasting Research Laboratory, ETRI, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sooyoung Kim Shin","id":"37335431800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7442-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"1088387","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Adaptive systems","Null space","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Throughput","Channel estimation","Broadband communication","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","channel estimation","adaptive modulation","error statistics","thermal noise","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel quality estimation","OFDM system","adaptive transmission","transmission throughput","BER performance","signal to interference ratio","SIR","channel estimation error","channel gain matrix","thermal noise variance","total interference power"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive transmission to the channel conditions has been shown to considerably improve the BER performance as well as transmission throughput. Application of the adaptive transmission technique to the OFDM system has been considered in many areas in order to utilize the advantage of the adaptive schemes.

In this paper, we propose a channel quality estimation technique for adaptive OFDM systems which suffer from interference due to channel estimation error and thermal noise. The proposed scheme estimates the variance of thermal noise by using the null space of the channel gain matrix in an OFDM symbol first, then evaluates the total interference power from the estimated thermal noise variance.

In order to estimate the complex OFDM channel amplitudes, the estimation algorithms usually rely on the pilot signal assisted modulation (PSAM).

This way, the quality of the initial channel estimation can be significantly increased without the need of using additional pilot symbols. The proposed algorithm is tested on a selection of different time and frequency selective fading channels based on Rayleigh fading discrete taps of an exponentially decaying average power delay profile. We compare the performance of our algorithm with other channel estimation techniques for two different sizes of the data frame and demonstrate gains in order of 1-2 dB. We also show that our algorithm is better suited for fast changing, highly frequency-selective channels.","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088389","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088389.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","startPage":"1299","endPage":"1303 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation and turbo decoding for OFDM-based systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation and turbo decoding for OFDM-based systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088389/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652608","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088389/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation and turbo decoding for OFDM-based systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053685S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1088390,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

We propose an iterative algorithm to efficiently estimate the channel impulse response (CIR) of a clipped OFDM system operating in an environment with a multipath fading channel and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A tight lower bound on the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation is given both by analysis and simulation. The iterative channel estimation algorithm is capable of improving the channel estimate by making use of pilot tones or using the channel estimate of the previous frame to obtain the initial estimate for the iterative procedure. In each iteration, nonlinear distortion is estimated and compensated assuming the nonlinear characteristic is known.

The number of pilot tones needed exceeds the maximum length of the channel delay (normalized to the symbol period) by one. The best estimate of the channel values in between pilots can be acquired by an IFFT, zero padding and an FFT. Such an estimator gives perfect estimate of the channel in the absence of noise and synchronization errors. However, in the presence of frame synchronization errors, its performance degrades, especially for timing offsets to the right. In this paper, we analyze the sensitivity of such channel estimator to frame synchronization errors, explaining how it is more affected by timing offsets to the right than those to the left. Then through utilizing this sensitivity, we propose a low complexity method to correct frame synchronization errors, which can improve the performance considerably without a need for added training overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088391.pdf","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1313 vol.3","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of frame synchronization errors on pilot-aided channel estimation in OFDM: analysis and solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Delay estimation","Timing","AWGN","Degradation","Frequency estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Semiconductor device noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","synchronisation","OFDM modulation","fast Fourier transforms","delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame synchronization errors","pilot-aided channel estimation","OFDM","channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","pilot tones","delay spread","channel delay","IFFT","zero padding","FFT","performance","timing offsets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"Effect of frame synchronization errors on pilot-aided channel estimation in OFDM: analysis and solution","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1088391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652610","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of frame synchronization errors on pilot-aided channel estimation in OFDM: analysis and solution","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077516S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088392,"authors":[{"name":"Qihong Ge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qihong Ge","id":"37984526400"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianhua Lu","id":"37278637500"},{"name":"Shunflang Mei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shunflang Mei","id":"37276289600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7442-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1347-6890"}],"articleNumber":"1088392","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Convolution","Channel estimation","Fading","Intersymbol interference","Time domain analysis","Baseband","Signal processing","Demodulation","Interference elimination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Walsh functions","fast Fourier transforms","equalisers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise-resilient equalization","OFDM systems","frequency-domain equalization","channel noise","performance","Walsh transform"]}],"abstract":"The complex time-domain equalization can be replaced by simple frequency-domain equalization in OFDM systems.

In all cases there is a strong gain that allows usage of modulations at least one order of magnitude greater at a very limited additional computational cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088393.pdf","startPage":"1318","endPage":"1322 vol.3","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FCM receiver improved with reference symbols exploitation for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Demodulation","Partitioning algorithms","Testing","Digital video broadcasting","Prototypes","Intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","Computational efficiency","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","receivers","intersymbol interference","channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FCM receiver","reference symbols","OFDM systems","clustering-based receivers","multicarrier environment","pilot symbol insertion","OFDM frame","phase rotations","intersymbol interference","channel estimation","modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"FCM receiver improved with reference symbols exploitation for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1088393/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652612","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FCM receiver improved with reference symbols exploitation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039688S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1088396,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

The dispersion caused by multipath requires some kind of accommodation by using available resources; prefixes use extra time and/or energy. The goal of this paper is to show how extra space (via multiple transmit antenna elements) can also be used. This paper first introduces a synchronous dispersive multi-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel model. Due to dispersion, any single SISO (single-input single-output) block is full column-rank and thus has an empty null space. However, under certain conditions, when enough receive antenna elements are employed, the null space becomes richer; ultimately, the matrix becomes full row-rank. Based on this idea, we identify sufficient conditions for zero-forcing of the inter-block interference. Finally, we propose an approach for the construction of near-optimum signal sets to achieve zero-forcing precoding.","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088396.pdf","startPage":"1333","endPage":"1336 vol.3","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088396","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088396","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088396","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Interference","OFDM","Null space","Transmitters","Adaptive arrays","Sufficient conditions","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","space-time codes","equalisers","multiuser channels","dispersive channels","MIMO systems","receiving antennas","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoding","inter-block interference","IBI","multipulse communication","OFDM","space-time zero-forcing","pre-equalization","synchronous dispersive multiuser channels","multi-input multi-output channel","MIMO channel model","SISO block","single-input single-output block","receive antenna elements","null space","full row-rank matrix","near-optimum signal sets","interference suppression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088396/","displayDocTitle":"Space-time zero-forcing pre-equalization for synchronous dispersive multi-user channels","accessionNumber":"7652615","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1088396/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","volume":"3","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time zero-forcing pre-equalization for synchronous dispersive multi-user channels","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041942S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1088399,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper proposes a hybrid MIMO system that mitigates the throughput loss in highly correlated propagation channels. In the proposed system, the transmitter uses the spatial multiplexing scheme or the selection transmit diversity scheme according to information fed back from the receiver. The receiver determines which of the two transmission schemes provides higher throughput from the metrics of the spatial correlation and signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the channel. We define the spatial correlation for MIMO channels, and by computer simulations obtain throughput loss as a function of spatial correlation for the spatial multiplexing scheme. The obtained data is used for transmission scheme selection. Since the feedback information contains only commands of the selected transmission scheme and symbol constellation size, bandwidth loss due to the feedback is acceptable. Simulation results show that by using spatial correlation the proposed system can switch from the spatial multiplexing scheme to the transmit diversity scheme in highly correlated propagation environments, and so mitigate the severe throughput loss which occurs in conventional nonhybrid spatial multiplexing MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid MIMO system using spatial correlation","publicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","doi":"10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088399","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8154/23649/01088399.pdf","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1350 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPMC.2002.1088399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid MIMO system using spatial correlation","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1088399/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7652618","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid MIMO system using spatial correlation","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1088399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061772S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8154","isNumber":"23649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8154","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"23649","articleId":"1088399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1088410,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, as signal bandwidth increases particularly in multicarrier spread spectrum systems, memory effects become more severe. These effects result from the frequency response of matching networks, nonlinear capacitances of the transistors and the response of the bias networks. Multi-stage high power amplifiers require a more accurate behavioural model to provide a better description of memory effects and highly nonlinear characteristics than the memoryless models based on single-tone transfer characteristics. This is achieved using measured two-tone transfer characteristics of the amplitude and phase of the fundamental, IM3 and IM5 components, which includes highly nonlinear components that represent the amplifier's significant memory. A statistical technique is then applied to predict spectral regrowth of a multicarrier signal due to the nonlinearity of the PA using the autocorrelation moments of the signal and the derived behavioural model. This statistical method allows accurate, fast and efficient prediction of the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of the communication system without time-consuming time-domain simulations.","doi":"10.1109/HFPSC.2002.1088421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HFPSC.2002.1088421","startPage":"10 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"7th IEEE High Frequency Postgraduate Student Colloquium","pdfPath":"/iel5/8155/23650/01088421.pdf","publicationTitle":"7th IEEE High Frequency Postgraduate Student Colloquium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACPR prediction of multi-carrier systems through behavioural modelling of power amplifiers using measured two-tone transfer characteristics and statistical techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"ACPR prediction of multi-carrier systems through behavioural modelling of power amplifiers using measured two-tone transfer characteristics and statistical techniques","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2002","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1088421/","accessionNumber":"7562320","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088421/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACPR prediction of multi-carrier systems through behavioural modelling of power amplifiers using measured two-tone transfer characteristics and statistical techniques","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1088421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038833S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8155","isNumber":"23650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8155","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"23650","articleId":"1088421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088544,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In view of the time-variant phase characteristics of fading channels, some form of instantaneous phase correction must be provided prior to the diversity combining so that proper in-phase addition will result. If the instantaneous fading is not uniform over the width of the channel, the resulting channel incoherence will reduce the efficacy of the phase correction. One way to avoid this difficulty is to divide the selectively fading channel into \"flatly\" fading subchannels and perform the necessary phasing and combining operations per subchannel. The question arises as to how much frequency selective fading can be tolerated within a channel, or a subchannel, before serious deterioration in performance results. This paper considers this question with reference to FDM-SSB binary data transmission and matched filter reception, wherein a pilot tone is used both for deriving proper phase correction and for providing the weighting necessary for maximal ratio combining. Analytical expressions are derived for error probabilities which show the deleterious effects of frequency selectivity and pilot tone additive noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088632/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1962","volume":"10","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"March 1962","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Predetection Diversity Combining with Selectively Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predetection Diversity Combining with Selectively Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"01088632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033657S","chronDate":"March  1962","isNumber":"23659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547465","citationCount":"85","articleId":"1088632","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1088634,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This slow fading assumption is removed in the present paper which derives general expressions for the binary error probabilities of incoherent and differentially coherent matched filter receivers employing post-detection diversity combining. In the analysis it is assumed that the transmitted signals occupy a bandwidth much smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the medium so that \"flat\" fading may be assumed. In addition, it is assumed that the amplitude and phase fluctuations produced by the medium have the same statistical character as those of narrow-band Gaussian noise. The general analytical results are specialized to the cases of frequency shift keying using incoherent detection, and phase shift keying using differentially coherent detection, and to the cases of exponential and Gaussian fading correlation functions. For these special cases, signal-to-noise degradation curves are given as a function of fading bandwidth. The PSK system is degraded more rapidly with increasing fading bandwidth than is the FSK system. Curves are given which show the error probabilities and corresponding fading bandwidths for which the noncoherent FSK and the differentially coherent PSK systems break even. For lower error probabilities or higher fading bandwidths, the FSK system becomes superior to the PSK system in the sense of being able to provide the same error probability with less signal-to-noise ratio. The existence of an irreducible error probability is demonstrated for the incoherent and differentially coherent matched filter receivers. Thus, in general, an increase in transmitted signal power cannot reduce the error probability below a certain value depending upon the fading spectrum and order of diversity. Theoretical curves of irreducible error probability are given for the incoherent FSK and differentially coherent PSK systems. An important result of the analysis is that the shape of the fading spectrum can make a significant difference in the amount of signal-to-noise degradation. The results of the analysis also indicate that care must be exercised in employing a \"slow fading\" assumption since, if low bit error probabilities are desired, significant degradations in performance can occur even though the fading rate is quite low relative to the data rate.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1962.1088654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1962.1088654","startPage":"160","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547465/23660/01088654.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of Fading Spectrum on the Binary Error Probabilites of Incoherent and Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Recievers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1962","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1962","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of Fading Spectrum on the Binary Error Probabilites of Incoherent and Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Recievers","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"June 1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of Fading Spectrum on the Binary Error Probabilites of Incoherent and Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Recievers","sourcePdf":"01088654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02758S","chronDate":"June  1962","isNumber":"23660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547465","citationCount":"109","articleId":"1088654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1088659,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Small passive reflectors of the \"periscope type\" have been used for many years on microwave systems. Large passive reflectors have also been used but to a much lesser degree. Large passives may be used at intermediate points on long (200 miles or more) microwave links in lieu of active repeaters. Most microwave engineers have little knowledge of system engineering using these reflectors. This paper describes their use in both the \"near\" and \"far fields\" in line-of-sight systems and describes how they may be used on non-line-of-sight systems (tropospheric scatter and diffraction systems). Formulas are developed and graphs provided which will enable the microwave engineer to determine the path loss of multihop passive reflector systems. Large passive reflectors should be considered as another tool which can be used by the microwave engineer for planning and engineering communications systems. When used effectively with line-of-sight, diffraction and tropospheric scatter modes of propagation, communication systems may be engineered more economically, with more reliability and with a decrease in the operating and maintenance problems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23661","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547465/23661/01088659.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1962.1088659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1962.1088659","startPage":"304","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave System Engineering Using Large Passive Reflectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1962","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088659/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave System Engineering Using Large Passive Reflectors","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"September 1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave System Engineering Using Large Passive Reflectors","sourcePdf":"01088659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035103S","chronDate":"September  1962","isNumber":"23661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547465","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1088659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088663,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This performance is achieved through a new system design rather than a less subtle method, such as carrier reinsertion. It is well known that a single-sideband signal can be represented as a combination of amplitude and phase-modulated signals. Most methods of single-sideband generation do not allow separate control of the amplitude and phase modulation. However, in the system described in this paper the amplitude and phase-modulation components are generated separately and have a specific functional relationship with each other. The amplitude-modulation envelope is the square root of the waveform to be transmitted and the phase modulation is the Hilbert transform of the logarithm of the envelope. A signal generated in this manner will occupy a bandwidth equal to the bandwidth of the original modulating signal and may be received without distortion with a square-law envelope detector. Tests on the system have shown that it is possible to obtain [1] an average of 25-db sideband rejection using band-limited white noise as the modulating signal, and [2] an average of 2 per cent harmonic distortion and 9 per cent intermodulation distortion using a square-law detector.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1962.1088663","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547465/23661/01088663.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1962.1088663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Square-Law Single-Sideband System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1962","displayDocTitle":"The Square-Law Single-Sideband System","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 1962","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Square-Law Single-Sideband System","sourcePdf":"01088663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049933S","chronDate":"September  1962","isNumber":"23661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547465","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1088663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088668,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, the basic theory of FM demodulation with frequency-compressive feedback (FCF) is presented after a brief discussion of the concept of noise threshold and of the usefulness of threshold reduction techniques in relaxing important requirements in the design of reliable communication systems. It is shown that the simultaneous presence of distortion and open-loop phase shift sets an upper bound on the amount of feedback that may be applied before inducing a rapid deterioration of system performance. This upper bound may fall well below the upper bound imposed by Nyquist's stability criterion. Thus, although the system may be stable in the usual sense, it may be incapable of tracking an applied FM signal either because of insufficient compressive action or because of open-loop phase shift that causes the distortion to rise with increased feedback. It is also shown that the system may be modeled (only approximately) by a linear feedback circuit provided that both the applied compressive action is sufficient to reduce the deviation ratio to a value much less than unity, and the SNR at the input of the feedback circuit exceeds or equals the threshold of linear output-input\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S/N</tex>\nrelationship for a conventional FM demodulator. The linear dependence of the output SNR upon the input SNR is shown to be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the validity of the linear model. It is shown in this paper that the threshold of linear variation of the output SNR with the input SNR for an amplitude-insensitive FM demodulator with frequency-compressive feedback (FCF), driven directly from the linear stages of the receiver, is equivalent to that of a conventional FM demodulator that is driven from a noise bandwidth equal to one-third of the closed-loop noise bandwidth, or to the loop band-pass filter noise bandwidth, whichever is larger. When the closed-loop noise bandwidth is larger than three times the band-pass filter noise bandwidth, the band-pass filter bandwidth can be widened until it equals one third of the closed-loop noise bandwidth without changing the closed-loop noise bandwidth, provided a permissible compensating change is introduced in the loop low-pass filter. If this is done, the system will be able to accept a signal of wider deviation ratio and hence give better high\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S/N</tex>\nperformance with the same threshold. In this sense, the FCF loop may be said to be optimized relative to the input signal if with the amount of feedback that is necessary to compress the frequency of the signal by the maximum permissible amount, the closed-loop noise bandwidth is equal to three times the noise bandwidth of the loop band-pass filter. The introduction of an amplitude limiter in front of the FCF loop is shown to raise the threshold of linear output vs input SNR back to the corresponding threshold of a conventional FM demodulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088673/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1962","publicationDate":"September 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Theory of FM Demodulation with Frequency-Compressive Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Theory of FM Demodulation with Frequency-Compressive Feedback","sourcePdf":"01088673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077235S","chronDate":"September  1962","isNumber":"23661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547465","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1088673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088681,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Since most input signals are continuous, the conversion cannot be accomplished without an error which, for many cases, may be considered to have the characteristics of white noise. A method has been suggested to reduce this error by using linear feedback around the quantizer to shape the noise spectrum. Each output sample will then contain not only signal information but also information about the errors in the previous samples. Such a system is analyzed for random input signals of a rather general nature. Under assumptions allowing essentially no clipping in the quantizer and setting an upper bound on the coherence between samples of the input signal, the system can be represented by a simple model. A comparison is made of the mean-square error with and without feedback. It is shown that considerable reduction in noise power can be obtained by a slight increase in sampling rate. For example, an increase of 25 per cent in the sampling rate provides a 95 per cent decrease in error-noise power. This is equivalent to having about two additional bits per sample in the transmission channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"December 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"10","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Quantizing Noise by Use of Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Quantizing Noise by Use of Feedback","sourcePdf":"01088681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067259S","chronDate":"December  1962","isNumber":"23662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547465","citationCount":"87","articleId":"1088681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1088687,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Various diversity techniques are compared by calculating the number of decibels by which transmitter power would have to be increased to achieve performance equivalent to that of the maximal-ratio combiner, which is the optimum. The same comparison is shown to hold, at the low SNR's that are of greatest practical interest, for a number of different types of fading, including Rayleigh fading of unequal mean strengths on the various branches, correlated Rayleigh fading, and certain nonRayleigh types. Constant-gain combination, which is a generalization of equalgain combination, is discussed.

Surprisingly little analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of frequency-selective fading on digital (or analog) communication systems. This paper considers the effect of frequency-selective fading on the binary error probabilities of incoherent and differentially coherent matched filter receivers employing postdetection diversity combining. In the analysis it is assumed that the fading is slow enough so that over a few bits at least the channel transfer function remains constant. In addition, it is assumed that the amplitude and phase fluctuations on a received carrier have the same statistical character as those of narrow-band Gaussian noise. The general analytical results are specialized to the cases of frequency-shift keying using incoherent detection, and phase-shift keying using differentially coherent detection for the case of a Gaussian frequency autocorrelation function. For these special cases, signal-to-noise degradation curves are given as a function of the ratio of the binary data rate to the correlation (or coherence) bandwidth. Two types of FSK are considered, phase-continuous and phase-discontinuous. In phase-continuous FSK there is no discontinuity in the phase of the transmitted waveform at the markspace or space-mark epochs. Such an FSK system results when the mark and space frequencies are obtained by frequency modulating an oscillator. In phase-discontinuous FSK phase discontinuities exist at the transition epochs. Such an FSK system results, for example, when the mark and space frequencies are derived by switching between two independent oscillators. An interesting result of the analysis is that the differentially coherent PSK system and the phase-discontinuous FSK system degrade considerably more rapidly with increasing (normalized) data rate than the phasecontinuous FSK system. The existence of an irreducible error probability is demonstrated for the incoherent and differentially coherent matched filter receivers. Thus, in general, an increase in transmitted signal power cannot reduce the error probability below a certain value depending upon the ratio of data rate to correlation bandwidth and order of diversity. Theoretical curves of irreducible error probability are given for the incoherent FSK and differentially coherent PSK systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1963.1088747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547466/23665/01088747.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1963.1088747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Frequency Selective Fading on the Binary Error Probabilities of Incoherent and Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1963","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1963","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Frequency Selective Fading on the Binary Error Probabilities of Incoherent and Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Receivers","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1963","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Frequency Selective Fading on the Binary Error Probabilities of Incoherent and Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Receivers","sourcePdf":"01088747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041445S","chronDate":"June  1963","isNumber":"23665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547466","citationCount":"173","articleId":"1088747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1088753,"authors":[{"name":"W.

From my own standpoint, the chairman feels that the most significant thing which this panel can accomplish is to cause a general awakening among engineers to the fact that there is a synchronization problem, and that it exists both as a theoretical and as a practical problem, and to stimulate thinking in both circles with the ultimate view toward finding a common framework in which the theoreticians are happy to work and from which the practical communications system designers can readily borrow. I believe that this is a goal which is obtainable and one toward which many in the audience here today are capable of contributing.

At the outset it is demonstrated that time-varying linear channels (or filters) may be characterized in an interesting symmetrical manner in time and frequency variables by arranging system functions in (timefrequency) dual pairs. Following this a statistical characterization of randomly time-variant linear channels is carried out in terms of correlation functions for the various system functions. These results are specialized by considering three classes of practically interesting channels. These are the wide-sense stationary (WSS) channel, the uncorrelated scattering (US) channel, and the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel. The WSS and US channels are shown to be (time-frequency) duals. Previous discussions of channel correlation functions and their relationships have dealt exclusively with the WSSUS channel. The point of view presented here of dealing with the dually related system functions and starting with the unrestricted linear channels is considerably more general and places in proper perspective previous results on the WSSUS channel. Some attention is given to the problem of characterizing radio channels. A model called the Quasi-WSSUS channel is presented to model the behavior of such channels. All real-life channels and signals have an essentially finite number of degrees of freedom due to restrictions on time duration and bandwidth. This fact may be used to derive useful canonical channel models with the aid of sampling theorems and power series expansions.

The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088883/","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1964","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Distributed Communications Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Distributed Communications Networks","sourcePdf":"01088883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025319S","chronDate":"March  1964","isNumber":"23673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547466","citationCount":"429","articleId":"1088883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1088888,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In general, the receiver acquires this knowledge from sighals received previously over the channel. The result of this measurement process is a noisy phase reference which is then used by the receiver in the detection of the incoming signals. In this paper the effect of using baud decisions to direct the phase measurement process (decision-directed measurement) is investigated by means of Monte Carlo computer simulation of a coherent, binary communication system employing either orthogonal or phase-reversal signaling. The results are compared with those obtained from similar systems using nondecision-directed measurement. Analytical verification of the computer results is provided for particular cases. Error rates are given at several signal-to-noise ratios. The central conclusion of this study is that detection using a phase reference obtained through the decision-directed technique outlined herein results in system error rates which are generally lower, at all signal-to-noise ratios, than error rates of corresponding nondecision-directed phase measurement schemes. A \"run-away\" phenomenon, in which the receiver by committing errors loses the reference phase and never regains it, is not encountered.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547466/23673/01088888.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Coherent Detection Systems Using Decision-Directed Channel Measurement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1964","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Coherent Detection Systems Using Decision-Directed Channel Measurement","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1964","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Coherent Detection Systems Using Decision-Directed Channel Measurement","sourcePdf":"01088888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045051S","chronDate":"March  1964","isNumber":"23673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547466","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1088888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088891,"authors":[{"name":"B.

An adaptable fading model is constructed as follows. First, a certain short-term fading distribution (Rayleigh, singular or Rice) is assumed. Then the mean power of this short-term distribution is allowed to possess a long-term variation. The statistics of this variation are assumed to be describable by some gamma distribution. This suffices to derive the binary element error probabilities for a number of receiver types. Particular emphasis is placed on the noncoherent FSK. The performance of more significant ideal receivers is displayed in analytical and graphical forms. Let us select a fixed value of signal-to-noise ratio, possibly a large number. It is shown that the choice of a single parameter suffices to give any error probability up to the extreme value of one half. Such a channel, therefore, can be arbitrarily bad, no matter what the signal-to-noise ratio. It is conjectured that the effects of this peculiar fading, possibly more than the non-Gaussian character of atmospheric noise, may be chiefly responsible for intolerable error rates on fading high frequency radio circuits. For the purpose of utility, it should be noted that the nonfading shortterm model is mathematically most tractable.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547466/23673/01088896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23673","startPage":"64","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary Error Probability Due to an Adaptable Fading Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Binary Error Probability Due to an Adaptable Fading Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1964","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1964","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Error Probability Due to an Adaptable Fading Model","sourcePdf":"01088896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037881S","chronDate":"March  1964","isNumber":"23673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547466","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1088896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1088898,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is shown that output signal-to-noise ratios may be obtained which increase exponentially as a function of the channel signal-to-noise ratio in the bandwidth of the source. Lower bounds on the maximum exponent for an optimized system are obtained for conventional PCM, for coded PCM with no coding delay and for coded PCM with arbitrarily large delay. Improved performance is obtained at the cost of considerable expansion of the modulated bandwidth over the source bandwidth. Expressions for the bandwidth expansion for these systems are also obtained. Mention is made of the similarity of these exact results for digital systems to recent approximate results for analog modulation systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547466/23673/01088901.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower Bounds on Maximum Signal-to-Noise Ratios for Digital Communication Over the Gaussian Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1964","displayDocTitle":"Lower Bounds on Maximum Signal-to-Noise Ratios for Digital Communication Over the Gaussian Channel","volume":"12","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088901/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1964","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower Bounds on Maximum Signal-to-Noise Ratios for Digital Communication Over the Gaussian Channel","sourcePdf":"01088901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064166S","chronDate":"March  1964","isNumber":"23673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547466","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1088901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1088904,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It was found that coupled cavity tubes exhibit better intermodulation distortion properties (by a factor of 5 or 6 db) than helix tubes. By employing a direct narrow-band feedback loop around a helix TWT, intermodulation distortion can be reduced by the amount of available loop gain. Both third-order distortion and noise-power ratio NPR measurements were made as a function of TWT output power. By using feedback techniques, it appears that a TWT ground transmitter could be made with sufficiently low distortion to satisfy CCIR requirements in the overall ground-spacecraft system without the use of compandors.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088904","startPage":"150","endPage":"159","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547466/23674/01088904.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Amplifier Linearity Studies for SSB Transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1964","displayDocTitle":"Power Amplifier Linearity Studies for SSB Transmissions","publicationDate":"June 1964","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088904/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Amplifier Linearity Studies for SSB Transmissions","sourcePdf":"01088904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017386S","chronDate":"June  1964","isNumber":"23674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547466","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1088904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1088911,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The intuitive arguments are plausible, since these receivers obtain their reference from past bits. To put these arguments on a firmer ground, an analysis of this phenomenon was undertaken. It is shown that when the cause of errors is additive Gaussian noise the ratio of double-errors to single errors is less than 25 per cent when the SNR is larger than 5db. As a matter of fact, this ratio approaches zero as the SNR increases without bound. This analytical result was verified experimentally using a practical data set.

This reference may be either locally generated or transmitted simultaneously with the data. The latter system completely avoids the synchronization problem of locally generated reference systems but is degraded by the fact that two receivers are required, excess system dimension must be used, and the transmitter power is diluted by having to transmit the reference. This report is a study of a general transmitted reference (TR) system, with the primary objective of finding bounds on these restrictions. It is based upon geometrical considerations using the fact that a transmitted reference system can be described by vectors in, and linear transformations upon, an\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</tex>\n-dimensional Euclidean space. In this way it can be shown, for example, that the dimension of the transmitting channel must be greater than that of the space of carrier signals for unique operation. This increase in dimension need be only slight in the noiseless case, but an advantage is gained by increasing the dimension in noisy operation. An equivalent expression for output SNR is obtained in terms of norms of signal vectors and a comparison is made with that of a locally generated reference (LGR) system. It is shown that a TR system always operates with at least a 3-dB poorer SNR than that of an ideal LGR system, with the bound increasing to 6 dB if the transmitter is power limited, and gets progressively worse as the transmitter power to noisepower ratio decreases below 0 dB. Some curves are plotted to show these relationships quantitatively.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23676/01088960.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Geometrical Study of Transmitted Reference Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1964","displayDocTitle":"A Geometrical Study of Transmitted Reference Communication Systems","volume":"12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Geometrical Study of Transmitted Reference Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"01088960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015232S","chronDate":"December  1964","isNumber":"23676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"40","articleId":"1088960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1088964,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In proposing the following model, four characteristic assumptions apply to ther eceived noise: 1) The disturbance is of short enough duration so that the receiver. 2) Separate responses do not overlap in time. 3) Response amplitude is defined as the absolute maximum voltage occuring at the measuring point in the receiver during the given complete response. 4) A response is only considered to be an impulse noise response when its amplitudee xceeds a certaint hreshold value. The model seems to satisfy a degree of physical intuition and may thus serve as a support to the experimentally formulated approsirnation models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23676/01088971.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"222","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified physical model for amplitude distribution of impulsive noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1964","displayDocTitle":"A simplified physical model for amplitude distribution of impulsive noise","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1964","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified physical model for amplitude distribution of impulsive noise","sourcePdf":"01088971.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017139S","chronDate":"December  1964","isNumber":"23676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","articleId":"1088971","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":1088973,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The extraction of information from the carrier requires the synchronization of a pseudonoise waveform at the receiver for correlation detection. For initial synchronization, the receiver must examine all possible time positions of the incoming pseudonoise waveform. In serial search the time difference between the pseudonoise modulation on the carrier and the pseudonoise waveform generated at the receiver is linearly varied. A continuous decision process determines when synchronization has been achieved. With additive white normal noise interference, the probabilities of false alarm and false dismissal during synchronization for coherent and incoherent detection are computed. The results are dependent on carrier power, noise per unit bandwidth, and search rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 1964","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Serial Synchronization of Pseudonoise Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Serial Synchronization of Pseudonoise Systems","sourcePdf":"01088974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041162S","chronDate":"December  1964","isNumber":"23676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"43","articleId":"1088974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":1088975,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Several options for interpreting garbled service information were considered and the corresponding formulas for R and \u03c1 were obtained. Block diagrams are presented which show the possible sequences of events and their probabilities for each type of logic. Analysis of the third logic required models based on seven-state and ten-state Markov processes. Tractable formulas were not obtainable in closed form but only as solutions to matrix equations.

These evaluations are based on the analysis in the companion paper which admits errors in the feedback channel and undetectable errors in either channel. The basic problem of deciding whether to use retransmission or forward error-correction for a particular application is investigated. The areas of relative superiority based on throughput rate R and uncorrected error rate \u03c1 for each type of error control are determined for a wide range of codes and channels. It is shown that in almost all burst error cases and in independent error channels with low error probabilities, retransmission sytsems are superior to forward error-correcting systems in both throughput rate R and undetected error rate \u03c1. In independent error channels with high error rates forward error correction shows substantial improvement over retransmission provided that extremely high reliability is not required. It is shown that in designing a retransmission logic, the decision to interpret garbled messages bearing service information as retransmission requests lowers the throughput rate slightly but improves the reliability considerably. The problem of selecting one of the basic retransmission logics for a particular application is also considered. The systems characteristics of the logics were seen to be the prime consideration in many cases since the differences in R and \u03c1 are generally not substantial.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Error analysis","Throughput","Forward error correction","Error correction codes","Feedback","Error probability","Logic design","Performance analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1088976","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088976","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23676/01088976.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1964.1088976","startPage":"146","endPage":"154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparisons of Error Control Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparisons of Error Control Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1088976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1964","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"December 1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparisons of Error Control Techniques","sourcePdf":"01088976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035979S","chronDate":"December  1964","isNumber":"23676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1088976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1088977,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This will be achieved by introducing the concept of \"self-similar stochastic point process in continuous time.\" The resulting mechanism presents fascinating peculiarities from the mathematical viewpoint. In order to make them more palatable as well as to help in the search for further developments, the basic concept of \"conditional stationarity\" will be discussed in greater detail than would be strictly necessary from the viewpoint of the immediate engineering problem of errors of transmission. This work is related to an earlier \"new model\" due to J. M. Berger and the author; the logical structure of the theory has been further streamlined and a number of fresh consequences have been derived; the empirical fit has been further improved, while recourse to ad hoc corrective terms was made unnecessary.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1965.1089090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23683/01089090.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1965.1089090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Similar Error Clusters in Communication Systems and the Concept of Conditional Stationarity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1965","displayDocTitle":"Self-Similar Error Clusters in Communication Systems and the Concept of Conditional Stationarity","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Similar Error Clusters in Communication Systems and the Concept of Conditional Stationarity","sourcePdf":"01089090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052407S","chronDate":"March  1965","isNumber":"23683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"117","articleId":"1089090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1089106,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The important feature of the technique is the method of combining the pseudorandom waveform with the FM signal so that one component of the AM channel-sounding spectrum is stationary and unaffected by the frequency modulation. Coherent detection and cross correlation are used at the receiver to recover the \"transfer function\" of the medium, while the FM information signal is recovered by conventional FM detection methods. The technique is considered most applicable to a two-directional tropospheric scatter link in which a low data-rate feedback channel is available to command changes in parameters of the transmitted signal, based on the analysis at the receiver of the instantaneous transfer function of the medium, to optimize channel transmission. Parameters of the transmitter which might be varied are power, deviation, data rate, carrier frequency, etc. (It is assumed that the bandwidth of the channel-sounding signal is considerably wider than the information modulation bandwidth.)","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1965.1089106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23684/01089106.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1965.1089106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23684","startPage":"162","endPage":"165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simultaneous Information Transfer and Channel-Sounding Modulation Technique for Wide-Band Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1089106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simultaneous Information Transfer and Channel-Sounding Modulation Technique for Wide-Band Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1965","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simultaneous Information Transfer and Channel-Sounding Modulation Technique for Wide-Band Channels","sourcePdf":"01089106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029485S","chronDate":"June  1965","isNumber":"23684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1089106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1089116,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Unlike cyclic codes that have a probability of undetected error bursts independent of the burst length and polynomial generator, the probability of undetected burst errors varies with the code generator and the burst length. However, it is conjectured that the fraction of undetected error bursts is of the same order as that for cyclic codes. This is proved for asymmetric channels.

The error probability of this system is given by a binomial distribution, the parameters of which are determined by the clutter and noise statistics. Explicit results are obtained for the case where the down-link noise may be neglected and the clutter is Gaussian. It is shown that the video clipper results in a degradation of performance of at most 2 dB relative to an ideal linear system and only about 1 dB relative to a system in which a limiting repeater is employed without clipping on the ground. For the case of strong clutter and strong noise, the degradation relative to an ideal linear system is shown to be 3 dB. The use of infinite clipping provides a two-fold advantage: 1) The error analysis can be performed at all signal-to-clutter and signal-to-noise ratios, not only in an asymptotic limit; 2) Digital signal processing of large time-bandwidth product signals is facilitated.

A minimal characterization is provided by the gross channel parameters of multipath spread and Doppler spread. This paper presents several techniques which will allow the simultaneous measurement of multipath and Doppler spread in real time with a minimum of equipment complexity. The techniques are first divided into two classes depending upon whether measurements are made on in-phase and quadrature components of received carriers or on envelopes of received carriers. A further subdivision is made according to two different techniques of multipath spread measurement, one of which, called the SSB method, uses two transmitted carriers while the other, called the FM method, uses a frequencymodulated carrier. The envelope measurements are the simplest and should provide considerable help in any large scale testing of the selective fading properties of the HF and troposcatter media.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"September  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  1965","publicationDate":"September 1965","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"13","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Some Techniques for the Instantaneous Real-Time Measurement of Multipath and Doppler Spread","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Techniques for the Instantaneous Real-Time Measurement of Multipath and Doppler Spread","sourcePdf":"01089133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061021S","chronDate":"September  1965","isNumber":"23685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"37","articleId":"1089133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1089134,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Careful attention to system design is necessary in an HF modem if its performance is not to be limited by selective fading effects. This paper determines the major error probability limitations caused by multipath and Doppler smear in the Kathryn modem, a new HF modem of considerable current interest. An analysis is also made of the effectiveness of two techniques for reducing these error probability limitations. Specifically, the effectiveness of time-guard bands in reducing the error probability caused by multipath smear and the effectiveness of delay compensation in reducing the decorrelation of the pilot tone caused by the combined effects of Doppler smear and a nonzero bandwidth pilot-tone filter are studied in detail. In addition, the error probability caused by synchronization error is evaluated.

The problem is formulated as a continuous estimation problem, where the desired output is a waveform that is the maximum a posteriori estimate of the transmitted message. The resulting structure is a nonrealizable, nonlinear system. We next find a demodulator structure that is realizable with delay, whose performance approximates the optimum system. Keeping the demodulator structure optimum, the transmitted signal is now optimized to obtain the best overall system. Two types of system constraints are considered. The demodulator is constrained to be above threshold, and the rms transmitted bandwidth is constrained. The modulator consists of a linear preemphasis network followed by a no-memory angle modulator. We find the linear network which causes the overall system to be optimum. Finally, we compare the optimum system to a phase modulation system using an optimum demodulator and properly chosen modulation index. For the class of message spectra, the difference is small.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1965.1089160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23686","startPage":"452","endPage":"469","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23686/01089160.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Angle Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1965","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimum Angle Modulation","publicationDate":"December 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Angle Modulation","sourcePdf":"01089160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039448S","chronDate":"December  1965","isNumber":"23686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1089160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1089161,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The system also automatically gives shorter acquisition times for improved signal-to-noise ratios. Experimental results are included which verify the analytical results.

This factor has deterred the use of SSB in some services in which it might be advantageous. There are two general ways to mitigate the stability problem: by transmitting a pilot carrier to synchronize a local oscillator, and by extracting the information signal from the envelope of the SSB signal. This paper deals with the second approach, i.e., SSB reception via envelope detection. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that distortionless reception is possible if a carrier component of a certain minimal strength is present, and if special circuitry is provided to process the SSB envelope. An interesting and possibly useful system based on these premises is described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1966","publicationDate":"February 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"14","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Demodulation of Single-Sideband Signals Via Envelope Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demodulation of Single-Sideband Signals Via Envelope Detection","sourcePdf":"01089285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041378S","chronDate":"February  1966","isNumber":"23693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"42","articleId":"1089285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1089288,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Thus, many people in all levels of engineering, management, government, and military occupations are being called upon to deliver judgments on this new mode of communications.

This paper has been compiled as a computational aid for designers and reviewers of communication systems employing earth satellites as relays. Pertinent design equations are introduced and discussed briefly, with special emphasis placed on the limitations of the equations and the ranges of the parameters. Many of the computational aids, such as charts and nomographs, that are applicable to the gross design of satellite communication systems are presented. The utility of these computational aids is demonstrated in the solutions of some simple satellite communication system design and analysis problems.

Expressions for calculating the distortion power or harmonic amplitudes, applicable to both single-tone and multitone message signals, are derived in terms of coefficients in the power series representation of channel phase characteristics. The quasi-stationary method is shown to be correct only in the leading term in each order of the distortion voltage. The missing terms can cause substantial errors in certain instances. Fluctuation in the channel amplitude function vs. frequency also causes change in the phase of the signal; the distortion generated is, however, one order of magnitude lower. Using a Butterworth-type bandpass filter as a particular example, the third and fifth harmonic amplitudes in the discriminator output are hand-calculated and plotted as a function of the modulation index. Results agree quite well with recent data from digital machine computations by Schenck and Kennedy.

Besides the assumed independence between the successive intervals between errors, they assume that the intervals have a Pareto distribution. Their graphical analyses of large amounts of data indicated departures from the model which Mandelbrot proposed in 1964 to account for in an extended model. Some simple formal statistical procedures are given for analyzing this sort of data, procedures that are not affected by the possibility that the population mean-interval-between-errors is infinite. The departures from independence of intervals noted by Berger and Mandelbrot are formally verified from the analysis of data from a single data transmission test. A separate analysis of another set of data is also made and the results are compared to see what features of the error patterns are general, and what features are particular to different transmission conditions. In both sets of data analyzed, the outstanding feature detected is the strong positive correlation between successive long intervals between errors. Evidence is also found which indicates that the upper tail of the marginal distribution of intervals between errors does not follow a hyperbolic law.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Analysis of Telephone Circuit Error Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1966.1089357","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23696/01089357.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1966.1089357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1089357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1966","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Analysis of Telephone Circuit Error Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1966","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Analysis of Telephone Circuit Error Data","sourcePdf":"01089357.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031624S","chronDate":"August  1966","isNumber":"23696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1089357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1089364,"authors":[{"name":"D.

However, the frequency scale f could be replaced by a freespace path loss LFS scale by noting that f = 0.1 Gc/s corresponds to LFS = 164.9 dB, f = 1.0 Gc/s corresponds to LFS = 154.9 dB, and 10 Gc/s corresponds to LFS = 204.9 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1966.1089390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23698/01089390.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1966.1089390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comments on \"Aids for the Gross Design of Satellite Communication Systems\"","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1089390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089390/","displayDocTitle":"Comments on \"Aids for the Gross Design of Satellite Communication Systems\"","volume":"14","issue":"6","publicationDate":"December 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comments on \"Aids for the Gross Design of Satellite Communication Systems\"","sourcePdf":"01089390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025476S","chronDate":"December  1966","isNumber":"23698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","articleId":"1089390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1089403,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Some of these technologies originate from requirements on the different types of systems to share the communications channel capacity of the orbital are in allocated spectral bands. Consideration of the technologies applied to different systems architectures leads to the conclusion that developing capabilities are converging on elimination of the distinction between point-to-point and broadcast services at 12 GHz.

Its unique modulation technique provides a wide range of signal redundancy and data rate to allow optimum performance over the correspondingly wide range of propagation conditions characteristic of HF radio. Efficient detection is achieved at all levels of redundancy by utilizing a fully coherent correlation detection technique. The detector is a continually self-adjusting matched filter to the timevarying ionospheric transfer function. The fine grain propagation data derived for detection allow continuous observation of parameters such as multipath delay and coherence time.

The signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed companded delta modulation method is almost equivalent to that of a conventional seven-bit compandored PCM.

The transmitting apparatus in such systems must therefore convert discrete symbols-often binary pulses-into prescribed analog waveforms. Current commercial systems do this via simple filtering, gating, and conventional modulation. These practices limit the types of waveforms that can be used and they are not always amenable to variable rate signaling. This paper describes a hybrid digital-analog method for approximating closely almost any reasonable digital signaling waveform. The basic idea is very simple: a \"staircase\" approximation of the desired signal can be generated via a shift-register version of a transversal filter. Variations on this idea, such as derivative approximation and multirate shifting, enhance its accuracy without destroying its simplicity and time-frequency scalability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal generators","Data communication","Filtering","Transversal filters","Communications technology","Error probability","Bandwidth","Low pass filters","Phase shift keying","Error analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23717/01089806.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of Digital Signaling Waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1089806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generation of Digital Signaling Waveforms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089806/","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of Digital Signaling Waveforms","sourcePdf":"01089806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035087S","chronDate":"February  1968","isNumber":"23717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1089806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1089811,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Such a system, called an integrated telephone network, requires synchronization of incoming signals arriving at each exchange to the local timing pulse generator controlling a time division switch of the exchange. In the synchronization method described in this paper-the equational timing system a local oscillator of controllable frequency that drives the local timing pulse generator in each exchange is controlled by making reference to the phase differences between incoming signals arriving at the exchange from the other exchanges and incoming signals arriving at the other exchanges from the exchange. This synchronization method permits the minimun storage capacity of the buffer memory indispensable for compensation of the junction-delay variation, indefinite enlargement of the network and multiplication of its complexity, and invulnerability to the consequence of failure of one or more junctions or timing pulse generators in the network. The phase differences between the local timing pulse generators of exchanges in the network, the stability of the network applied with this synchronization method, and an example of the equational timing system are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23717/01089819.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1089819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of a PCM Integrated Telephone Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"February  1968","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of a PCM Integrated Telephone Network","volume":"16","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of a PCM Integrated Telephone Network","sourcePdf":"01089819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038153S","chronDate":"February  1968","isNumber":"23717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1089819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1089824,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is, however, preferable to have a channel model upon which various error control techniques can be tried out as opposed to the direct approach, which is available only to the possessor of the data. This paper has been developed with the intention of presenting both the traditional channel modeling statistics (consecutive error distributions and gap distributions) and a set of new statistics against which modeling can be performed, The error statistics incurred in the transmission of high-frequency digital data at rates of from 600 to 2400 bit/s over various paths of the Eastern Test Range are presented herein. The data was transmitted on and parallel to the range using various modulation systems (modems). It is demonstrated that the errors occur in nonrandom fashion and in some cases are periodic. These error patterns (especially the periodic ones) present a new important problem for channel modeling of HF data From a heavily-used transequatorial circuit. While the basic approach is not new, the characteristics of the data are different from those previously reported and imply that channel performance is relatively independent of modulation technique. The error statistics presented herein should assist those, not having direct access to the data, who are interested in the problem of modeling this data which does not fit any known model (e.g. Gilbert, Berkovits, and Pareto[2]-[4]). Until such a model is available, this author will continue to report on error control performance using the direct simulation approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089839/","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error Patterns Measured On Transequatorial HF Communication Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Patterns Measured On Transequatorial HF Communication Links","sourcePdf":"01089839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023302S","chronDate":"April  1968","isNumber":"23718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1089839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1089840,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Cyclic product codes may be synthesized in the form of interlaced codes if the block lengths of the codes are relatively prime. In this case, the decoder can be synthesized in the form of a cascade of decoders, each of which operates on one of the subcodes forming the product code. The cascade decoders described differ from most of the decoders given in the coding literature in two major respects. First, they can be built. Second, instead of correcting all error patterns with weight less than some fixed value and no error patterns of greater weight, cascade decoders correct many error patterns beyond their guaranteed correction capability.

The factors considered jointly are sampling time error, carrier phase offset, and nonideal phase characteristics of transmitting and receiving filters. Performance is measured by the familiar criterion of eye opening of the received data signal. A closed-form expression for the eye opening is obtained. It is shown that the lengthy nonlinear functions in the solution can be closely approximated by simple piecewise linear functions for parameter values of interest. The optimum settings of the sampling time and the carrier phase are determined for given filter phase distortion. Also, considering all factors, simple formulas are developed for computing interchannel interferences, intersymbol interference, and the resulting eye opening. Simple relationships between the eye opening and filter phase distortion are explored, and a concept of parametric eye is introduced to aid in filter design. An illustrative example is considered which shows that the impairment of the system performance is not excessive for a reasonable range of system design parameters.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","startPage":"529","endPage":"540","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089889","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23720/01089889.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theoretical Study of Performance of an Orthogonal Multiplexing Data Transmission Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"August  1968","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Study of Performance of an Orthogonal Multiplexing Data Transmission Scheme","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","publicationDate":"August 1968","volume":"16","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Study of Performance of an Orthogonal Multiplexing Data Transmission Scheme","sourcePdf":"01089889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028251S","chronDate":"August  1968","isNumber":"23720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"189","articleId":"1089889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1089894,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Also, when the results for the three cases are suitably compared, it is found that the error probabilities are more sensitive to the shape of the signaling pulse than to the shape of the channel frequency correlation function.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23721/01089904.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1089904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further Results Concerning the Effect of Frequency-Selective Fading on Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Fading","Matched filters","Diversity reception","Error probability","Nonlinear filters","Shape","Communications technology","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Pulse shaping methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1968","displayDocTitle":"Further Results Concerning the Effect of Frequency-Selective Fading on Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Receivers","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further Results Concerning the Effect of Frequency-Selective Fading on Differentially Coherent Matched Filter Receivers","sourcePdf":"01089904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023306S","chronDate":"October  1968","isNumber":"23721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1089904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1089908,"authors":[{"name":"Leang Yeh","affiliation":["Page Communications Engineers, Inc., Washington"],"lastName":"Leang Yeh","id":"37087931917"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9332"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2175"}],"articleNumber":"1089908","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite communication","Telephony","Satellite broadcasting","Artificial satellites","Satellite ground stations","Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio","Circuits","Phase change materials","Pulse modulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1089908","abstract":"This paper concerns two important aspects of a multiple-access tradeoff study for an intra-South American satellite communication system: 1) the radio-frequency transmitter power in both the satellite and the earth stations (particularly the former which is at a preminm) needing to give acceptable telephone channel signal-to-noise ratio performance; 2) the bandwidth requirements in both the satellite and the earth stations in relation to the traffic capacity to be accommodated, i.e., the comparative economy in the use of the radio-frequency spectrum.","doi":"10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1968.1089908","startPage":"721","endPage":"730","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4547467/23721/01089908.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=23721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Access Tradeoff Study for Intra-South American Satellite Communication System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1968","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Access Tradeoff Study for Intra-South American Satellite Communication System","publicationDate":"October 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089908/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Access Tradeoff Study for Intra-South American Satellite Communication System","sourcePdf":"01089908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021648S","chronDate":"October  1968","isNumber":"23721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","articleId":"1089908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1089909,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The analysis is of practical interest since intermodulation distortion is often a limiting consideration in the design of solid-state long-haul broad-band frequency-division multiplexed transmission systems, and since speech on such systems is best represented by zero mean Gaussian noise. The analysis technique is amenable to digital computer calculation; as such, quantitive results are readily obtained. The analysis was applied to a single-stage transistor amplifier that was represented by a frequency-dependent nonlinear model. An excellent agreement between measured and calculated results was obtained. Portions of the program written for this example are readily applicable to the calculation of intermodulation distortion for any thirdorder nonlinear system (e.g., amplifier, repeater, or cascade of repeaters and cable sections) given the appropriate Volterra kernels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1089909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 1968","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2003","displayDocTitle":"Noise Loading Analysis of a Third-Order Nonlinear System with Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Loading Analysis of a Third-Order Nonlinear System with Memory","sourcePdf":"01089909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061428S","chronDate":"October  1968","isNumber":"23721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547467","citationCount":"28","articleId":"1089909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1089918,"authors":[{"name":"K.
