We propose a novel approach for the selection of segments to be included in a video summary based on hidden Markov models (HMM), which are trained on an annotated subset of the content. The observations of the HMM are relevance judgments of content segments based on different visual features, the hidden states are the selection/non-selection of content segments. The HMM is designed to take all relevant scenes into account. We show that the approach generalizes well when trained on sufficiently diverse content.","doi":"10.1109/WIAMIS.2009.5031430","publicationTitle":"2009 10th Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939248/5031414/05031430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIAMIS.2009.5031430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5031414","startPage":"53","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Summarizing raw video material using Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5031430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Summarizing raw video material using Hidden Markov Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5031430/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10689141","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5031430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Summarizing raw video material using Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"013_paper_205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088545S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939248","isNumber":"5031414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939248","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5031414","articleId":"5031430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5031440,"authors":[{"name":"Nikos Deligiannis","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Interdisciplinary Institute of Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Deligiannis","id":"37313553300"},{"name":"Adrian Munteanu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Interdisciplinary Institute of Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Munteanu","id":"37273656100"},{"name":"Tom Clerckx","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Interdisciplinary Institute of Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Clerckx","id":"37313551900"},{"name":"Jan Cornelis","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Interdisciplinary Institute of Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Cornelis","id":"37273649200"},{"name":"Peter Schelkens","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Interdisciplinary Institute of Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Schelkens","id":"37273637200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3609-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3610-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5873"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5881"}],"articleNumber":"5031440","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation channel estimation in pixel-domain distributed video coding","abstract":"The paper addresses an essential problem in distributed video coding (DVC) which is modeling and estimation of the correlation channel. Current works assume the distribution of the correlation noise to be independent from the realization of the side-information. The paper demonstrates that this assumption is inaccurate and proposes a novel model which depends on the realization of the side-information. The proposed model is experimentally validated showing remarkable accuracy over conventional models. Driven by the side-information-dependency of the proposed model, a novel technique for estimating the correlation channel in video at the decoder is introduced.

This project seeks to improve elevator call time responsiveness by utilizing the concept that traffic flows generally form definable patterns that can be used to predict future traffic flow behaviors. A feed-forward neural network-based control algorithm has been developed that can approximate elevator call patterns by learning to associate time of day with specific call locations. This algorithm was tested against fuzzy patterns of elevator calls in which the randomly generated calls were biased towards certain floors at certain times of day. When the average neural network controlled call times of 10 such fuzzy sets were compared to the typical scenario of the elevator returning to the first floor after each call, a 42% improvement in elevator call time responsiveness was observed. It is thereby suggested that a machine learning enabled-elevator control system could result in increased user satisfaction by reducing wait times by helping to ensure that the elevator is at the most likely place the elevator will be called from prior to an individual even pushing the call button. The utility of such an algorithm is likely further enhanced, however, by the fact that having the elevator in the most likely call location can also lead to significant energy savings in that the elevator will need to travel less to pick up prospective passengers.","doi":"10.1109/LISAT.2009.5031561","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LISAT.2009.5031561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5031554","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4957848/5031554/05031561.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving elevator call time responsiveness via an artificial neural network control mechanism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5031561/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving elevator call time responsiveness via an artificial neural network control mechanism","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5031561/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10698213","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"1-1 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-1 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving elevator call time responsiveness via an artificial neural network control mechanism","confLoc":"Farmingdale, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"Man_Echavarria_PID880296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034388S","chronDate":"1-1 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957848","isNumber":"5031554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957848","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5031554","articleId":"5031561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5031567,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Mesecher","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, Bethpage, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4957848/5031554/5031567/5031567-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David K.

This process exploits knowledge of the finite bandwidth of the signal. Alternatively, if the signal's Fourier spectrum were available, the signal could be sampled in the Fourier domain, and if it were known that some of the Fourier coefficients were negligible, the number of samples required to capture all of the signal's information could be reduced. If it were known that the signal had such a property - called sparseness - in the Fourier domain, would it be possible instead to sample the signal at a reduced rate in its native form while still capturing the signal's information? Moreover, would it be possible to do so without knowing exactly which Fourier coefficients were negligible? In this paper we examine a recently introduced approach called compressive sampling (CS) which attempts to go beyond the exploitation of a signal's finite bandwidth, and exploit signal sparseness to allow signals to be ldquounder sampledrdquo without losing information. We will develop the concept of CS based on signal sparseness and provide a justification for the compressive-sampling process, including an explanation for the need for randomness in the process, and subsequent signal reconstruction from the CS samples. In addition, examples of applications of CS will be provided, along with simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5031567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-1 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-1 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5031567/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10698219","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting signal sparseness for reduced-rate sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting signal sparseness for reduced-rate sampling","confLoc":"Farmingdale, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"Man_Mesecher_PID880286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04668S","chronDate":"1-1 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957848","isNumber":"5031554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957848","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5031554","articleId":"5031567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5031727,"authors":[{"name":"Susanna Orlic","affiliation":["Optical Technologies Laboratory, Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Susanna","lastName":"Orlic","id":"37284497900"},{"name":"Enrico Dietz","affiliation":["Optical Technologies Laboratory, Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Dietz","id":"37284498800"},{"name":"Timo Feid","affiliation":["Optical Technologies Laboratory, Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Feid","id":"37321556600"},{"name":"Sven Frohmann","affiliation":["Optical Technologies Laboratory, Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Frohmann","id":"37284495600"},{"name":"Henning Markoetter","affiliation":["Optical Technologies Laboratory, Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Markoetter","id":"37321556100"},{"name":"Jens Rass","affiliation":["Optical Technologies Laboratory, Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Rass","id":"37321895800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3342-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3343-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5031727","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"Research activities and development paths toward a fully functional optical drive system based on the microholographic storage approach are presented.

Recent progress in dynamic multilayer recording of resolution limited microholographic lines is reported. We discuss the target specification and related conception of a microholographic storage system. Advanced system solutions allow for compensating the spherical aberration and limited diode laser coherence in a compact microholographic drive.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4957850/5031724/05031727.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2009 Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting","doi":"10.1109/ODS.2009.5031727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ODS.2009.5031727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5031724","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5031727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volumetric optical storage with microholograms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical recording","Holography","Holographic optical components","Optical filters","Optical signal processing","Nonhomogeneous media","Disk recording","Optical materials","High definition video","Optical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aberrations","holographic storage","light diffraction","micro-optics","optical disc storage","optical multilayers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volumetric optical storage","functional optical drive system","compact microholographic storage drive","write-read system","single-beam diffraction","subwavelength-sized reflection hologram generation","media tester","dynamic multilayer recording","spherical aberration compensation","diode laser coherence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Volume holography","Microholograms","Photopolymers","Multiplexing","Multilayer recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5031727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Volumetric optical storage with microholograms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5031727/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10698235","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volumetric optical storage with microholograms","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"MA1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025041S","chronDate":"10-13 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957850","isNumber":"5031724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957850","xplore-issue":"5031724","articleId":"5031727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5031745,"authors":[{"name":"Kimihiro Saito","affiliation":["Advanced Storage Laboratory, Advanced Materials Laboratories, Sony Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kimihiro","lastName":"Saito","id":"37305275700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3342-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3343-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5031745","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"abstract":"In micro-reflector optical disc systems, multi-layer index modulation distribution causes wavefront fluctuation in the light beam passing through the recorded layers.

High-speed mode provides similar power and performance to traditional FPGA routing switches. In low-power mode, speed is curtailed in order to reduce power consumption. Leakage is reduced by 28%-52% in low-power versus high-speed mode, depending on the particular switch design selected. Dynamic power is reduced by 28%-31% in low-power mode. Leakage power in sleep mode, which is suitable for unused routing switches, is 61%-79% lower than in high-speed mode. Each of the proposed switch designs has a different power/area/speed tradeoff. All of the designs require only minor changes to a traditional routing switch and involve relatively small area overhead, making them easy to incorporate into current commercial FPGAs. The applicability of the new switches is motivated through an analysis of timing slack in industrial FPGA designs. It is observed that a considerable fraction of routing switches may be slowed down (operate in low-power mode), without impacting overall design performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2017443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5170177/05031895.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2017443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5031895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power Programmable FPGA Routing Circuitry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5031895/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Programmable FPGA Routing Circuitry","volume":"17","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5031895/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10793037","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power Programmable FPGA Routing Circuitry","sourcePdf":"17tvlsi05-janderson-2017443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084217S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5170177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5170177","articleId":"5031895","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5031896,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Yin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5419135/5031896/5031896-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei-Yin Chen received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1986, and 1999, respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Penn Sate University, University Park, in 1990.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University.

Focusing on symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms, the proposed analysis provides a deeper insight into the vulnerability of cryptographic circuits. The main parameters that are of interest in practical DPA attacks are derived under suitable approximations, and a new figure of merit to measure the DPA effectiveness is proposed. Worst case conditions under which a cryptographic circuit should be tested to evaluate its robustness against DPA attacks are identified and analyzed. Several interesting properties of DPA attacks are also derived from the proposed model, whose fundamental expressions are compared with the counterparts of correlation power analysis attacks. The model was validated by means of DPA attacks on an FPGA implementation of the advanced encryption standard algorithm. Experimental results show that the model has a good accuracy, as its error is always lower than 2%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5453312/05031897.pdf","startPage":"711","endPage":"724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5453312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Power Model of Differential Power Analysis Attacks to Static Logic Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5031897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"A General Power Model of Differential Power Analysis Attacks to Static Logic Circuits","volume":"18","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11260223","htmlLink":"/document/5031897/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Power Model of Differential Power Analysis Attacks to Static Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-alioto-2015327.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098796S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5453312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5453312","articleId":"5031897","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5031899,"authors":[{"name":"Wenping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5393244/5031899/5031899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenping Wang (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, in 2008.","She worked as a research assistant at Peking University, Beijing, China, from 2001 to 2003.

In this paper, we develop a hierarchical framework for analyzing the impact of NBTI on the performance of logic circuits under various operation conditions, such as the supply voltage, temperature, and node switching activity. Given a circuit topology and input switching activity, we propose an efficient method to predict the degradation of circuit speed over a long period of time. The effectiveness of our method is comprehensively demonstrated with the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) benchmarks and a 65-nm industrial design. Furthermore, we extract the following key design insights for reliable circuit design under NBTI effect, including: 1) During dynamic operation, NBTI-induced degradation is relatively insensitive to supply voltage, but strongly dependent on temperature; 2) There is an optimum supply voltage that leads to the minimum of circuit performance degradation; circuit degradation rate actually goes up if supply voltage is lower than the optimum value; 3) Circuit performance degradation due to NBTI is highly sensitive to input vectors. The difference in delay degradation is up to 5\u00d7 for various static and dynamic operations. Finally, we examine the interaction between NBTI effect, and process and design uncertainty in realistic conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2008810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5393244/05031899.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2008810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of NBTI Effect on Combinational Circuit: Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5031899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of NBTI Effect on Combinational Circuit: Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5031899/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11071372","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5031899/","volume":"18","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of NBTI Effect on Combinational Circuit: Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wang-2008810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132517S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5393244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"5393244","articleId":"5031899","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5031904,"authors":[{"name":"Ruzica Jevtic","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenieria Electr\u00f3nica, ETSI Telecomunicacion, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ruzica","lastName":"Jevtic","id":"37321524600"},{"name":"Carlos Carreras","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenieria Electr\u00f3nica, ETSI Telecomunicacion, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Carreras","id":"37265727600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5031904","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1173},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Energy consumption","Power measurement","Table lookup","Routing","Fabrics","Application specific integrated circuits","Design optimization","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded multiplier blocks","FPGA","DSP application","field-programmable gate arrays","dynamic power estimation","embedded multipliers","Xilinx Virtex-II Pro chips","lookup table","high-level power optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded multipliers","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","power estimation"]}],"abstract":"The use of embedded multiplier blocks has become a norm in DSP applications due to their high performance and low power consumption.

We present a dynamic power estimation methodology for the embedded multipliers in Xilinx Virtex-II Pro chips. The methodology is an adaptation of an existing power estimation method for lookup-table-based components and uses information about the type of architecture of the embedded block. The power model is characterized and verified by on-board measurements and is ready for integration with high-level power optimization techniques.

As a consequence, much time and resources are required for training microinjection personnel. This situation has been aggravated by the rapid growth of genetic research, which has increased the demand for mutant animals. Therefore, increased productivity and efficiency in this area are highly desired. Here, we pursue these goals through the automation of a previously developed teleoperated blastocyst microinjection system. This included the design of a new system setup to facilitate automation, the definition of rules for automatic microinjections, the implementation of video processing algorithms to extract feedback information from microscope images, and the creation of control algorithms for process automation. Experimentation conducted with this new system and operator assistance during the cells delivery phase demonstrated a 75% microinjection success rate. In addition, implantation of the successfully injected blastocysts resulted in a 53% birth rate and a 20% yield of chimeras. These results proved that the developed system was capable of automatic blastocyst penetration and retraction, demonstrating the success of major steps toward full process automation.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5230355/05032128.pdf","startPage":"822","endPage":"831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in

modifications to the learning algorithm of the self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) to improve computational efficiency. It is shown that the modified SOFNN favorably compares to other evolving fuzzy systems in terms of accuracy and structural complexity. An analysis of the SOFNN's effectiveness when applied in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) involving the neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP) framework is also presented, where a sensitivity analysis (SA) of the SOFNN hyperparameters was performed using EEG data recorded from three subjects during left/right-motor-imagery-based BCI experiments. The aim of this one-time SA was to eliminate the need to choose subject- and signal-specific hyperparameters for the SOFNN and thus apply the SOFNN in the NTSPP framework as a parameterless self-organizing framework for EEG preprocessing. The results indicate that a general set of NTSPP parameters chosen via the SA provide the best results when tested in a BCI system. Therefore, with this general set of SOFNN parameters and its self-organizing structure, in conjunction with parameterless feature extraction and linear discriminant classification, a fully parameterless BCI that lends itself well to autonomous adaptation is realizable.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2018469","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5238715/05032132.pdf","startPage":"1458","endPage":"1471","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2018469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network Training and a Hyperparameter Analysis for a Brain\u2013Computer Interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5032132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Faster Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network Training and a Hyperparameter Analysis for a Brain\u2013Computer Interface","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10879841","pubMedId":"19493851","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network Training and a Hyperparameter Analysis for a Brain\u2013Computer Interface","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-coyle-2018469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064013S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","isNumber":"5238715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"65","articleId":"5032132","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5032133,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37310081700"},{"name":"Jennie Si","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jennie","lastName":"Si","id":"37308391800"},{"name":"Konstantinos S.

Genetic algorithms (GAs)-search procedures inspired by the mechanics of natural selection and genetics-have been increasingly applied across the spectrum of human endeavor, but some researchers mistakenly think of them as slow, unreliable, and without much theoretical support. This talk briefly introduces GAs, but quickly shifts to a line of work that has succeeded in supporting GA mechanics with bounding design theory that has been used to demonstrate GA scalability, speed, and range of reliable applicability. Key elements of this theory are discussed to give insight into this accomplishment and to make the point that fast, scalable GAs may also be viewed as first-order models of human innovative or inventive processes. The talk highlights recent results in breaking the billion- variable optimization barrier for the first time, and points to a variety of opportunities for efficiency enhancement that should be useful in the application of genetic algorithms to a variety of software engineering problems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSBSE.2009.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5033159","startPage":"xx","endPage":"xx","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5033158/5033159/05033171.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Not your grandmother's genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5033171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5033171/","displayDocTitle":"Not your grandmother's genetic algorithm","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690097","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Not your grandmother's genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Windsor, UK","sourcePdf":"3675z020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032326S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5033158","isNumber":"5033159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5033158","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5033159","articleId":"5033171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5033551,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Kobayashi","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Takayuki Kobayashi (S'05\u2013M'06) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in communications engineering from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.","Since April 2006, he has been with NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT, Yokosuka, Japan.

Simulators use predictive tracking to compensate for display lag, preparing display updates based on the anticipated head motion. This paper proposes a new method for predicting head orientation using a delta quaternion (DQ)-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) and compares the performance to a quaternion EKF. The proposed framework operates on the change in quaternion between consecutive data frames (the DQ), which avoids the heavy computational burden of the quaternion motion equation. Head velocity is estimated from the DQ by an EKF and then used to predict future head orientation. We have tested the new framework with captured head motion data and compared it with the computationally expensive quaternion filter. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DQ method provides the accuracy of the quaternion method without the heavy computational burden.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5033784/","volume":"39","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5033784/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10879842","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"19493852","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Head Orientation Prediction: Delta Quaternions Versus Quaternions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Head Orientation Prediction: Delta Quaternions Versus Quaternions","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-motai-2016571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069477S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5238715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5238715","articleId":"5033784","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5035620,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel van der Heijden","affiliation":["University of Maastricht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"van der Heijden","id":"37321658800"},{"name":"Sander Bakkes","affiliation":["Tilburg centre for Creative Computing TiCC, Tilburg University, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sander","lastName":"Bakkes","id":"37303076900"},{"name":"Pieter Spronck","affiliation":["Tilburg centre for Creative Computing TiCC, Tilburg University, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Pieter","lastName":"Spronck","id":"37303075700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2973-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2974-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"5035620","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic formations in real-time strategy games","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5035620","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Artificial intelligence","Testing","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time strategy games","video games","static formations","ORTS"]}],"abstract":"Current approaches to organising units in strategic video games are typically implemented via static formations. Static formations are not capable of adapting effectively to opponent tactics. In this paper we discuss an approach to organising units by learning the effectiveness of a formation in actual play, and directly applying learned formations according to the classification of the opponent player. This approach to establish so-called dynamic formations, is tested in the ORTS game environment. From our results, we may conclude that the approach to established dynamic formations can be successfully applied in actual video-game environments.","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2008.5035620","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4967991/5035601/05035620.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2008.5035620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic formations in real-time strategy games","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5035620/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10689084","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5035620/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic formations in real-time strategy games","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper-07-8054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056518S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4967991","isNumber":"5035601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4967991","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5035601","articleId":"5035620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5035623,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Danielsiek","affiliation":["Algorithm Engineering, Computational, Intelligence Group, Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Danielsiek","id":"37303089700"},{"name":"Raphael Stuer","affiliation":["Algorithm Engineering, Computational, Intelligence Group, Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Stuer","id":"37303089900"},{"name":"Andreas Thom","affiliation":["Algorithm Engineering, Computational, Intelligence Group, Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Thom","id":"37303090200"},{"name":"Nicola Beume","affiliation":["Algorithm Engineering, Computational, Intelligence Group, Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Beume","id":"37303075500"},{"name":"Boris Naujoks","affiliation":["Algorithm Engineering, Computational, Intelligence Group, Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Naujoks","id":"37303080100"},{"name":"Mike Preuss","affiliation":["Algorithm Engineering, Computational, Intelligence Group, Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Preuss","id":"37297107500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2973-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2974-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"5035623","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5035623","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Humans","Assembly","Self organizing feature maps","Evolutionary computation","Computational intelligence","Computer science","Filters","Artificial neural networks","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","game theory","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time strategy games","path-finding","open source game","flocking fails","influence maps","RTS games"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035601","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2008.5035623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent moving of groups in real-time strategy games","startPage":"71","endPage":"78","pdfPath":"/iel5/4967991/5035601/05035623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2008.5035623","abstract":"This paper investigates the intelligent moving and path-finding of groups in real-time strategy (RTS) games exemplified by the open source game Glest.

Furthermore, we present a setting in which flocking will improve the game progress. But we also demonstrate a situation where flocking fails. To prevent these annoying situations, we combined flocking with influence maps (IM) to find safe paths for the flock in real time. This combination turns out to be an excellent alternative to normal movement in Glest and most likely in other RTS games.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5035623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5035623/","accessionNumber":"10689087","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent moving of groups in real-time strategy games","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent moving of groups in real-time strategy games","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper-10-8075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048312S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4967991","isNumber":"5035601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4967991","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5035601","articleId":"5035623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5035629,"authors":[{"name":"Julian Togelius","affiliation":["IDSIA, Manno Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Togelius","id":"38483272100"},{"name":"Jurgen Schmidhuber","affiliation":["Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Schmidhuber","id":"37304241400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2973-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2974-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"5035629","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":931},"abstract":"This paper presents a first attempt at evolving the rules for a game.

However the notion of scaling up behaviour into something more noteworthy and complex is far from elementary. In this paper we propose a method of combining neuroevolution practices with the subsumption paradigm; in which we generate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) layers ordered in a hierarchy such that high-level controllers can override lower behaviours. To explore this proposal we apply our controllers to the dasiaEvoTankspsila domain; a small, dynamic, adversarial environment. Our results show that once layers are evolved we can generate competent and capable results that can deal with hierarchies of multiple layers. Further analysis of results provides interesting insights into design decisions for such controllers, particularly when compared to the original suggestions for the subsumption paradigm.","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2008.5035635","startPage":"159","endPage":"166","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2008.5035635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035601","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4967991/5035601/05035635.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling-up behaviours in EvoTanks: Applying subsumption principles to artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5035635/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Scaling-up behaviours in EvoTanks: Applying subsumption principles to artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5035635/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10689097","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling-up behaviours in EvoTanks: Applying subsumption principles to artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper-21-8026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055727S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4967991","isNumber":"5035601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4967991","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5035601","articleId":"5035635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5035636,"authors":[{"name":"John Reeder","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Reeder","id":"37303228200"},{"name":"Roberto Miguez","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Miguez","id":"37303227800"},{"name":"Jessica Sparks","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Sparks","id":"37317912400"},{"name":"Michael Georgiopoulos","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Georgiopoulos","id":"37271315600"},{"name":"Georgios Anagnostopoulos","affiliation":["Florida Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Anagnostopoulos","id":"37296633100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2973-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2974-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"5035636","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5035636","abstract":"As the realism in games continues to increase, through improvements in graphics and 3D engines, more focus is placed on the behavior of the simulated agents that inhabit the simulated worlds. The agents in modern video games must become more life-like in order to seem to belong in the environments they are portrayed in. Many modern artificial intelligence approaches achieve a high level of realism but this is accomplished through significant developer time spent scripting the behaviors of the non-playable characters or NPC's. These agents will behave in a believable fashion in the scenarios they have been programmed for, but do not have the ability to adapt to new situations. In this paper we introduce a modularized, real-time evolution training technique to evolve adaptable agents with life-like behaviors. Online performance during evolution is also improved by using selection mechanisms found in temporal difference learning methods to appropriately balance the exploration and exploitation of control policies. These methods are implemented and tested using the XNA framework producing very promising results regarding efficiency of techniques, and demonstrating many potential avenues for further research.","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2008.5035636","startPage":"167","endPage":"174","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4967991/5035601/05035636.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2008.5035636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactively evolved modular neural networks for game agent control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Games","Robots","Machine learning","Marine vehicles","Evolutionary computation","Humans","Sparks","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","neural nets","software agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactively evolved modular neural networks","game agent control","simulated agents","video games","nonplayable characters","temporal difference learning methods","XNA framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5035636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Interactively evolved modular neural networks for game agent control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5035636/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10689098","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactively evolved modular neural networks for game agent control","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper-22-8063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054305S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4967991","isNumber":"5035601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4967991","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5035601","articleId":"5035636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5035638,"authors":[{"name":"Kazutomo Shibahara","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture\uc2a0and\uc2a0Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazutomo","lastName":"Shibahara","id":"37303258800"},{"name":"Yoshiyuki Kotani","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture\uc2a0and\uc2a0Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiyuki","lastName":"Kotani","id":"37317547900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2973-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2974-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"5035638","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Gold","Silver","Medals","Imaging phantoms","Testing","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["winning percentage","sigmoid function","Monte-Carlo simulations","Go","BlokusDuo","random simulations"]}],"abstract":"Monte-Carlo method recently has produced good results in Go. Monte-Carlo Go uses a move which has the highest mean value of either winning percentage or final score. In a past research, winning percentage is superior to final score in Monte-Carlo Go. We investigated them in BlokusDuo, which is a relatively new game, and showed that Monte-Carlo using final score is superior to the one that uses winning percentage in cases where many random simulations are used. Besides, we showed that using final score is unfavorable for UCT, which is the most famous algorithm in Monte-Carlo Go. To introduce the effectivity of final score to UCT, we suggested a way to combine winning percentage and final score by using sigmoid function. We show the effectivity of the suggested method and show that the method improves a bias where Monte-Carlo Go plays very safe moves when it has advantage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining final score with winning percentage by sigmoid function in Monte-Carlo simulations","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2008.5035638","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence and Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4967991/5035601/05035638.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2008.5035638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5035601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5035638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5035638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Combining final score with winning percentage by sigmoid function in Monte-Carlo simulations","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5035638/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10689100","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining final score with winning percentage by sigmoid function in Monte-Carlo simulations","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"Paper-24-8016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066553S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4967991","isNumber":"5035601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4967991","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5035601","articleId":"5035638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5035639,"authors":[{"name":"Shogo Takeuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shogo","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37307681200"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Kaneko","affiliation":["Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37305834200"},{"name":"Kazunori Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37267252900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2973-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2974-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"5035639","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Search methods","Sampling methods","Application software","Databases","Computational modeling","Functional programming","Game theory","Visualization","Art"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","Monte Carlo methods","probability","search problems","tree searching","very large databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo tree search","computer game programming","large database","probability","search method"]}],"abstract":"Recent improvements to Monte Carlo tree search have produced strong computer Go programs.

Device A has the largest Zn-diffusion depth (~1.3 mum) and can sustain single-mode operations under a whole range of bias currents, exhibiting the largest differential quantum efficiency and smallest far-field divergence angle. Devices B and C have smaller Zn-diffusion depths (0.5 mum for device B and 0 mum for device C) and exhibit poorer multimode performance. However, due to the serious spatial hole burning effect of device A, induced by its single-spot and high-power output, the measured electrical-to-optical (EO) frequency response of device A shows a more serious (>3 dB) low-frequency (<2 GHz) rolloff than does that of the other two devices. Although device B (with a shallow Zn-diffusion depth) shows multimode performance, with it we can minimize the low-frequency roll-off problem, due to its more uniform photon density distribution and less spatial-hole burning effect than that of device A. Using device B, we can achieve an 11-GHz 3-dB bandwidth, the highest modulation current efficiency ( ~ 8 GHz/mA\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sup>\n), and clear eye-opening at 10 Gb/s operation, with the lowest dc and radio frequency power consumption among the three devices.

The applications targeted include peer-to-peer networks for web surfing, coordinated braking, runway incursion prevention, adaptive traffic control, vehicle formations, and many others. The diversity of the applications and their potential communication protocols has challenged a systematic literature survey. We apply a classification technique to IVC applications to provide a taxonomy for detailed study of their communication requirements. The applications are divided into type classes which share common communication organization and performance requirements. IVC protocols are surveyed separately and their fundamental characteristics are revealed. The protocol characteristics are then used to determine the relevance of specific protocols to specific types of IVC applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5039580/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2009","volume":"11","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10712892","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5039580/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A survey of inter-vehicle communication protocols and their applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of inter-vehicle communication protocols and their applications","sourcePdf":"2willke.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117787S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5039578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"312","xplore-issue":"5039578","articleId":"5039580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5039581,"authors":[{"name":"Ruhai Wang","affiliation":["Drayer Department of Electrical Engineering, Lamar University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ruhai Wang [M'03] (wang@ee.lamar.edu) received a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from New Mexico State University, USA, in 2001.

Then we give a holistic overview of security issues. These issues are divided into seven categories: cryptography, key management, attack detections and preventions, secure routing, secure location security, secure data fusion, and other security issues. Along the way we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of current secure schemes in each category.

This is illustrated with the aid of a customer-provider model from the field of economics.

Multiple antennas can be utilized in order to accomplish a multiplexing gain, a diversity gain, or an antenna gain, thus enhancing the bit rate, the error performance, or the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio of wireless systems, respectively. With an enormous amount of yearly publications, the field of multiple-antenna systems, often called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, has evolved rapidly. To date, there are numerous papers on the performance limits of MIMO systems, and an abundance of transmitter and receiver concepts has been proposed. The objective of this literature survey is to provide non-specialists working in the general area of digital communications with a comprehensive overview of this exciting research field. To this end, the last ten years of research efforts are recapitulated, with focus on spatial multiplexing and spatial diversity techniques. In particular, topics such as transmitter and receiver structures, channel coding, MIMO techniques for frequency-selective fading channels, diversity reception and space-time coding techniques, differential and non-coherent schemes, beamforming techniques and closed-loop MIMO techniques, cooperative diversity schemes, as well as practical aspects influencing the performance of multiple-antenna systems are addressed. Although the list of references is certainly not intended to be exhaustive, the publications cited will serve as a good starting point for further reading.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2009.090207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5039578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2009.090207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5039578/05039585.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-antenna techniques for wireless communications - a comprehensive literature survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-antenna techniques for wireless communications - a comprehensive literature survey","volume":"11","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5039585/","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2009","accessionNumber":"10712897","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5039585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-antenna techniques for wireless communications - a comprehensive literature survey","sourcePdf":"7mietzner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.226858S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5039578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"317","xplore-issue":"5039578","articleId":"5039585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"}]
