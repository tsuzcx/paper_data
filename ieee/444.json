First, resultant theory is applied to transcendental equations to eliminate low-order harmonics and to determine switching angles for a fundamental frequency-switching scheme. Next, based on the number of harmonics to be eliminated, Newton climbing method is applied to transcendental equations to eliminate high-order harmonics and to determine switching angles for the fundamental frequency-switching scheme. Third, the magnitudes and phases of the residual lower order harmonics are computed, generated, and subtracted from the original voltage waveform to eliminate these low-order harmonics. Compared to the active-harmonic-elimination method (AHEM), which generates square waves to cancel high-order harmonics, RAHEM has lower switching frequency. The simulation results show that the method can effectively eliminate all the specific harmonics, and a low total harmonic distortion (THD) near sine wave is produced. An experimental 11-level H-bridge multilevel converter with a field-programmable gate-array controller is employed to experimentally validate the method. The experimental results show that RAHEM does effectively eliminate any number of specific harmonics, and the output voltage waveform has low switching frequency and low THD.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04441337.pdf","startPage":"1761","endPage":"1770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Switching-Frequency Active Harmonic Elimination for Multilevel Converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching converters","Switching frequency","Space vector pulse width modulation","Equations","Laboratories","Computational modeling","Total harmonic distortion","Low voltage","Field programmable gate arrays","Electromagnetic interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","harmonic distortion","harmonics suppression","Newton method","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced switching-frequency active harmonic elimination method","multilevel converters","RAHEM method","transcendental equations","low-order harmonics","Newton climbing method","high-order harmonics","frequency-switching scheme","voltage waveform","total harmonic distortion","THD","H-bridge multilevel converter","field-programmable gate-array controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) controller","multilevel converter","reduced switching-frequency active harmonic elimination"]},{"kwd":["multilevel converter","reduced switching frequency active harmonic elimination","FPGA controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Switching-Frequency Active Harmonic Elimination for Multilevel Converters","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4441337/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920917","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Switching-Frequency Active Harmonic Elimination for Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"55tie04-du.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070003S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4441337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4441338,"authors":[{"name":"Zbigniew Gmyrek","affiliation":["Institute of Mechatronics and Information Systems, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4481189/4441338/4441338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zbigniew Gmyrek was born in Bialogard, Poland, in 1961.

The first method is based on the classical separation of loss contributions (hysteresis, eddy-current, and excess losses). The model requires loss contribution separation using iron loss measurements with sinusoidal supply. In this paper, this method will be called the ldquolow-frequency method.rdquo The second method, named the ldquohigh-frequency method,rdquo is based on the assumption that, under pulsewidth modulation supply, the higher order flux density harmonics do not influence the magnetic work conditions. These magnetic conditions depend only on the amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the flux density. In this paper, both the proposed methodologies and the related measurements are described in detail, and the obtained results are compared with the experimental ones. The experimental results show that both methods allow getting excellent results. The high-frequency method is better than the lower one but requires a more complex test bench. Depending on the accuracy required by the user, the more handy method can be chosen, with the guarantee that the estimation errors will be lower than 5%.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04441338.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iron Loss Prediction With PWM Supply Using Low- and High-Frequency Measurements: Analysis and Results Comparison","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iron Loss Prediction With PWM Supply Using Low- and High-Frequency Measurements: Analysis and Results Comparison","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920918","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4441338/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iron Loss Prediction With PWM Supply Using Low- and High-Frequency Measurements: Analysis and Results Comparison","sourcePdf":"55tie04-gmyrek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062225S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4441338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4441339,"authors":[{"name":"Mariusz Malinowski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Mariusz","lastName":"Malinowski","id":"37266741600"},{"name":"Steffen Bernet","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Power Engineering, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Bernet","id":"37266741100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"4441339","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":232,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4475},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"abstract":"Active three-phase pulsewidth-modulated rectifiers are connected to the grid by an inductance or an LCL filter. Although an filter is more effective since it more efficiently attenuates the switching harmonics, it causes stability problems. To enable a stable operation, either a damping resistor or an active damping (AD) algorithm has to be used. However, while a damping resistor causes additional losses, an AD algorithm usually requires extra sensors. To avoid these disadvantages, this paper shows simulation and experimental results of a simple AC voltage sensorless AD solution that is suitable for industrial applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04441339.pdf","startPage":"1876","endPage":"1880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Voltage Sensorless Active Damping Scheme for Three-Phase PWM Converters With an - Filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Pulse width modulation converters","Rectifiers","Filters","Diodes","Zero voltage switching","Pulse width modulation","Switches","Resonance","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","power filters","PWM power convertors","PWM rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage sensorless active damping scheme","three-phase PWM converters","LCL filter","three-phase pulsewidth-modulated rectifiers","switching harmonics","active damping","damping resistor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active damping (AD)","control of three-phase pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) rectifier"," $LCL$ filter"]},{"kwd":["Active damping","control of three-phase PWM rectifier","LCL filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Voltage Sensorless Active Damping Scheme for Three-Phase PWM Converters With an <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$LCL$</tex> </formula> Filter","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4441339/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920931","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Voltage Sensorless Active Damping Scheme for Three-Phase PWM Converters With an <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$LCL$</tex> </formula> Filter","sourcePdf":"55tie04-malinowski-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056086S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4441339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4441340,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxiang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4481189/4441340/4441340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenxiang Zhao (M'08) was born in Jilin, China, in 1976.

In this paper, it is examined that the DSPM motor is a new class of fault-tolerant machines, a potential candidate for many applications where reliability and power density are of importance. Fault analysis is performed in a DSPM motor drive, including internal and external faults. Due to the fact that the experimentation on a true motor drive for such a purpose is impractical because of its high cost and difficulty to make, a new cosimulation model of a DSPM motor drive is developed using coupled magnetic and electric circuit solvers. Last, to improve the performance of a DSPM motor drive with an open-circuited fault, a fault compensation strategy is proposed. Simulation and experimental results are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed cosimulation method and the high performance of the fault-tolerant characteristic of DSPM motor drives.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04441340.pdf","startPage":"1739","endPage":"1748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Fault-Tolerant Performance of a Doubly Salient Permanent-Magnet Motor Drive Using Transient Cosimulation Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441340/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Fault-Tolerant Performance of a Doubly Salient Permanent-Magnet Motor Drive Using Transient Cosimulation Method","volume":"55","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920951","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441340/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Fault-Tolerant Performance of a Doubly Salient Permanent-Magnet Motor Drive Using Transient Cosimulation Method","sourcePdf":"55tie04-zhao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110957S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4441340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441341,"authors":[{"name":"Vassilios G.

In digital controllers for power converters, the main bandwidth limitations come from A/D conversion time, computational delays, and small-signal delay of the digital pulsewidth modulator (DPWM). In hard-wired digital-controller technologies, such as in dedicated digital IC and/or in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), the calculation delays can be made negligible with respect to the switching period; thus, when fast ADCs are used, the overall phase lag is dominated by the DPWM. The multi sampling approach can strongly reduce the DPWM delay, thus breaking the bandwidth limitations of conventional single-sampled solutions. In this paper, the additional aliasing effects, which would require a filtering action, are avoided, exploiting the periodic nature of the switching ripple under steady-state conditions using a repetitive-based filtering action. Simulation and experimental results on a 1.2-V-10-A 500-kHz synchronous buck converter, where the digital control has been implemented in the FPGA, confirm the properties of the proposed solution.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04441343.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Bandwidth Multisampled Digitally Controlled DC\u2013DC Converters Using Ripple Compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Bandwidth Multisampled Digitally Controlled DC\u2013DC Converters Using Ripple Compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920915","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4441343/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Bandwidth Multisampled Digitally Controlled DC\u2013DC Converters Using Ripple Compensation","sourcePdf":"55tie04-corradini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104245S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4441343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4441350,"authors":[{"name":"Tianjian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4481189/4441350/4441350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tianjian Li received the B.S. degree from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2002, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include networked control systems, motion control, and field-programmable gate-array design."]},"firstName":"Tianjian","lastName":"Li","id":"37656928800"},{"name":"Yasutaka Fujimoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4481189/4441350/4441350-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yasutaka Fujimoto (S'93\u2013M'98) was born in Kanagawa, Japan, in 1971.

Communication between different DC-DC converters is obtained by using switching frequency modulation and by detecting the switching signal on the common supply bus voltage. In case of low power transmission, a small duty-cycle perturbation at half of switching frequency is added to enhance the energy of the transmitted signal. Each converter operates at three different switching frequencies: the first is associated with bit 1 transmission, the second is associated with bit 0 transmission, and the third is associated with no transmission state. In the proposed solution, there is no need for an additional power amplifier in order to inject the communication signal on the power lines, but the signal used for the PLC is inherently generated by the pulsewidth modulation of DC-DC converters. Even if aimed at a dedicated digital IC, the communication architecture has been implemented in field-programmable gate arrays. Simulation and experimental results on DC-DC synchronous buck converters confirm that the performance is achievable by the proposed PLC techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917145","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04441353.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"1509","endPage":"1518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Line Communication in Digitally Controlled DC\u2013DC Converters Using Switching Frequency Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power Line Communication in Digitally Controlled DC\u2013DC Converters Using Switching Frequency Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441353/","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4441353/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920940","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Line Communication in Digitally Controlled DC\u2013DC Converters Using Switching Frequency Modulation","sourcePdf":"55tie04-stefanutti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068963S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4441353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4441356,"authors":[{"name":"Leena Vachhani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4481189/4441356/4441356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leena Vachhani (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics from Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg, India, in 1996 and the M.Eng. degree in microprocessors from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (MSU), Vadodara, India, in 2000.

A feature of the proposed approach is that it does not involve operations that are expensive in hardware. Furthermore, no explicit angle computation circuitry is needed. An efficient architecture based on hardware reuse is presented. The design is shown to be space efficient and fits in a low-end field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) device (with a small number of system gates). Detailed experiments with a mobile robot fabricated locally with a Xilinx XC2S200E FPGA and eight ultrasonic sensors onboard validate the efficacy of the proposed approach for static as well as dynamic environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-Efficient Prediction-Correction-Based Generalized-Voronoi-Diagram Construction and FPGA Implementation","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917161","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04441356.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Efficient Prediction-Correction-Based Generalized-Voronoi-Diagram Construction and FPGA Implementation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4441356/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920944","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Efficient Prediction-Correction-Based Generalized-Voronoi-Diagram Construction and FPGA Implementation","sourcePdf":"55tie04-vachhani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084112S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4441356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4441359,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Lyang Jang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Sheng-Lyang","lastName":"Jang","id":"37290716100"},{"name":"Chien-Feng Lee","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chien-Feng","lastName":"Lee","id":"37066035400"},{"name":"Wei-Hsung Yeh","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wei-Hsung","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37823630600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4441359","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1201},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Circuits","Injection-locked oscillators","CMOS process","Voltage","Inductors","Tail","Power harmonic filters","Varactors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","frequency dividers","injection locked oscillators","microwave oscillators","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["divide-by-3 CMOS ILFD","injection locked frequency divider","single-ended input","double cross-coupled LC-tank oscillator","injection MOS","self-oscillating voltage controlled oscillator","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1.8 V","frequency 1.62 GHz to 1.89 GHz","frequency 4.85 GHz to 5.7 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","divide-by-3","inductors","injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD)","LC-tank oscillator"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a new divide-by-3 CMOS injection locked frequency divider (ILFDMOS. ) fabricated in a 0.18-mum CMOS process and describes the operation principle of the ILFD.

The focus of this paper is to investigate the hygroscopic characteristic of stacked die using commercial FEA software. In this study, according to the JEDEC standard, the moisture diffusion characteristic under different conditions is investigated. Results show that the substrate and bottom adhesive absorb rapidly in moisture diffusion simulation. This reduces the mechanical properties of the stacked die and the result may give a proper answer to those failure observed in industry.

Proper scheduling of preventive maintenance provides an effective means to tradeoff between the two objectives.

Markov model is proposed to predict the deterioration process, maintenance operations, and availability of individual components. Minimum cut sets method is employed to identify the critical components by evaluating the overall reliability of interconnected systems.

However, the onus has always been on personnel to accurately decide how serious a problem is and how urgently maintenance is required. In dealing with the large volumes of data involved, it is possible that faults may not be noticed until serious damage has occurred. This paper proposes the integration of a newly developed anomaly detection technique with an existing diagnosis system. By learning a hidden Markov model of healthy transformer behavior, unexpected operation, such as when a fault develops, can be flagged for attention. Faults can then be diagnosed using the existing system and maintenance scheduled as required, all at a much earlier stage than would previously have been possible.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441581/4441582/04441620.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441582","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Models of Plant Behavior for Anomaly Detection and Condition Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Partial discharges","Multiagent systems","Conductors","Fault detection","Hidden Markov models","Intelligent systems","Power transformers","Substation automation","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","decision making","fault diagnosis","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","maintenance engineering","power engineering computing","power plants","power transformer testing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning models","electrical plant operation","anomaly detection technique","condition monitoring","fault diagnosis system","transformers","decision making","maintenance scheduling","hidden Markov model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative systems","Decision support systems","Hidden Markov models","Intelligent systems","Learning systems","Monitoring","Partial discharges","Power systems","Power transformers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Learning Models of Plant Behavior for Anomaly Detection and Condition Monitoring","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441620/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9860066","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Models of Plant Behavior for Anomaly Detection and Condition Monitoring","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056433S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4441621,"authors":[{"name":"Lingxue Lin","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering College, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lingxue Lin was born in Guangdong Province, China, on August, 16th, 1979.

This paper proposes a method to identify different causes leading to commutation failures based on the wavelet transform. By using the technique of wavelet multi-resolution analysis (MRA), the transient signals generated by the faults are decomposed into different resolution levels. The features of each fault are extracted. Two auxiliary parameters are defined as the criteria for the identification, based on which four thresholds are set to distinguish different faults. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach could make a definite identification of commutation failures from DC line faults and normal operations. Furthermore, the discriminations between AC short circuit faults and missing firing faults, which cause commutation failures, also could be obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441581/4441582/04441621.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441582","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of Commutation Failures in HVDC Systems Based on Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HVDC transmission","Wavelet transforms","Circuit faults","Fault diagnosis","Multiresolution analysis","Automatic control","Control systems","Transient analysis","Protection","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","HVDC power transmission","power system measurement","power transmission faults","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC commutation failures","wavelet transforms","DC line faults","control systems","protection control","wavelet multiresolution analysis","transient signals","fault extraction","AC short circuit faults"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HVDC systems","Commutation failures","Wavelet transform","Multi-resolution analysis (MRA)","Fault identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Commutation Failures in HVDC Systems Based on Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441621/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9847450","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Commutation Failures in HVDC Systems Based on Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053741S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAPIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4441631,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Bae Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Bae","lastName":"Park","id":"37281005200"},{"name":"Yun-Won Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun-Won","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37404233500"},{"name":"Joog-Rin Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joog-Rin","lastName":"Shin","id":"37274235500"},{"name":"Kwang Y.

Although PSO-based algorithms are easy to implement and have been empirically shown to perform well on many power system optimization problems, they may get trapped in a local optimum due to premature convergence when solving heavily constrained optimization problems with multiple local optima. This paper proposes an improved hybrid PSO (HPSO), which combines the conventional PSO framework with the crossover operation of genetic algorithm. By applying the crossover operation in PSO, it not only discourages premature convergence to local optimum but also explores and exploits the promising regions in the search space effectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical studies have been performed for the large-scale test system of 40 generating units with valve-point effects. The simulation results show that the proposed HPSO outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms as well as the conventional PSO method in solving ED problems with valve-point effects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9860073","htmlLink":"/document/4441631/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Employing Crossover Operation for Economic Dispatch Problems with Valve-point Effects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Employing Crossover Operation for Economic Dispatch Problems with Valve-point Effects","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140717S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAPIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441645,"authors":[{"name":"Lingfeng Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Lingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280770900"},{"name":"Chanan Singh","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chanan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37271764800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-986-01-2607-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4441645","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind energy generation","Genetic algorithms","Wind power generation","Wind turbines","Power generation","Hybrid power systems","Power system reliability","Uncertainty","Wind energy","Fossil fuels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","genetic algorithms","hybrid power systems","power system reliability","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","adequacy evaluation","hybrid power generation system","wind turbine generators","power systems","wind power","wind resources","search procedure","power generating system","failure states","load expectation loss","load frequency loss","IEEE Reliability Test System"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441645","abstract":"The adequacy of power generation should be properly evaluated to facilitate the reliable operations of power systems under uncertainties.

In the new deregulated framework, producers and consumers require short-term price forecasting to derive their bidding strategies to the electricity market. Accurate forecasting tools are required for producers to maximize their profits and for consumers to maximize their utilities. A three-layered feedforward artificial neural network, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for forecasting the next 168 hour electricity prices. We evaluate the accuracy of the price forecasting attained with the proposed approach, reporting the numerical results from a real-world case study based on an electricity market.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Artificial Neural Network Approach for Short-Term Electricity Prices Forecasting","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441655","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441581/4441582/04441655.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441582","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Artificial Neural Network Approach for Short-Term Electricity Prices Forecasting","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441655/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9860088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Artificial Neural Network Approach for Short-Term Electricity Prices Forecasting","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063103S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4441657,"authors":[{"name":"Atsushi Yona","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Yona","id":"37404086600"},{"name":"Tomonobu Senjyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomonobu","lastName":"Senjyu","id":"37275165700"},{"name":"Ahmed Yousuf Saber","affiliation":["Toyota Technological Institute, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Ahmed Yousuf","lastName":"Saber","id":"37394621500"},{"name":"Toshihisa Funabashi","affiliation":["Meidensha Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihisa","lastName":"Funabashi","id":"37275181600"},{"name":"Hideomi Sekine","affiliation":["Department of Education Technology, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideomi","lastName":"Sekine","id":"37275241900"},{"name":"Chul-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chul-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279782300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-986-01-2607-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4441657","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1314},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441657","abstract":"In recent years, introduction of an alternative energy source such as solar energy is expected.

Their ability to capture the non linear dependencies among the system variables has invited economic analysts towards their use in the field of financial time series prediction. Although simple neural networks with sufficient number neuron units in the hidden layer are capable of following dynamics of any deterministic system, the weight search space becomes too complex to be searched using a simple back propagation based training algorithm. This paper presents and evaluates two alternative methods for finding the optimum weights of a neural network to capture the chaotic dynamics of electricity price data. The first method uses evolutionary algorithm to evolve a neural network, and the second method uses particle swarm optimization for NN training. The global search capabilities of these evolutionary methods is used for finding the optimum neural network for forecasting electricity price from the California Power Exchange.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441660","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441581/4441582/04441660.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electricity Price Forecasting Using Evolved Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Economic forecasting","Space exploration","Power generation economics","Time series analysis","Neurons","Chaos","Evolutionary computation","Particle swarm optimization","Power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","power markets","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity price forecasting","evolved neural networks","evolutionary techniques","optimum weights","chaotic dynamics","particle swarm optimization","California Power Exchange"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Electricity Price Forecasting Using Evolved Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441660/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9860091","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electricity Price Forecasting Using Evolved Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043368S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAPIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441668,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Hung Huang","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4441581/4441582/4441668/4441668-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Hung Huang received his M.S. from Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, 1997.

By changing on/off status of sectionalizing-switches and tie-switches on a distribution system, feeder reconfiguration can be achieved. Also, the configured system must satisfy operation conditions as well as restrictions. Since the reconfiguration is done by changing the status of switches, it can be categorized as a discrete combinational optimization problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is the one of the methods that can be used to solve optimal problems. Typical PSO is designed for continuous functions optimization, it is not designed for discrete functions optimization. Therefore, the operators of PSO algorithm must be reviewed and redefined to fit the application field of distribution feeder reconfiguration. This paper proposed a method which modifies the operators of PSO's formula based on the characters of both status of switches and shift operator to construct the binary coding particle swarm optimization for feeder reconfiguration. The test results show that the proposed method can apply to feeder reconfiguration effectively.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441672","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441581/4441582/04441672.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Binary Coding Particle Swarm Optimization for Feeder Reconfiguration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Binary Coding Particle Swarm Optimization for Feeder Reconfiguration","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9860098","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4441672/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Binary Coding Particle Swarm Optimization for Feeder Reconfiguration","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052861S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441677,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This paper proposes a methodology based on neural networks for the distribution of power distribution losses among the loads. The process is based on the knowledge of load profiles and on the usual consumption measures. Simulations are carried out for a typical MV network, with an extensive variety of load scenarios. For each scenario, losses were calculated and distributed by the consumers. The allocation criterion is established assuming a distribution proportional to the squared power. Finally, a neural network is trained in order to obtain a fast and accurate losses allocation. Illustrative results support the feasibility of the proposed methodology.","doi":"10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441685","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441581/4441582/04441685.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Applications to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAP.2007.4441685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Allocation of Distribution Losses based on Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fair Allocation of Distribution Losses based on Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9860105","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4441685/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Allocation of Distribution Losses based on Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06061S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441693,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Nam Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Nam","lastName":"Lee","id":"37674775400"},{"name":"Yun-Won Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun-Won","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37404233500"},{"name":"Jong-Bae Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Bae","lastName":"Park","id":"37281005200"},{"name":"Joong-Rin Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joong-Rin","lastName":"Shin","id":"37274235500"},{"name":"Kwang Y.

The simulator can be used as a lecturing tool to stimulate an interest in the power system engineering of the undergraduate students. The students can be more familiar with the optimization problems including power system ED problem through the iterative uses of the simulator. Also, they can increase understandings on PSO mechanism by the homework on the optimal design of several control parameters such as inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and the number of population, etc. In the developed simulator, instructors and students can select the optimization functions and set the parameters that have an influence on PSO performance. The simulator is applied not only to mathematical optimization functions but also to economic dispatch (ED) problems with non-smooth cost functions, which is designed so that users can solve other mathematical functions through simple additional MATLAB coding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441693/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9860112","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441693/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Development of an Educational Simulator for Particle Swarm Optimization and Economic Dispatch Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an Educational Simulator for Particle Swarm Optimization and Economic Dispatch Applications","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ISAP07-00-111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126277S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441581","isNumber":"4441582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441581","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4441582","articleId":"4441693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISAPIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441694,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological data set to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological data set from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate laboratory setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity, and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, and positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. An improved recognition accuracy of 95 percent and 70 percent for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.26","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4670323/04441720.pdf","startPage":"2067","endPage":"2083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4670323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion recognition based on physiological changes in music listening","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Emotion recognition based on physiological changes in music listening","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441720/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10313080","pubMedId":"18988943","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441720/","volume":"30","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion recognition based on physiological changes in music listening","sourcePdf":"ttp2008122067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110674S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4670323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"542","xplore-issue":"4670323","articleId":"4441720","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4441722,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Yuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4479660/4441722/4441722-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ching-Yuan Yang (S'97\u2013M'01) was born in Miaoli, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1967.

Over the past few decades, most efforts have been devoted to beamforming techniques, which aim at recovering the desired source signal from the outputs of an array of microphones. In order to work reasonably well in reverberant environments, this approach often requires such knowledge as the direction of arrival (DOA) or even the room impulse responses, which are difficult to acquire reliably in practice. In addition, beamforming has to compromise its noise reduction performance in order to achieve speech dereverberation at the same time. This paper presents a new multichannel algorithm for noise reduction, which formulates the problem as one of estimating the speech component observed at one microphone using the observations from all the available microphones. This new approach explicitly uses the idea of spatial\u2013temporal prediction and achieves noise reduction in two steps. The first step is to determine a set of inter-sensor optimal spatial\u2013temporal prediction transformations. These transformations are then exploited in the second step to form an optimal noise-reduction filter. In comparison with traditional beamforming techniques, this new method has many appealing properties: it does not require DOA information or any knowledge of either the reverberation condition or the channel impulse responses; the multiple microphones do not have to be arranged into a specific array geometry; it works the same for both the far-field and near-field cases; and, most importantly, it can produce very good and robust noise reduction with minimum speech distortion in practical environments. Furthermore, with this new approach, it is possible to apply postprocessing filtering for additional noise reduction when a specified level of speech distortion is allowed. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Speech enhancement","Microphone arrays","Speech processing","Noise level","Array signal processing","Wiener filter","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Jacobian matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","microphone arrays","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum distortion noise reduction algorithm","multiple microphones","direction of arrival","multichannel algorithm","speech component estimation","intersensor optimal spatial-temporal prediction transformation","optimal noise-reduction filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC)","linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)","microphone arrays","minimum-mean-square error (MMSE)","minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)","noise reduction","speech enhancement"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.914969","startPage":"481","endPage":"493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4451143/04441731.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.914969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Minimum Distortion Noise Reduction Algorithm With Multiple Microphones","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Minimum Distortion Noise Reduction Algorithm With Multiple Microphones","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9870016","publicationDate":"March 2008","volume":"16","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441731/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Minimum Distortion Noise Reduction Algorithm With Multiple Microphones","sourcePdf":"16tasl03-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100939S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4451143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4451143","articleId":"4441731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4441732,"authors":[{"name":"Richard C.

Since the noise PSD is unknown in advance, estimation from the noisy speech signal is necessary. An overestimation of the noise PSD will lead to a loss in speech quality, while an underestimation will lead to an unnecessary high level of residual noise. We present a novel approach for noise tracking, which updates the noise PSD for each DFT coefficient in the presence of both speech and noise. This method is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of correlation matrices that are constructed from time series of noisy DFT coefficients. The presented method is very well capable of tracking gradually changing noise types. In comparison to state-of-the-art noise tracking algorithms the proposed method reduces the estimation error between the estimated and the true noise PSD. In combination with an enhancement system the proposed method improves the segmental SNR with several decibels for gradually changing noise types. Listening experiments show that the proposed system is preferred over the state-of-the-art noise tracking algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Tracking Using DFT Domain Subspace Decompositions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.914977","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4451143/04441732.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.914977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451143","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Noise Tracking Using DFT Domain Subspace Decompositions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4441732/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9870020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Tracking Using DFT Domain Subspace Decompositions","sourcePdf":"16tasl03-hendriks.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093402S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4451143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4451143","articleId":"4441732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4441747,"authors":[{"name":"Xing-peng Mao","affiliation":["School of Information and Control Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, Shandong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4441733/4441747/4441747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xingpeng Mao (M'06) was born in Liaoning, P.R.

To avoid this, a null phase-shift polarization (NPSP) filter is proposed, which is composed of a linear polarization transformer (LPVT), a conventional single-notch polarization (SNP) filter and an amplitude/phase compensation device (A/PCD). The interference, which has polarization different from those of the desired target signal, can be suppressed completely while the target signal remains without distortion. Some applications of high-frequency (HF) radars for suppressing the radio interference are introduced. Simulation results from the experimentally derived data indicate that the improvement of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be expected to be more than 28 dB. The proposed NPSP filter is effective in HF radar or other coherent systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  2007","volume":"43","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"9825903","publicationDate":"October 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441747/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Null phase-shift polarization filtering for high-frequency radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Null phase-shift polarization filtering for high-frequency radar","sourcePdf":"43aes04-Mao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050794S","chronDate":"October  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4441733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4441733","articleId":"4441747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4441748,"authors":[{"name":"Darko Musicki","affiliation":["Univ. of Melbourne, Melbourne"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4441733/4441748/4441748-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Darko Mu\u0161icki was born in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1957.

This allows for the efficient generation and management of possible target hypotheses, yielding an algorithm with performance that matches what can be obtained by multiple hypothesis tracking-based approaches, but at a significantly lower computational cost. This paper considers only the single target case for clarity. The extension to multiple targets is easily incorporated into this framework.

For applications in which this filter is appropriate, it is likely to be tractable for only a small number of targets. In earlier papers we derived closed-form equations for an approximation of this filter based on propagation of a first-order multitarget moment called the probability hypothesis density (PHD). In a recent paper, Erdinc, Willett, and Bar-Shalom argued for the need for a PHD-type filter which remains first-order in the states of individual targets, but which is higher-order in target number. In this paper we show that this is indeed possible. We derive a closed-form cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter, which propagates not only the PHD but also the entire probability distribution on target number.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear filters","Target tracking","Nonlinear equations","Probability distribution","Electronic mail","Filtering","State-space methods","Integral equations","Poisson equations","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","nonlinear filters","probability","recursive filters","sensor fusion","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability hypothesis density filters","multitarget recursive Bayes nonlinear filter","multisensor-multitarget detection","multitarget tracking","multitarget identification","closed-form equations","first-order multitarget moment","closed-form cardinalized filter","probability distribution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAES.2007.4441756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4441733/04441756.pdf","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2007.4441756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PHD filters of higher order in target number","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PHD filters of higher order in target number","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441756/","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"October 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441756/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9825912","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"October  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PHD filters of higher order in target number","sourcePdf":"43aes04-Mahler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143399S","chronDate":"October  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4441733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"539","xplore-issue":"4441733","articleId":"4441756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":4441773,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Seo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Communication Engineering, HongIk University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4626110/4441773/4441773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byung-Seo Kim (S'04\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from In-Ha University, In-Chon, Korea, in 1998 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","Between 1997 and 1999, he was with Motorola Korea Ltd., Paju, Korea, as a Computer Integrated Manufacturing Engineer in Advanced Technology Research and Development. from January 2005 to August 2007, he was with Motorola Inc., Schaumburg, IL, as a Senior Software Engineer in Networks and Enterprises.

In addition, although the existing wireless standards provide reliable unicast methods using an automatic repeat request (ARQ) and a retransmission, multicast packets are not reliably transmitted using these standards. To retransmit a multicast packet, the acknowledgements (ACKs) from the receivers need to be received by the sender to determine whether a retransmission is required. However, transmitting an ACK from each group member degrades the network performance due to the overhead induced by multiple ACK packet transmissions and channel access processes for the ACKs. To solve this problem, in this paper, a medium-access control protocol called the orthogonal frequency division multiplex access (OFDMA) based multicast ACK (OMACK), with minimum ACK overhead over wireless local area networks, is proposed. The proposed scheme uses one orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) symbol for the ACKs from all member stations (STAs), and each member STA indicates its packet reception status by utilizing a subcarrier within the OFDM symbol. The proposed scheme is thoroughly examined by using simulation and theoretical methods, and the results show that it significantly reduces the aforementioned overhead and, as a consequence, improves the performance of wireless networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04441773.pdf","startPage":"3136","endPage":"3145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA-Based Reliable Multicasting MAC Protocol for WLANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Multicast protocols","Unicast","Wireless application protocol","Automatic repeat request","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","Wireless communication","Communication standards","Telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA-based reliable multicasting MAC protocol","WLAN","wireless communication standards","automatic repeat request","medium-access control protocol","orthogonal frequency division multiplex access","OFDMA based multicast ACK","wireless local area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medium-access control (MAC)","multicast","orthogonal frequency division multiplex access (OFDMA)","wireless LAN"]},{"kwd":["MAC","Multicast","OFDMA","Wireless LAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA-Based Reliable Multicasting MAC Protocol for WLANs","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4441773/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222400","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA-Based Reliable Multicasting MAC Protocol for WLANs","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-bkim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094936S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4441773","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4441774,"authors":[{"name":"Samir V.

This paper extends game-theoretic analysis to the study of link adaptation, which involves the variation of modulation parameters, in addition to PC. We use the link adaptation scheme in general packet radio service (GPRS) as an example, although the basic approach is applicable to any centralized wireless system with power and rate control. The action space of a player in our proposed game, which is called the link adaptation game (LAG), consists of power, as usual, and a discrete-valued adaptable link parameter (ALP), e.g., code rate. The utility function is a sigmoid (which is fitted to the throughput characteristics of a link adaptation scheme) priced by the square of power. We first show the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) in the game. Next, we propose a distributed algorithm to discover the NE. The algorithm is analytically shown to converge to an NE by treating it as a point-to-set map. Simulation results using the GPRS system demonstrate superior throughput and fair system-wide allocation of resources in comparison with other non game-theoretic methods.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04441774.pdf","startPage":"3108","endPage":"3120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Link Adaptation in Cellular Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441774/","displayDocTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Link Adaptation in Cellular Radio Networks","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222409","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441774/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Link Adaptation in Cellular Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-ginde.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088464S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4441774","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4441776,"authors":[{"name":"Sumei Sun","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sumei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278775200"},{"name":"Yan Wu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281223600"},{"name":"Yuan Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37279885400"},{"name":"Tjeng Thiang Tjhung","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tjeng Thiang","lastName":"Tjhung","id":"37276664700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4441776","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441776","abstract":"In conventional interference cancellation (IC)-based turbo receivers, extrinsic information (EXT) from the soft-input-soft-output (SISO) decoders is used to compute the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">statistical</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mean</i>\n (SM) of the interfering signals.

The channel model incorporates the effects of propagation loss and shadowing with Rayleigh fading. By deriving the cumulative distribution function of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) of a certain link in the network, the outage probability of the link is analyzed. In particular, the analysis works for the arbitrary beam patterns of the directional antennas used in the networks. Moreover, we propose a new parameter, i.e., the array interference factor, which can characterize the average performance of an arbitrary beam pattern in random wireless networks. This provides an efficient way for designers to evaluate the system performance under different beam patterns. The network throughput and the transport capacity of a random wireless network with directional antennas are also analyzed. It is shown that the network transport capacity is of the same order as the square root of the node density, which conforms with the well-known capacity of wireless networks. The analysis is useful for designers to optimize the system performance of wireless networks with directional antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10222439","htmlLink":"/document/4441777/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Wireless Networks With Directional Antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Wireless Networks With Directional Antennas","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-yeh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097475S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4441777","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4441783,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Lee","affiliation":["Electronics Department, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Lee","id":"37289658600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0796-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0797-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0631"}],"articleNumber":"4441783","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Neurons","Signal processing algorithms","Neural networks","Performance evaluation","Arithmetic","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing","Testing","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","search problems","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","neural network cell","reactive tabu search training algorithm","hybrid-logarithmic number system","fixed-point methods"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the design of a test chip implementation of a multiply and accumulate (MAC) unit for a neural network cell that has been optimized for use with the reactive tabu search (RTS) training algorithm.

A Committee machine (CM) is used in which the results from each classifier are first transformed to confidences and then a weighted combination rule is used to generate the final decision result. In order to overcome the problem of very high computational complexity of the CM requiring large amount of hardware resources, we propose a novel time multiplexing hardware implementation using a dynamically reconfigurable field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. The system is successfully tested for combustible gas identification application using our in-house tin-oxide gas sensors.","doi":"10.1109/ISICIR.2007.4441827","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441779/4441780/04441827.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISICIR.2007.4441827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Based Run Time Reconfigurable Gas Discrimination System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441827/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Based Run Time Reconfigurable Gas Discrimination System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9833123","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441827/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Based Run Time Reconfigurable Gas Discrimination System","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ISIC-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058225S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441779","isNumber":"4441780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441779","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4441780","articleId":"4441827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441829,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Digital Signal Processing Lab, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280024200"},{"name":"Woon-Seng Gan","affiliation":["Digital Signal Processing Lab, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Woon-Seng","lastName":"Gan","id":"37268712600"},{"name":"Xiaomeng Shi","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaomeng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37555311300"},{"name":"Kiat-Seng Yeo","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits and Systems, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kiat-Seng","lastName":"Yeo","id":"37277042100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0796-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0797-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0631"}],"articleNumber":"4441829","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Very large scale integration","Wavelet packets","Computer architecture","Hardware","Concurrent computing","Frequency","Pipelines","Parallel architectures","Read-write memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architectures","lifting-based discrete wavelet packet transform","folded architecture","configurable processing element","circuit simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, dedicated hardware implementations for discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) are investigated. After an intensive review of the exiting DWPT architectures, a folded architecture for lifting-based DWPT is proposed. Based on the previous pipeline DWPT architecture, this folded architecture reduces the hardware complexity significantly by folding multilevel DWPT decomposition into a single configurable processing element (PE). Compared with the conventional single-PE DWPT architecture, this folded architecture does not require extra memory to buffer the intermediate data during the DWPT computation and therefore avoids intensive memory access. Circuit simulation and implementation results demonstrate that the proposed folded architecture computes the multilevel DWPT much faster than the conventional single-PE architecture, while the hardware cost of the two architectures are almost identical.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Architectures for Lifting-Based Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform","doi":"10.1109/ISICIR.2007.4441829","startPage":"188","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISICIR.2007.4441829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4441780","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4441779/4441780/04441829.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Architectures for Lifting-Based Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441829/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9833097","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Architectures for Lifting-Based Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ISIC-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037421S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4441779","isNumber":"4441780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4441779","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4441780","articleId":"4441829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4441832,"authors":[{"name":"Grani A.

Matrix inversion is used as an example to illustrate the design and operation of such a reconfiguration system. The proposed platform consists of a configurable module, in this case, a scalable CORDIC based QR factorization core designed for matrix inversion and a fixed module to support the dynamic partial reconfiguration.

In this paper, a systematic empirical study of the tradeoffs between degree of parallelism, threshold voltage and power consumption under constant throughput conditions commercially available FPGAs has been presented.

The BS has multiple geographically distributed arrays, each consisting of multiple transmit antennas. The scenario comprises a number of downlink multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels from different BS arrays to an MS with mutually independent Rayleigh-fading processes. A data frame from the BS for the MS is split into portions, which are consecutively transmitted from multiple BS arrays. For the FS transmission scheme, the distribution of information capacity is formulated on the basis of the FS fractional lengths of the portions. Analytical evaluation of the outage probability reveals the optimal setting of FS fractional lengths for the maximum diversity advantage based on knowledge of the long-term average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the downlink MIMO channels.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04441943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","startPage":"3848","endPage":"3854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Frame Splitting for Downlink MIMO Channels With Distributed Antenna Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Frame Splitting for Downlink MIMO Channels With Distributed Antenna Arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312141","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4441943/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Frame Splitting for Downlink MIMO Channels With Distributed Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-csun-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066335S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4441943","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4441944,"authors":[{"name":"Yoora Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences and Telecommunication Engineering Program, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Yoora","lastName":"Kim","id":"37836151600"},{"name":"Gang Uk Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences and Telecommunication Engineering Program, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Gang Uk","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37276190400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4441944","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441944","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Fading","Feedback","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Analytical models","Numerical simulation","Delay systems","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","multiuser channels","Nakagami channels","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","M-QAM scheme","multiuser diversity","Nakagami-m fading channels","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","error-free signal-to-noise ratio feedback","bit error rate","feedback delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average bit error rate (BER)","average transmission rate","feedback delay","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM)","multiuser diversity","Nakagami-$m$ fading"]},{"kwd":["Multiuser diversity","Nakagami-m fading","feedback delay","M-QAM","average transmission rate","average BER"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04441944.pdf","startPage":"3251","endPage":"3257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of M-QAM Scheme Combined With Multiuser Diversity Over Nakagami- - Fading Channels","abstract":"In this paper, we consider an M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) scheme combined with multiuser diversity over Nakagami-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n fading channels.

In contrast with previous schemes, which assume a constant channel during the cooperative frame (several slots), here, we relax this constraint and assume a classical quasi-static block- fading channel (constant for one slot). This additional degree of freedom modifies the behavior of the conventional nonorthogonal AF (NAF) schemes and generates a new block-fading NAF (BFNAF) protocol, where the source can usefully retransmit the same data during the cooperative slot. This new protocol is interesting at low spectral efficiencies, where diversity against fading is more important. To overcome performance degradation, which characterizes cooperative schemes at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), an adaptive version of the considered schemes is also proposed, where cooperation is activated according to the outage behavior of the direct link. Moreover, an optimal hybrid protocol that allows intelligent switching between noncooperation, NAF, and BFNAF protocols is also proposed. Another issue that is discussed throughout this paper is the optimal power allocation of the investigated schemes. The proposed power-allocation strategy uses as an optimization criterion the well-defined asymptotic expressions of the outage probabilities, which are averaged over the fading statistics. The minimization (and avoidance for the nonhybrid protocols) of the required data feedback makes it suitable for practical ad hoc networks with crucial power constraints. The enhancement of the proposed schemes and the efficiency of the power allocation policy are shown by theoretical analysis and simulation results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04441945.pdf","endPage":"2884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization Issues for Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward Systems Over Block-Fading Channels","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917235","startPage":"2868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimization Issues for Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward Systems Over Block-Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441945/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10222421","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4441945/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization Issues for Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward Systems Over Block-Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-krikidis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083733S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4441945","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4441946,"authors":[{"name":"Ronghong Mo","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ronghong","lastName":"Mo","id":"37285561700"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Huat","lastName":"Chew","id":"37280653600"},{"name":"Tjeng Thiang Tjhung","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tjeng Thiang","lastName":"Tjhung","id":"37276664700"},{"name":"Chi Chung Ko","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chi Chung","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279881600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4441946","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":295},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Frequency-selective fading channels","Delay estimation","Bit error rate","Frequency division multiplexing","Maximum likelihood estimation","Newton method","Time domain analysis","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","expectation-maximisation algorithm","fading channels","Gaussian processes","mean square error methods","Newton method","OFDM modulation","random processes","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM-based semiblind joint channel estimation","expectation-maximization","frequency offset estimator","OFDM system","frequency-selective fading channels","carrier frequency offset","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","maximum-likelihood criterion","Newton method","time-domain OFDM signal","Gaussian random variable","closed-form expression","mean-square-error method","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation","channel estimation","expectation\u2013maximization (EM)","maximum likelihood (ML)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]},{"kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","Carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation","Channel estimation","Maximum likelihood (ML)","Expectation maximization (EM)"]}],"abstract":"We propose an estimator that will jointly estimate the channel and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on the maximum-likelihood criterion. The proposed estimator uses only one received OFDM symbol to perform estimation and does not require the knowledge of power delay profile, except that the number of delay paths should be known. The search range for the CFO is first partitioned into a number of subranges. The expectation-maximization (EM) and Newton's methods are then used within each subrange in an alternative manner to jointly obtain the channel and the CFO estimates. By assuming that the transmitted time-domain OFDM signals can be modeled as Gaussian random variables, we show that the EM method has closed-form expressions and, thus, can be efficiently implemented. We then study the mean-square-error (MSE) performance of the estimator under various signal-to-noise (SNRs) ratios and various numbers of cyclic prefix samples through simulations. Finally, we compare the performance of our proposed estimator with that of some existing estimators in terms of bit error rate (BER). Our simulation results show that the proposed estimator performs better than the reported estimator, which sequentially estimates the channel and the CFO. By suitably choosing the number of subranges, our estimator also performs better than a reported estimator, which makes use of pilot symbols to obtain the initial CFO and channel estimates and then uses a decision-directed technique for overall eventual estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04441946.pdf","startPage":"3275","endPage":"3282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EM-Based Semiblind Joint Channel and Frequency Offset Estimator for OFDM Systems Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441946/","displayDocTitle":"An EM-Based Semiblind Joint Channel and Frequency Offset Estimator for OFDM Systems Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222426","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4441946/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EM-Based Semiblind Joint Channel and Frequency Offset Estimator for OFDM Systems Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-mo-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113228S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4441946","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4441949,"authors":[{"name":"Tamer A.

The most popular criterion for linear beamforming is the minimum mean square error (MMSE). However, the mean square error (MSE) cost function is not optimal in terms of the bit error probability performance of the system. A class of adaptive beamforming algorithms has been proposed based on minimizing the bit error rate (BER) cost function directly. Unfortunately, the popular least minimum BER (LMBER) stochastic beamforming algorithm suffers from low convergence speed. Gradient Newton algorithms have been proposed to speed up the convergence rate and enhance performance but at the expense of complexity. In this paper, a block processing objective function for the minimum BER (MBER) is formulated, and a nonlinear optimization strategy, which produces the so-called block-Shanno MBER (BSMBER), is developed. A complete discussion for the complexity calculations of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. Simulation scenarios are carried out in a multipath Rayleigh-fading direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system to explore the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm offers good performance in terms of convergence speed, steady-state performance, and even system capacity compared to other MBER- and MSE-based algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","startPage":"2981","endPage":"2990","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04441949.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Shanno Minimum Bit Error Rate Beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4441949/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Block-Shanno Minimum Bit Error Rate Beamforming","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222430","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Shanno Minimum Bit Error Rate Beamforming","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-samir.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07198S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4441949","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4441951,"authors":[{"name":"Siyang Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310596000"},{"name":"Zhendong Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhendong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37558773700"},{"name":"Yuanan Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"},{"name":"Jinchun Gao","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinchun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37558738800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4441951","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1571},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> In this paper, we analyze the recently proposed downlink space-time-frequency spreading code-division multiple-access (STFS-CDMA) scheme. A spreading code design criterion is first derived for STFS-CDMA. From the spreading code design criterion, we can see that the two original spreading codes adopted in STFS-CDMA, i.e., the Walsh\u2013Hadamard code (WHC) and the double-orthogonal code (DOC), both cannot achieve full space and frequency diversity, no matter how many users exist in the system. Then, a novel spreading code, i.e., permutated DOC (PDOC), is proposed. PDOC-coded STFS-CDMA (PDOC-STFS-CDMA) can obtain full space and frequency diversity when the number of users in the system is only one, but it cannot obtain full space and frequency diversity when the number of users is larger than one. To mitigate this problem, a zero-padded rotary fast Fourier transform code (ZPRFC) is proposed. Compared with WHC-coded STFS-CDMA (WHC-STFS-CDMA), DOC-coded STFS-CDMA (DOC-STFS-CDMA), and PDOC-STFS-CDMA, ZPRFC-coded STFS-CDMA (ZPRFC-STFS-CDMA) cannot only always obtain full space and frequency diversity but can also result in a low-complexity receiver at the cost of the reduction of the number of supporting users. Finally, the simulation results are given to compare with the performances of WHC-STFS-CDMA, DOC-STFSCDMA, PDOC-STFS-CDMA, and ZPRFC-STFS-CDMA. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Frequency diversity","OFDM","MIMO","Intersymbol interference","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Diversity reception","Bandwidth","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fast Fourier transforms","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time-frequency spreading scheme","code-division multiple-access","downlink STFS-CDMA scheme","spreading code design criterion","double-orthogonal code","permutated DOC","frequency diversity","zero-padded rotary fast Fourier transform code","ZPRFC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems","space-time-frequency spreading code-division multipleaccess (STFS-CDMA)"]},{"kwd":["Space-time-frequency spreading CDMA (STFS-CDMA)","multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04441951.pdf","startPage":"2933","endPage":"2946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spreading Code Design for Downlink Space-Time-Frequency Spreading CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4441951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spreading Code Design for Downlink Space-Time-Frequency Spreading CDMA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4441951/","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10222431","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spreading Code Design for Downlink Space-Time-Frequency Spreading CDMA","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-sliu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030204S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4441951","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4441952,"authors":[{"name":"Fang-Biau Ueng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4626110/4441952/4441952-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang-Biau Ueng received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1995.","From 1996 to 2001, he was with the National Space Program Office, Taiwan, as an Associate Researcher. from 2001 to 2002, he was with Siemens Telecommunication Systems Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan, where he was involved in the design of mobile communication systems.

First, we employ the total least squares (TLS) method and the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) to construct the multiuser detector structures. Second, we use the least mean square algorithm in the TLS-based and ESPRIT-based multiuser detectors to develop four adaptive receivers.

Its root could be traced back hundreds of years ago when ancient Chinese suggested a team approach to problem solving. For a long time, engineers have used the divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose a complex problem into simpler sub-problems and then solve them by a group of solvers. However, knowing the best way to divide a complex problem into simpler ones relies heavily on the available domain knowledge. It is often a manual process by an experienced engineer. There have been few automatic divide-and-conquer methods reported in the literature. Fortunately, evolutionary computation provides some of the interesting avenues to automatic divide-and-conquer methods. An in-depth study of such methods reveals that there is a deep underlying connection between evolutionary computation and ANN ensembles. Ideas in one area can be usefully transferred into another in producing effective algorithms. For example, using speciation to create and maintain diversity had inspired the development of negative correlation learning for ANN ensembles, and an in-depth study of diversity in ensembles. This paper will review some of the recent work in evolutionary approaches to designing ANN ensembles.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2007.913386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4442242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2007.913386","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/4442242/04442253.pdf","startPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving artificial neural network ensembles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4442253/","displayDocTitle":"Evolving artificial neural network ensembles","volume":"3","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9901198","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4442253/","publicationDate":"February 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving artificial neural network ensembles","sourcePdf":"11-03mci01-yao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131445S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"4442242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4442242","articleId":"4442253","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4442281,"authors":[{"name":"Ewa Hermanowicz","affiliation":["Multimedia Systems Department, Faculty of Electronics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Ewa","lastName":"Hermanowicz","id":"37443104900"},{"name":"Hakan Johansson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37274443200"},{"name":"Miroslaw Rojewski","affiliation":["Teleinformation Networks Department, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Miroslaw","lastName":"Rojewski","id":"37621053500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4442281","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Delay estimation","Discrete transforms","Filtering","Frequency response","Digital filters","Adaptive filters","Detectors","Informatics","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay filters","discrete time filters","Hilbert transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hilbert transform filter","discrete-time filter","FD HTF","variable fractional delay filters","VFD filters","discrete-time signal","compound filter","modular structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex Hilbert transform","Farrow structure","fractional-delay (FD) filter","maximally flat finite-impulse response (FIR) approximation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4442281","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.912777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel complex discrete-time filter.

It is capable of performing the Hilbertian as well as VFD filtering of the incoming discrete-time signal at the same time. Thus, one can substitute a cascade of the HTF and the VFD filters with an aggregated filter proposed here. The technique is simple to implement. The advantages lie in lower total delay introduced by the compound filter and in a modular structure. The rotated VFD filters in the pair differ only in the value of one parameter - the VFD. The proposed FD HTF can be applied to adaptive quadrature sub-sample estimation of delay.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.912777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4522633","startPage":"452","endPage":"456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4522633/04442281.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fractionally Delaying Complex Hilbert Transform Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4442281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4442281/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Fractionally Delaying Complex Hilbert Transform Filter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9980893","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fractionally Delaying Complex Hilbert Transform Filter","sourcePdf":"55tcsii05-hermanowicz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054347S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4522633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4522633","articleId":"4442281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4443164,"authors":[{"name":"Jan T.

This protocol can be used for delay-tolerant applications such as underwater ecological sensor networks between energy-limited nodes. Our protocol differs significantly from ALOHA, multiple access with collision avoidance (MACA), and the media access protocol for wireless LANs (MACAW) in that energy is the main performance metric in our case rather than bandwidth utilization. We show that under a realistic underwater sensor network scenario, our MAC protocol wastes only 4% of the transmit energy and only 1.5% of the receive energy due to collisions, when the average number of neighbors is four, and the duty cycle is 0.004. This distributed, scalable MAC protocol has the potential to serve as a primer for the development of energy-efficient MAC protocols for future underwater sensor networks.","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4443156/04443171.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2007.899277","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2007.899277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443171","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Underwater acoustics","Wireless sensor networks","Access protocols","Propagation delay","Acoustic sensors","Collision avoidance","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","telecommunication congestion control","underwater acoustic communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient MAC protocol","underwater acoustic wireless sensor networks","energy-efficient media access control protocol","underwater acoustic medium","underwater ecological sensor networks","collision avoidance","wireless LAN","bandwidth utilization","sensor network scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy","media access control (MAC)","protocol","sensor","underwater acoustic","wireless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"UWAN-MAC: An Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Wireless Sensor Networks","accessionNumber":"9757315","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4443171/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWAN-MAC: An Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"32joe03-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077617S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4443156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"4443156","articleId":"4443171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4443172,"authors":[{"name":"Subhadeep Roy","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4443156/4443172/4443172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Subhadeep Roy received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from Maharaja SayajiRao University, Baroda, India, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","Since October 2006, he has been a Senior Engineer with Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, Bridgewater, NJ.

Recent advances in information theory have shown that significant capacity gains can be achieved by using multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems and space-time coding techniques for rich scattering environments. This is especially significant for the UWA channel where the usable bandwidth is severely limited due to frequency-dependent attenuation. In this paper, we propose to use space-time coding and iterative decoding techniques to obtain high data rates and reliability over shallow-water, medium-range UWA channels. In particular, we propose to use space-time trellis codes (STTCs), layered space-time codes (LSTCs) and their combinations along with three low-complexity adaptive equalizer structures at the receiver. We consider multiband transmissions where the available bandwidth is divided into several subbands with guard bands in between them. We describe the theoretical basis of the proposed receivers along with a comprehensive set of experimental results obtained by processing data collected from real UWA communications experiments carried out in the Pacific Ocean. We demonstrate that by using space-time coding at the transmitter and sophisticated iterative processing at the receiver, we can obtain data rates and spectral efficiencies that are not possible with single transmitter systems at similar ranges and depths. In particular, we have demonstrated reliable transmission at a data rate of 48 kb/s in 23 kHz of bandwidth, and 12 kb/s in 3 kHz of bandwidth (a spectral efficiency of 4 bs\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\nHz\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n) at a 2-km range.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"663","endPage":"688","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2007.899275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2007.899275","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4443156/04443172.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Rate Communication for Underwater Acoustic Channels Using Multiple Transmitters and Space\u2013Time Coding: Receiver Structures and Experimental Results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443172/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"High-Rate Communication for Underwater Acoustic Channels Using Multiple Transmitters and Space\u2013Time Coding: Receiver Structures and Experimental Results","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9757316","volume":"32","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4443172/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Rate Communication for Underwater Acoustic Channels Using Multiple Transmitters and Space\u2013Time Coding: Receiver Structures and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"32joe03-roy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116462S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4443156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"4443156","articleId":"4443172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4443175,"authors":[{"name":"Blair Thornton","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK","Underwater Robotics and Application (URA) Laboratory, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4443156/4443175/4443175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Blair Thornton (M'07) received the B.Eng. degree in ship science and the Ph.D. degree in underwater robotics from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","He joined the Underwater Robotics and Application (URA) Laboratory, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2003, where he spent three years as a Research Student and is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher.

Beamforming suppresses ISI (and noise) by eliminating multipath (and noise) arrivals outside the signal beam. Beamforming requires the signals to be highly coherent between the receivers. Diversity combining combats ISI as well as signal fading by taking advantage of the independent information in the signal. Classical (spatial) diversity requires that signals are independently fading, hence are (spatially) uncorrelated with each other. In the real world, the received signals are neither totally coherent nor totally uncorrelated. The available diversity is complex and not well understood. In this paper, we study the spatial processing gain (SPG) as a function of the number of receivers used, receiver separation, and array aperture based on experimental data, using beamforming and multichannel combining algorithms. We find that the output symbol signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a multichannel equalizer is predominantly determined by the array aperture divided by the signal coherence length, with a negligible dependence on the number of receivers used. For a given number of receivers, an optimal output symbol SNR (OSNR) is achieved by spacing the receivers equal to or greater than the signal coherence length. We model the SPG in decibels as the sum of the noise suppression gain (NSG, equivalent to signal-to-noise enhancement) and the ISI suppression gain (ISG, equivalent to signal-to-ISI enhancement) both expressed in decibels; the latter exploits the spatial diversity and forms the basis for the diversity gain. Data are interpreted using the modeled result as a guide. We discuss a beam-domain processor for sonar arrays, which yields an improved performance at low-input SNR compared to the element-domain processor because of the SNR enhancement from beamforming many sensors.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2007.897072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4443156/04443177.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2007.897072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Spatial Processing Gain in Underwater Acoustic Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443177/","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Spatial Processing Gain in Underwater Acoustic Communications","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9743406","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4443177/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Spatial Processing Gain in Underwater Acoustic Communications","sourcePdf":"32joe03-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077843S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4443156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4443156","articleId":"4443177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4443181,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jun Bae","affiliation":["DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4443178/4443181/4443181-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Jun Bae received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSETCH), Kyungbuk, Korea, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","He joined Samsung Electronics, Hwasung, Korea, in 2005, where he has been involved in the design of high-bandwidth DRAM and the standardization of next generation Graphic DRAM.

It employs a data bus inversion (DBI) coding to overcome the bottleneck of a parallel single-ended signaling, a power consumption of I/O, power supply noise, and crosstalk. Both DBI AC and DC modes are combined to a single circuit by eliminating the feedback path of a conventional DBI AC circuit while achieving high-speed operation. The proposed DBI circuit uses an analog majority voter insensitive to mismatch for small area and delay.

As early as 1991, as a pioneer, he invented and initiated research and development of circuits to reduce the subthreshold current of MOSFETs, a key issue today in low-voltage CMOS LSI designs. A distinctive circuit that he and his team invented and developed was the gate-source self-reverse biasing circuit, which was initially applied to the word-driver block in DRAM. He also pioneered the charge-recycling scheme; it is now widely recognized to be applicable to various logic circuits. His team's recent development is the back-gate-controlled thin BOX FD-SOI SRAM technology, a strong candidate for next-generation CMOS technology that results in reduced variation and dynamic control of the threshold voltage.

It adopts the pre fitting verification algorithm (PREVA) to obtain the fast and accurate gain fitting and verification in two steps, coarse and fine gain fittings. The ear canal modeling filter circuit (EMC) which models the human external ear into the distributed LC filter enables the coarse gain fitting based on the shape of the external ear of the patient. The fine fitting verification is performed by the external inputs from the hearing loss test results. To reduce the power consumption of the human factored hearing aid chip design, the multi-threshold preamplifier, the adaptive fitting digital signal processor (DSP) with the filter reuse technique and the gated successive approximation ADC are designed and embedded to the digital hearing aid chip.

Passive resistances are introduced to the read assist circuit with replica memory transistors to lower the wordline voltage accurately reflecting the process and temperature variations. For the sake of not only enlarging the write margin but also reducing power consumption and speed overhead, the divided dynamic power-line scheme based on a charge sharing is adopted. Test chips of 512-Kb SRAM macros and isolated memory cell TEGs are fabricated using 45-nm bulk CMOS technology. Two types of 6-T SRAM cells, whose sizes were 0.245 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 0.327 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n were designed and evaluated. From the measurement results, we achieved over 100-mV improvement for static noise margin, and 35 mV for write margin for both SRAM cells at 1.0-V worst condition by using assist circuitry. It enables the wordline level to keep higher voltage at the slowest condition than the typical process condition, which results in 83% improvement of the cell current compared with the conventional assist circuit. Furthermore, the minimum operating voltage in the worst case condition was improved by 170 mV, confirming a high immunity against process and temperature variations with less than 10% area overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443200/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4443200/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9757292","volume":"43","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 45-nm Bulk CMOS Embedded SRAM With Improved Immunity Against Process and Temperature Variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 45-nm Bulk CMOS Embedded SRAM With Improved Immunity Against Process and Temperature Variations","sourcePdf":"43jssc01-nii.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164363S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4443178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4443178","articleId":"4443200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4443204,"authors":[{"name":"Shigeki Ohbayashi","affiliation":["Advanced Design Framework Development Department, Renesas Technology Corporation, Itami, Hyogo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4443178/4443204/4443204-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shigeki Ohbayashi was born in Hiroshima, Japan, on November 5, 1962.

We fabricated a 16 Mb SRAM with these techniques using 65 nm LSTP technology, and confirmed the efficient operations of these techniques. The WLBI mode enables simultaneous write operation for 6T-SRAM, and has no area penalty and a speed penalty of only 50 ps. The leak-bit redundancy for 6T-SRAM can reduce the infant mortality of the bare die, and improves the standby current distribution. The area penalty is less than 2%. The Cu E-trim fuse can be used beyond the 45 nm advanced process technology. The fuse requires no additional wafer process steps. Using only 1.2 V core transistors will allow CMOS technology scaling to enable fuse circuit size reduction. The trimming transistor is placed under the fuse due to there being no cracking around the trimmed position. We achieve the small fuse circuit size of 6 x 36 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n using 65 nm technology.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.908004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4443178/04443204.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.908004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 65 nm Embedded SRAM With Wafer Level Burn-In Mode, Leak-Bit Redundancy and Cu E-Trim Fuse for Known Good Die","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443204/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A 65 nm Embedded SRAM With Wafer Level Burn-In Mode, Leak-Bit Redundancy and Cu E-Trim Fuse for Known Good Die","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9743403","htmlLink":"/document/4443204/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 65 nm Embedded SRAM With Wafer Level Burn-In Mode, Leak-Bit Redundancy and Cu E-Trim Fuse for Known Good Die","sourcePdf":"43jssc01-obayashi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150998S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4443178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4443178","articleId":"4443204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4443205,"authors":[{"name":"Juergen Pille","affiliation":["IBM Entwicklung GmbH, Boeblingen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4443178/4443205/4443205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juergen Pille received the M.S. degree in microelectronics from the University of Hanover, Hanover, Germany, in 1990.","He joined IBM at the IBM Development Laboratory, Boeblingen, Germany, in 1990 to work on Advanced VLSI designs.

Hence, energy constrained applications, where performance requirements are secondary, benefit significantly from an SRAM that offers read and write functionality at the lowest possible voltage. However, bit-cells and architectures achieving very high density conventionally fail to operate at low voltages. This paper describes a high density SRAM in 65 nm CMOS that uses an 8T bit-cell to achieve a minimum operating voltage of 350 mV. Buffered read is used to ensure read stability, and peripheral control of both the bit-cell supply voltage and the read-buffer's foot voltage enable sub-T4 write and read without degrading the bit-cell's density. The plaguing area-offset tradeoff in modern sense-amplifiers is alleviated using redundancy, which reduces read errors by a factor of five compared to device up-sizing. At its lowest operating voltage, the entire 256 kb SRAM consumes 2.2 muW in leakage power.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.908005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4443178/04443213.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.908005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 256 kb 65 nm 8T Subthreshold SRAM Employing Sense-Amplifier Redundancy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A 256 kb 65 nm 8T Subthreshold SRAM Employing Sense-Amplifier Redundancy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443213/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9757301","volume":"43","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 256 kb 65 nm 8T Subthreshold SRAM Employing Sense-Amplifier Redundancy","sourcePdf":"43jssc01-verma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041109S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","isNumber":"4443178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"322","articleId":"4443213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4443214,"authors":[{"name":"Corrado Villa","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4443178/4443214/4443214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Corrado Villa was born in Monza, Italy, in 1961.

Firstly GM(1,1) has been improved with the difference scheme and made use of the parameter lambda to correct the background value; secondly the parameter b has been used to correct the initial value; lastly because of the nonlinear traits between the parameters lambda , b and the prediction errors, particle swarm optimization(PSO) has been used to solve the best value of lambda, b according to the criterion of minimizing the absolute value of mean relative error, then a new PSO-GM(1,1, lambda, b ) optimization model has been constructed. The correction deduction and PSO calculation lambda , b show that the prediction accuracy of the PSO-GM (1,1, lambda, b) is much higher than that of the GM (1, 1).

While Traditional GM (1, 1) forecasting model is not accurate and the value of parameter OC is constant, the proposed algorithm could overcome these disadvantages. In order to construct optimal grey model GM (1,1) to enhance the accuracy of forecasting, the improved decimal-code genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to search the optimal OC value of grey model GM (1, 1).

Its shortcomings are the loss of sparseness and robustness. Thus it usually results in slow testing speed and poor generalization performance. In this paper, a least squares support vector machine with linear programming formulation (LS-SVM-LP) is proposed to deal with above shortcomings. This method is equivalent to solve a linear equation set with deficient rank just like the over complete problem in independent component analysis (ICA). A minimum of 1-norm based object function is chosen to get the sparse and robust solution based on the idea of basis pursuit (BP) in the whole feasible region. Some UCI datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.

This paper addresses the problem of tool path integration in the context of spray-forming processes. Tool paths for geometry-complicated parts are generated by partitioning them into individual freeform surfaces, generating the paths for each partition, and then, finally, interconnecting the paths from the different patches so as to minimize the overall path length. We model the problem as a variant of the rural postman problem (RPP), which we call open-RPP. In this paper, we present two different solutions to the open-RPP. The first solution is based on genetic algorithms and the second one is based on ant colony optimization. This paper presents and compares the results from both methods on sample data and on real-world automotive body parts. We conclude this paper with remarks about the effectiveness of our implementations and the pros and cons of each method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443568/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9913748","volume":"38","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4443568/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robot Path Integration in Manufacturing Processes: Genetic Algorithm Versus Ant Colony Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot Path Integration in Manufacturing Processes: Genetic Algorithm Versus Ant Colony Optimization","sourcePdf":"38tsmca02-tewolde.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086478S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4459763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4459763","articleId":"4443568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4443580,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Lung Huang","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Wen-Lung Huang","id":"37710346900"},{"name":"Zeying Ren","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Zeying Ren","id":"37275473700"},{"name":"Yu-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Yu-Wei Lin","id":"37279529600"},{"name":"Hsien-Yeh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Hsien-Yeh Chen","id":"37836409600"},{"name":"Joerg Lahann","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Lahann","id":"37829098800"},{"name":"Clark T.-C.

The microvalve is normally open, and is fabricated and assembled primarily with stereolithographically fabricated polymer components. An incompressible elastomer is used as a solid hydraulic medium to convert the small axial displacement of a piezoelectric actuator into a large valve head stroke while maintaining a large blocking force. Also, the axial design of the microvalve enables densely-packed valve arrays. One application of this microvalve is in pneumatic tactile displays, some of which require operation against gas pressures up to approximately 90 kPa and switching speeds between 1-200 Hz. The current valve design has a maximum static hydraulic amplification ratio of 5 at 30 V driving voltage and a maximum valve head stroke of 37 mum at 150 V. Under a 94.4 kPa differential pressure, the flow rate of the valve and the closing voltage measure 785 mL/min and 150 V, respectively. In addition, the function of the microvalve as an on-off switch for a pneumatic microbubble tactile actuator is demonstrated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polymers","Microvalves","Solids","Valves","Voltage","Switches","Assembly","Piezoelectric actuators","Displays","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bubbles","display devices","flow control","fluidic devices","hydraulic control equipment","microfluidics","microvalves","piezoelectric actuators","pneumatic actuators","polymers","pressure control","stereolithography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectrically-driven microvalve","hydraulically-amplified axial polymer microvalve","stereolithography","incompressible elastomer","solid hydraulic medium","piezoelectric actuator displacement","microvalve design","pneumatic tactile displays","static hydraulic amplification ratio","pneumatic microbubble tactile actuator","voltage 30 V","voltage 150 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443708","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 21st International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 21st International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4443569/4443570/04443708.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A piezoelectrically-driven high flow rate axial polymer microvalve with solid hydraulic amplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A piezoelectrically-driven high flow rate axial polymer microvalve with solid hydraulic amplification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443708/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4443708/","accessionNumber":"9829552","conferenceDate":"13-17 Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Jan. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A piezoelectrically-driven high flow rate axial polymer microvalve with solid hydraulic amplification","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212008-00138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051958S","chronDate":"13-17 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4443569","isNumber":"4443570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4443569","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4443570","articleId":"4443708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4443726,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A proper coordination among the onload tap changer (OLTC), substation switched capacitors and feeder-switched capacitors in order to obtain optimum voltage and reactive power control is proposed. It is assumed that there is no communication link between the OLTC and the capacitors, a normal case in distribution system operation these days. The results indicate that the proposed method decreases the number of OLTC operations, losses, and voltage fluctuations in distribution systems, with and without DG present. The power-flow reversal due to the DG is shown not to interfere with the effectiveness of the OLTC operation. Further, it is also shown that as long as the available capacitors are enough to compensate the reactive power demand, the DG operation mode does not give a significant effect to the distribution system losses. However, DG operating at a constant voltage is beneficial for a significant reduction of OLTC operation and voltage fluctuation in the distribution system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.915870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4476461/04443852.pdf","endPage":"1087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage and Reactive Power Control in Systems With Synchronous Machine-Based Distributed Generation","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.915870","startPage":"1079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Voltage and Reactive Power Control in Systems With Synchronous Machine-Based Distributed Generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443852/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920770","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4443852/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage and Reactive Power Control in Systems With Synchronous Machine-Based Distributed Generation","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd02-viawan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054057S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4476461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"4476461","articleId":"4443852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4443854,"authors":[{"name":"Jinde Cao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4468809/4443854/4443854-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinde Cao (M'07\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in mathematics/applied mathematics from Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China, in 1986, the M.S. degree in mathematics/applied mathematics from Yunnan University, Kunming, China, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics/applied mathematics from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 1998.","From March 1989 to May 2000, he was with Yunnan University.

Unlike most ML methods, the proposed algorithm takes into account both spatial and temporal information, optimization is performed using the expectation-maximization (EM) method, the source model is adapted to maximize the likelihood, and the update equations have a simple, analytical form. The proposed method, which we refer to as autoregressive mixture of Gaussians (AR-MOG), outperforms nine other methods for artificial mixtures of real audio.

Decentralized observer independent of the time delays is first designed. Then, we employ the bounds information of uncertain interconnections to construct the decentralized output feedback controller via backstepping design method. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, we show that the designed controller can render the closed-loop system asymptotically stable with the help of the changing supplying function idea. Furthermore, the corresponding decentralized control problem is considered under the case that the bounds of uncertain interconnections are not precisely known. By employing the neural network approximation theory, we construct the neural network output feedback controller with corresponding adaptive law. The resulting closed-loop system is stable in the sense of semiglobal boundedness. The observers and controllers constructed in this paper are independent of the time delays.

The core problem is a multicast generalization of the multiuser downlink beamforming problem; the difference is that each transmitted stream is directed to multiple receivers, each with its own channel. Such generalization is relevant and timely, e.g., in the context of the emerging WiMAX and UMTS-LTE wireless networks. The joint problem also contains single-group multicast beamforming as a special case. The latter (and therefore also the former) is NP-hard. This motivates the pursuit of computationally efficient quasi-optimal solutions. It is shown that Lagrangian relaxation coupled with suitable randomization/cochannel multicast power control yield computationally efficient high-quality approximate solutions. For a significant fraction of problem instances, the solutions generated this way are exactly optimal. Extensive numerical results using both simulated and measured wireless channels are presented to corroborate our main findings.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.909010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4451275/04443878.pdf","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.909010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of Service and Max-Min Fair Transmit Beamforming to Multiple Cochannel Multicast Groups","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Service and Max-Min Fair Transmit Beamforming to Multiple Cochannel Multicast Groups","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443878/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9920596","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4443878/","volume":"56","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of Service and Max-Min Fair Transmit Beamforming to Multiple Cochannel Multicast Groups","sourcePdf":"56tsp03-karipidis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08758S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4451275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"392","xplore-issue":"4451275","articleId":"4443878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4443879,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel D.

Unfortunately, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the observed signals currently inhibits the widespread use of the technique, thus highlighting the need for intelligent processing algorithms. In earlier work, we proposed a set of maximum likelihood-based algorithms enabling detection of even very weak NQR signals. These algorithms are based on derived realistic NQR data models, assuming that the (complex) amplitudes of the NQR signal components are known to within a multiplicative constant. However, these amplitudes, which are obtained from experimental measurements, are typically prone to some level of uncertainty. For such cases, these algorithms will experience a loss in performance. Herein, we develop a set of robust algorithms, allowing for uncertainties in the assumed amplitudes, showing that these offer a significant performance gain over the current state-of-the art techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4443879/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920608","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance Signal Detection Allowing for Amplitude Uncertainties","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance Signal Detection Allowing for Amplitude Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"56tsp03-somasundaram.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072396S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4451275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4451275","articleId":"4443879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4443887,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Gillet","affiliation":["GET/T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris/CNRS LTCI, Paris, France","Google, Inc., Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4451143/4443887/4443887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olivier Gillet (A'07) received the State Engineering degree from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ENST), Paris, France, in 2003, the M.Sc.

A complete drum transcription system is described, which combines information from the original music signal and a drum track enhanced version obtained by source separation. In addition to efficient fusion strategies to take into account these two complementary sources of information, the transcription system integrates a large set of features, optimally selected by feature selection. Concurrently, the problem of drum track extraction from polyphonic music is tackled both by proposing a novel approach based on harmonic/noise decomposition and time/frequency masking and by improving an existing Wiener filtering-based separation method. The separation and transcription techniques presented are thoroughly evaluated on a large public database of music signals. A transcription accuracy between 64.5% and 80.3% is obtained, depending on the drum instrument, for well-balanced mixes, and the efficiency of our drum separation algorithms is illustrated in a comprehensive benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.914120","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4451143/04443887.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.914120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"529","endPage":"540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transcription and Separation of Drum Signals From Polyphonic Music","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transcription and Separation of Drum Signals From Polyphonic Music","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443887/","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4443887/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9870019","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transcription and Separation of Drum Signals From Polyphonic Music","sourcePdf":"16tasl03-gillet-x.pdf.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115068S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4451143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4451143","articleId":"4443887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4443893,"authors":[{"name":"Florent Chatelain","affiliation":["IRIT/ENSEEIHT/T\u00e9SA, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4451160/4443893/4443893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Florent Chatelain received the Eng. degree in computer sciences and applied mathematics from ENSIMAG, Grenoble, France, and the M.

These circuits have a limitation: high pulse currents will occur at the switching transients, which will reduce the efficiency and cause electromagnetic interference problems. This makes it difficult to use this technology in high-power-level conversion. This paper presents a new design method for dc-dc converter with switched-capacitorldquo technology. The new method can reduce the high pulse current which usually causes serious problem in traditional converters. Therefore, the power level of this new designed converter can be extended to 1 kW or even higher. A 1-kW 42/14-V switched-capacitor converter was designed for 42-V automotive system. The proposed converter has no requirement for magnetic components and can achieve a peak efficiency of 98% and 96 % at full load. The main circuit of the dc-dc converter is analyzed and its control scheme is presented in the paper. The experimental results verified the analysis and demonstrate the advantages.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.915043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4463842/04443901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.915043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463842","startPage":"832","endPage":"840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Design Method for High-Power High-Efficiency Switched-Capacitor DC\u2013DC Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Design Method for High-Power High-Efficiency Switched-Capacitor DC\u2013DC Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918596","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4443901/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Design Method for High-Power High-Efficiency Switched-Capacitor DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"23tpel02-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073729S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4463842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"4463842","articleId":"4443901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4443913,"authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Fukuda","affiliation":["Integrated Research Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37289100600"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Ito","affiliation":["Precision and Intelligence Laboratory, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Ito","id":"37279184000"},{"name":"Kazuhisa Itoi","affiliation":["Electron Device Laboratory, Fujikura Limited, Sakura, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhisa","lastName":"Itoi","id":"37283728900"},{"name":"Masakazu Sato","affiliation":["Electron Device Laboratory, Fujikura Limited, Sakura, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakazu","lastName":"Sato","id":"37276053400"},{"name":"Tatsuya Ito","affiliation":["Electron Device Laboratory, Fujikura Limited, Sakura, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Ito","id":"37275231500"},{"name":"Ryozo Yamauchi","affiliation":["Fujikura Limited, Koto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryozo","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37342489200"},{"name":"Kenichi Okada","affiliation":["Integrated Research Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Okada","id":"37280639100"},{"name":"Kazuya Masu","affiliation":["Integrated Research Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Masu","id":"37267209200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1307-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1308-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4443913","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443913","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Inductors","Chip scale packaging","Wafer scale integration","Radio frequency","Dielectric substrates","CMOS technology","Q factor","Resins","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","inductors","integrated circuit packaging","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS low noise amplifier","wafer-level chip-scale package","Q-factor","noise figure","on-chip inductors","LNA","frequency 5.2 GHz","noise figure 1.7 dB"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low noise amplifier (LNA) with high-Q inductors in a wafer-level chip-scale package (WL-CSP) process.

One of the applications of this spectrum is for short range communication systems. These systems are designed to deliver gigabit speeds, consuming small amount of power in small form factor. The small factor is achieved because passive components scale with carrier frequency and at 60GHz components such as: transmit receive filters, passives and antennas are candidates for inclusion on the die. Integrating RF, mixed signal and digital components is another important step towards reducing system cost and form factor. In order to achieve low cost and high digital integration CMOS is the process of choice. Unfortunately compared to other much more expensive processes such as SiGe and GaAs, CMOS has greater process variability, lower carrier mobility constants, and smaller device breakdown voltages all of which make millimeter wave RF design particularly challenging. In this paper we outline the issues in the implementation of a Gigabit per second 60GHz Transceiver-on-Chip using CMOS.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIT.2007.4443937","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4443903/4443904/04443937.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","doi":"10.1109/RFIT.2007.4443937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Issues in the Implementation of a 60GHz Transceiver on CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Issues in the Implementation of a 60GHz Transceiver on CMOS","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4443937/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9766058","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443937/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Issues in the Implementation of a 60GHz Transceiver on CMOS","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RFIT-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057394S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4443903","isNumber":"4443904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4443903","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4443904","articleId":"4443937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4443938,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.

Several fundamental building blocks benefit from the availability of high-Q resonators in the RF front-end and the frequency synthesizer to lower power consumption, phase noise and die area. In addition, the compatibility of MEMS with CMOS opens the door to a higher integration level using for example an above-Q approach. This paper presents the recent work made at CSEM in the field of low-power transceiver for wireless sensor network applications. It first presents the high-Q resonators, including the BAW resonators used in the RF front-end and in the RF oscillator together with MEMS used in the low frequency reference oscillators. These MEMS are activated thanks to an AlN piezo layer avoiding the need for high voltage generation which is incompatible with the low-power and low-voltage requirement. These MEMS are also temperature compensated by the combination of additional layers and electronics means. The paper then focuses on the main building blocks that can take advantage of high-Q resonators. The fundamentals of oscillators built around high-Q devices is described, highlighting the basic trade-offs. It is also described how to take advantage of such devices within a receiver front-end.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4443903/4443904/04443941.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"167","doi":"10.1109/RFIT.2007.4443941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIT.2007.4443941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building Blocks for an Ultra Low-Power MEMS-based Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Building Blocks for an Ultra Low-Power MEMS-based Radio","htmlLink":"/document/4443941/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9766062","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building Blocks for an Ultra Low-Power MEMS-based Radio","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RFIT-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079044S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4443903","isNumber":"4443904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4443903","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4443904","articleId":"4443941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4443953,"authors":[{"name":"Georg Boeck","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin University of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Boeck","id":"37282337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1307-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1308-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4443953","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","CMOS technology","Radio frequency","Circuit noise","Low-noise amplifiers","Silicon","Energy consumption","Integrated circuit technology","Microwave technology","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","CMOS digital integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","mobile communication","radiofrequency integrated circuits","system-on-chip","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF-CMOS integrated circuits","wireless communications","digital mobile broadband communication systems","single chip integration","RF-transceiver","SoC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF CMOS","transceiver","low noise amplifier","mixer","voltage controlled oscillator","power amplifier","wireless communications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443953","abstract":"The emergence of digital mobile broadband communication systems for voice, data, multimedia and positioning is coupled to the continuous progress of silicon CMOS-technology.

The simulation results verify the practicability of ICSA approaches that the probability that PAPR exceeds 5.5 dB is about 1/10 of that of the HNN approach.

In this paper both topologies are compared and benefits and drawbacks of the different structures are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4443983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4443983/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9766103","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power amplifiers in 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS for DECT: a comparison between two different architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power amplifiers in 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS for DECT: a comparison between two different architectures","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RFIT-00-79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040655S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4443903","isNumber":"4443904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4443903","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4443904","articleId":"4443983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4443984,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqun Li","affiliation":["Institute of RF-& OE-ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqun","lastName":"Li","id":"37537160400"},{"name":"Feng Guo","affiliation":["Institute of RF-& OE-ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37823745000"},{"name":"Dongdong Chen","affiliation":["Institute of RF-& OE-ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dongdong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37829503500"},{"name":"Haisong Li","affiliation":["Institute of RF-& OE-ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haisong","lastName":"Li","id":"37697187800"},{"name":"Zhigong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of RF-& OE-ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhigong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279247800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1307-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1308-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4443984","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Gain control","Radio frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Voltage control","Noise figure","Wideband","Circuit topology","Control systems","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","UHF amplifiers","VHF amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband CMOS variable gain amplifier","linear-in-dB gain control","RF CMOS process","frequency 430 MHz to 2330 MHz","size 0.18 mum","power 16.2 mW","voltage 1.8 V","noise figure 6.2 dB","gain -3.3 dB to 9.5 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VGA","wideband","linear-in-dB","CMOS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4443984","doi":"10.1109/RFIT.2007.4443984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIT.2007.4443984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443904","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4443903/4443904/04443984.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wideband CMOS Variable Gain Amplifier with a Novel Linear-in-dB Gain Control Structure","abstract":"In this paper, a novel structure of linear-in-dB gain control is introduced.

The latest security protocol, the IEEE 802.11i assures rigid security for WLANs with the support of IEEE 802.1x protocol for authentication, authorization and key distribution. Nevertheless, fresh security threats are emerging often to oust these new defense mechanisms. Further, many organizations based on superficial vendor literature, believe their wireless security is sufficient enough to prevent any unauthorized access. Having wide ranging options for security configurations, users are camouflaged into deep uncertainty. This volatile state of affairs has prevented many organizations from fully deploying WLANs for their secure communication needs, though WLANs may be cost effective and flexible. In this paper, we present an anomaly based mechanism to detect both known and emerging security threats in WLANs. Our method uses both timing and behavioral anomalies. We first look for timing and/or behavior anomalies during the security association process and then use outlier based data association approaches to verify their legitimacy. The proposed concept was tested on our experimental setup and the results obtained from EAP-LEAP and EAP-PEAP authenticated hosts are presented here.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2007.4444063","publicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444030/4444031/04444063.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2007.4444063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Security Threats in Wireless LANs Using Timing and Behavioral Anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444063/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Security Threats in Wireless LANs Using Timing and Behavioral Anomalies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808584","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4444063/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Security Threats in Wireless LANs Using Timing and Behavioral Anomalies","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"ICON07-00-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068818S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444030","isNumber":"4444031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444030","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4444031","articleId":"4444063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4444096,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Jaafar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Jaafar","id":"37392195900"},{"name":"Wessam Ajib","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Ajib","id":"37294527900"},{"name":"Sami Tabbane","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and networks, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Tabbane","id":"37282329300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1229-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1230-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-2216"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5798"}],"articleNumber":"4444096","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"abstract":"Data transmission in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) has a multi-hop nature where data is originated/destinated to one source/sink node. Therefore, the transmission capacity at the physical layer depends on multiple factors such as the network topology, the access policy, and the transmission configuration. When multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology is used at the physical layer of each node, the nodes that are geographically in the same transmission range, can transmit simultaneously. The different transmissions can be separated spatially using one of the decoding MIMO methods. In this paper, we investigate the per-node capacity in a WMN using MIMO links. We introduce the problem of the transmission configuration in WMNs, defined as the number of transmit antennas used at each node, and its effect on the network capacity. The goal of this study is to provide ideas for network architects about how to dimension wireless mesh networks in order to have an optimal capacity with minimal equipment requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444030/4444031/04444096.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2007.4444096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2007.4444096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444031","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Capacity of MIMO-based Wireless Mesh Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless mesh networks","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Ad hoc networks","Interference","Physical layer","Wireless networks","Computer science","Spread spectrum communication","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio links","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-based wireless mesh networks","data transmission","transmission capacity","network topology","access policy","transmission configuration","multiple input multiple output technology","transmission range","MIMO links"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Capacity of MIMO-based Wireless Mesh Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4444096/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808597","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Capacity of MIMO-based Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"ICON07-00-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111182S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444030","isNumber":"4444031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444030","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4444031","articleId":"4444096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444109,"authors":[{"name":"Masoomeh Torabzadeh","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masoomeh","lastName":"Torabzadeh","id":"37640490700"},{"name":"Yusheng Ji","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37287372900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1229-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1230-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-2216"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5798"}],"articleNumber":"4444109","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"abstract":"High performance, low complexity schedulers are challenging to develop for the downlink of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems. Selection among available channels between users and the base station in a centralized way makes the problem complex. An approach to solve this problem is combinatorial optimization algorithms. In this case, the scheduling can be done in two different phases. The first phase is the user selection in which the scheduler selects a group of users based on its own criterion. The assignment scheme assigns the selected users to the transmit antennas, taking into consideration the capacity maximization in the second phase of the scheduling. Considerations related to user satisfaction, fairness, physical layer parameters, and/or traffic arrival processes in this kind of scheduler can be implemented with low complexity. For the second phase, we propose a near-optimal, low-complexity, assignment scheme, called the max difference of top two (MDTT). An intensive simulation study taking into account the mobility of users shows the superior performance of our assignment scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444030/4444031/04444109.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"341","publicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2007.4444109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2007.4444109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444031","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Near Optimal Antenna Assignment for MIMO Systems with Low Complexity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Downlink","Round robin","Base stations","Physical layer","Traffic control","Fading","Throughput","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computational complexity","MIMO communication","optimisation","scheduling","telecommunication links","telecommunication traffic","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near optimal antenna assignment","MIMO system","low complexity","multiple-input multiple-output cellular system","combinatorial optimization algorithm","scheduling","capacity maximization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Near Optimal Antenna Assignment for MIMO Systems with Low Complexity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4444109/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808586","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Near Optimal Antenna Assignment for MIMO Systems with Low Complexity","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"ICON07-00-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060451S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444030","isNumber":"4444031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444030","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4444031","articleId":"4444109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4444110,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf S.

The characterization takes into account the RF propagation model, the shadowing process and considers both intracell and intercell interference. To arrive at the model, the paper utilizes approximation techniques recently developed in the recent literature to evaluate the sum of lognormal random variables. The overall traffic power is modeled as a random variable that is function of the network parameters and the assigned downlink bit rates. The paper demonstrates the calculation of the forward link power outage probability as one example application for the developed characterization. It also compares between two approximation techniques suggested in this paper: matched first and second order statistics, and the min-max technique. The analytical results are compared to those obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations to assess the accuracy of the adapted approximations. The results indicate the min-max technique produces more accurate results when compared to matched first and second moments approximation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2007.4444110","publicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444030/4444031/04444110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2007.4444110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444031","startPage":"342","endPage":"347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation Techniques For Analytical Characterization Of Downlink Traffic Power For Multi-Service CDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximation Techniques For Analytical Characterization Of Downlink Traffic Power For Multi-Service CDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444110/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808589","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4444110/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation Techniques For Analytical Characterization Of Downlink Traffic Power For Multi-Service CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"ICON07-00-79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059153S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444030","isNumber":"4444031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444030","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4444031","articleId":"4444110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4444214,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbo Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Hongbo Liu","id":"37087258388"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Centre for Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37297713700"},{"name":"Crina Grosan","affiliation":["Centre for Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Crina","lastName":"Grosan","id":"37282607100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1475-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1476-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4444214","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Processor scheduling","Job shop scheduling","Large-scale systems","Humans","Scheduling algorithm","Genetic algorithms","Computer science","Quality of service","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["job shop scheduling","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable neighborhood particle swarm optimization","multiobjective flexible job-shop scheduling problems","hybrid metaheuristic","variable neighborhood search"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444214","abstract":"This paper introduces a hybrid metaheuristic, the Variable Neighborhood Particle Swarm Optimization (VNPSO), consisting of a combination of the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

The algorithm comparison is made using the average relative error obtained in the signals\u2019 demodulation process, their noise sensitivity, and computational efficiency. The obtained results showed that the HTM method produces the least fi estimation errors in noisy signals, and depending on the kind of signal considered, DESA1 and HTM methods produce the least ai estimation errors.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-LA.2007.4444526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/9907/4444525/04444526.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/T-LA.2007.4444526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of the non linear energy operator and the Hilbert transform in the estimation of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the non linear energy operator and the Hilbert transform in the estimation of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the non linear energy operator and the Hilbert transform in the estimation of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency","sourcePdf":"5TLA1_01Diaz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034988S","chronDate":"March  2007","isNumber":"4444525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4444526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4444549,"authors":[{"name":"Weisheng Dong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37396032700"},{"name":"Guangming Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Shi","id":"37267099300"},{"name":"Jizheng Xu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jizheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37279201100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4444549","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Adaptive filters","Discrete wavelet transforms","Filtering","Discrete transforms","Decoding","Rate-distortion","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","data compression","image coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive nonseparable interpolation","image compression","directional wavelet transform","conventional interpolation filter","adaptive filter","JPEG 2000","test images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive directional lifting","adaptive 2-D interpolation filter","rate-distortion optimization"]}],"abstract":"The adaptive directional lifting-based wavelet transform (ADL) locally adapts the filtering directions to the local properties of the image. In this letter, instead of using the conventional interpolation filter for the directional prediction with fractional-pel accuracy, a new two-dimensional nonseparable adaptive interpolation filter is proposed. The adaptive filter is calculated for every fractional-pel direction so as to minimize the energy of the prediction error. The tradeoff between reducing the prediction error and the overhead to code the interpolation filter is discussed. This enables coding gains of up to 0.98 dB, compared to ADL coder, and up to 2.4 dB, compared to the JPEG 2000 for typical test images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Nonseparable Interpolation for Image Compression With Directional Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.914929","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04444549.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.914929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Nonseparable Interpolation for Image Compression With Directional Wavelet Transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/4444549/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"9920170","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Nonseparable Interpolation for Image Compression With Directional Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-dong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081189S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4444549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4444551,"authors":[{"name":"Damien Letexier","affiliation":["Fresnel Institut, Ecole Centrale Marseille, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Letexier","id":"37830391800"},{"name":"Salah Bourennane","affiliation":["Fresnel Institut, Ecole Centrale Marseille, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Salah","lastName":"Bourennane","id":"37285089400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4444551","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Whereas most previous works treating color or hyper- spectral image restoration use hybrid filters or data splitting, some new approaches consider multidimensional or tensor signal processing techniques. Tensor processing methods are based on multilinear algebra and are more efficient than 2-D filtering. However, they rely on orthogonal tensor flattening. The aim of this letter is to show that this orthogonal flattening may not be optimal for multidimensional images. We propose a method to adapt the flattening depending on the data set. Our proposed method is based on the estimation of main directions in multidimensional data. For this purpose, we extend the straight line detection algorithm. Multidimensional filtering method HOSVD - (K1,..., K\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</sub>\n) is applied along the estimated directions. We also adapt a quadtree partitioning in order to split tensors into homogeneous sub-tensors to keep local characteristics.

Regulated high voltage generation at low supply voltage is achieved with optimized oscillator, high-voltage charge pump, and voltage regulator circuits. We developed a design methodology for a high-voltage charge pump to minimize silicon area, noise, and power consumption of the circuit without degrading the high-voltage output drive capability. Novel circuit techniques are proposed for low supply voltage operation. Both the oscillator and the regulator circuits achieve 1.5 V operation, while the regulator includes a ripple suppression circuit that is simple and robust. Through the paper, theoretical analysis of the proposed circuits is provided along with Spice simulations. A mobile NAND Flash device is realized with an advanced 63 nm technology to verify the operation of the proposed circuits. Extensive measurements show agreement with the results predicted by both analysis and simulation.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.914327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4444554/04444566.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.914327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Voltage Analog System for a Mobile NAND Flash","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"High-Voltage Analog System for a Mobile NAND Flash","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4444566/","accessionNumber":"9748365","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Voltage Analog System for a Mobile NAND Flash","sourcePdf":"43jssc02-kang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137473S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4444554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4444554","articleId":"4444566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4444567,"authors":[{"name":"Keejong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","Department of Central Engineering, Broadcom Corporation, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4444554/4444567/4444567-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keejong Kim received the B.S. degree with honors in electronics engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 1990.

Reducing voltage swing of the bit-line is an effective way to save the power dissipation in write cycles. Voltage swing reduction of bit-lines is, however, limited due to possible write-failures. We propose a new low-power SRAM using bit-line charge recycling (CR-SRAM) for the write operation. In the proposed write scheme, differential voltage swing of a bit-line is obtained by recycled charge from its adjacent bit-line capacitance, instead of the power line. Applying such a charge recycling technique to the bit-line significantly reduces write power. A test chip with 32 Kbits (256 rows x 128 columns) is fabricated and measured in 0.13 mum CMOS to demonstrate operation of the proposed SRAM. Measurement results show 88% reduction in total power during write cycles compared to the conventional SRAM (CON-SRAM) at V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n = 1.5 V and f = 100 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.914294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4444554/04444567.pdf","startPage":"446","endPage":"459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.914294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Power SRAM Using Bit-Line Charge-Recycling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444567/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Power SRAM Using Bit-Line Charge-Recycling","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748366","htmlLink":"/document/4444567/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Power SRAM Using Bit-Line Charge-Recycling","sourcePdf":"43jssc02-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073868S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4444554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4444554","articleId":"4444567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4444568,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Hyoung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4444554/4444568/4444568-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tae-Hyoung Kim (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.","In 2001, he joined the Device Solution Network Division, Samsung Electronics, Yong-in, Korea. from 2001 to 2005, he performed research on the design of high-speed SRAM memories.

Techniques for efficient behavior of both the amplitude (AM) and phase (PM) path are introduced. The amplitude modulation technique is based on asynchronous pulse-width modulation of a phase-modulated RF signal. The digital signal generated in this way is suited for amplification using a nonlinear, efficient type of PA, while preserving the AM modulation, since this information is present in the signal. The efficiency of the switching amplifier is less dependent of the output power, compared to class B operation. Using a self-oscillating, asynchronous type of pulse-width modulator, the spurs are concentrated in narrow bands well separated from the signal band. These switching spurs are filtered out by the filters already present in the transmitter. The feasibility of this RF-pulse-width-modulation is proven by measurements with amplitude modulated signals on a prototype in 0.18 mum CMOS. Unmodulated, the circuit is able to deliver a peak output power of 8.26 dBm with a drain efficiency of 35%. In the phase-modulation path of the polar modulator, injection locking of an oscillator is used as a single-stage high-gain amplifier. Avoiding multiple stages and related power loss improves the overall power efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","Amplitude modulation","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Space vector pulse width modulation","Phase modulation","Pulse modulation","Power generation","Injection-locked oscillators","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","amplitude modulation","CMOS integrated circuits","mixers (circuits)","modulators","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar modulator","self-oscillating amplifier","injection-locked upconversion mixer","amplitude modulation","asynchronous pulse-width modulation","CMOS","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["018 $\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$  CMOS","asynchronous pulsewidth modulation","digital transmitter","injection locking","polar modulation","SOPA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.914296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4444554/04444570.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.914296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Polar Modulator Using Self-Oscillating Amplifiers and an Injection-Locked Upconversion Mixer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Polar Modulator Using Self-Oscillating Amplifiers and an Injection-Locked Upconversion Mixer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444570/","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4444570/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9748369","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Polar Modulator Using Self-Oscillating Amplifiers and an Injection-Locked Upconversion Mixer","sourcePdf":"43jssc02-laflere.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06381S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4444554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4444554","articleId":"4444570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4444572,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Fu Liang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4444554/4444572/4444572-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Che-Fu Liang (S'04) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1981.

The designed modulator shows very high figure of merit among the state-of-the-art sub-l-V modulators.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4444554/04444579.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.914266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.914266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.9-V 60-- 1-Bit Fourth-Order Delta-Sigma Modulator With 83-dB Dynamic Range","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta modulation","Dynamic range","CMOS technology","Bandwidth","Sampling methods","Frequency","Voltage","Transconductance","Operational amplifiers","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","delta-sigma modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulator","CMOS technology","signal bandwidth","sampling frequency","input-feedforward architecture","voltage swing","low-power amplifier","modulator architecture","low-quiescent operational transconductance amplifier","switched capacitor circuit","voltage 0.9 V","power 60 muW","size 0.13 micron","bandwidth 20 kHz","frequency 2 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power","low voltage","operational transconductance amplifier","sigma-delta modulation","switched capacitator circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 0.9-V 60-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {W}}$</tex> </formula> 1-Bit Fourth-Order Delta-Sigma Modulator With 83-dB Dynamic Range","volume":"43","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4444579/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748378","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.9-V 60-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {W}}$</tex> </formula> 1-Bit Fourth-Order Delta-Sigma Modulator With 83-dB Dynamic Range","sourcePdf":"43jssc02-roh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073152S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4444554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"4444554","articleId":"4444579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444580,"authors":[{"name":"Guillermo Serrano","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Puerto\uc2a0Rico, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Serrano","id":"37270017200"},{"name":"Paul Hasler","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Hasler","id":"37270054200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"4444580","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2821},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Resistors","Temperature distribution","Voltage","Temperature dependence","MOSFETs","Prototypes","CMOS process","Oscillators","Phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","compensation","reference circuits","resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature compensation","negative temperature coefficient","CMOS current reference","on-chip poly resistor","MOS transistor","floating-gate transistors","size 0.5 mum","temperature 0 degC to 80 degC","voltage 2.3 V to 3.3 V","current 16 muA to 53 muA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Charge","current reference","floating gate","programmable","temperature coefficient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444580","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4444554/04444580.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.914336","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.914336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Precision Low-TC Wide-Range CMOS Current Reference","abstract":"This paper describes a programmable temperature-compensated CMOS current reference.

The temperature compensation is independent of the reference value; a low TC reference is possible for a wide range of currents.

However, this error measurement suffers from signal range reduction and long signal decorrelation time. A signal-dependent dithering scheme allows the injection of a large dither without sacrificing the signal range and shortens the signal decorrelation time. A 1.5-bit multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) stage is modified for signal-dependent dithering with two additional comparators, and its capacitor mismatch and gain errors are measured and calibrated as one error. When sampled at 20 MS/s, a 15-bit prototype ADC achieves a spurious-free dynamic range of 98 dB with 14.5-MHz input and a peak signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio of 73 dB with 1-MHz input.

It is theoretically and experimentally shown that the fault signatures caused by the inverter harmonics are similar and comparable to those generated by the fundamental harmonic on the line current. Theoretically-derived extended relations including bearing fault, eccentricity, and broken rotor bar relations are found to match experimental results. Furthermore, it is observed and reported that the asymmetries on the rotor caused by broken rotor bars increase the amplitude of even harmonics. To confirm these claims, bearing, eccentricity, and broken rotor bar faults are tested and the line current spectrum of each faulty motor is compared with the healthy one. The proposed additional fault data are expected to contribute positively to the inverter-fed motor fault decision making algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.911954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4444586/04444587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.911954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444586","startPage":"610","endPage":"619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Order PWM Inverter Harmonics Contributions to the Inverter-Fed Induction Machine Fault Diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Order PWM Inverter Harmonics Contributions to the Inverter-Fed Induction Machine Fault Diagnosis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748385","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4444587/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Order PWM Inverter Harmonics Contributions to the Inverter-Fed Induction Machine Fault Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"55tie02-akin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098574S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4444586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4444586","articleId":"4444587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444588,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Barut","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nigde University, Nigde, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4444586/4444588/4444588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Murat Barut (S'06) was born in Gaziantep, Turkey, in 1973.

The detection strategy is based on stator current analysis. Mechanical load faults generally lead to load torque oscillations at specific frequencies related to the mechanical rotor speed. The torque oscillations produce a characteristic sinusoidal phase modulation of the stator current. Speed transients result in time-varying supply frequencies that prevent the use of classical, Fourier transform-based spectral estimation. This paper proposes the use of a time-frequency distribution, the Wigner Distribution, for stator current analysis. Fault indicators are extracted from the distribution for on-line condition monitoring. The proposed methods are implemented on a low-cost digital signal processor. Experimental results in a steady-state and during transients with load torque oscillations and load imbalance are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Monitoring of Mechanical Faults in Variable-Speed Induction Motor Drives Using the Wigner Distribution","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.911941","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4444586/04444589.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.911941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444589/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"On-Line Monitoring of Mechanical Faults in Variable-Speed Induction Motor Drives Using the Wigner Distribution","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4444589/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748388","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Line Monitoring of Mechanical Faults in Variable-Speed Induction Motor Drives Using the Wigner Distribution","sourcePdf":"55tie02-blodt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070956S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4444586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"4444586","articleId":"4444589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444592,"authors":[{"name":"Luisa Coppola","affiliation":["Automation Department, ABB Corporate Research Center, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4444586/4444592/4444592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luisa Coppola (S'05\u2013A'06) was born in Dolo, Venice, Italy in 1978.

The method, however, does not always achieve good results when the speed or the load torque is not constant, because this causes variations on the motor-slip and fast Fourier transform problems appear due to a nonstationary signal. This paper proposes a new method for motor fault detection, which analyzes the spectrogram based on a short-time Fourier transform and a further combination of wavelet and power-spectral-density (PSD) techniques, which consume a smaller amount of processing power. The proposed algorithms have been applied to detect broken rotor bars as well as shorted turns.

The flux and torque error are geometrically combined in a new flux leakage vector to make a stator command voltage vector in a deadbeat manner. A new sensorless method of estimating the rotor speed, flux, stator resistance, and rotor resistance is derived and verified with experimental results. Common terms in the error dynamics are utilized to find a simpler error model involving some auxiliary variables. Using this error model, the state estimation problem is converted into a parameter estimation problem assuming the rotor speed is constant. The proposed adaptive schemes are determined so that the whole system is stable in the sense of Lyapunov.

Selection of reactive power as the functional candidate in the MRAC automatically makes the system immune to the variation of stator resistance. Moreover, the unique formation of the MRAC with the instantaneous and steady-state reactive power completely eliminates the requirement of any flux estimation in the process of computation. Thus, the method is less sensitive to integrator-related problems like drift and saturation (requiring no integration). This also makes the estimation at or near zero speed quite accurate. Adding flux estimators to the MRAC, a speed sensorless scheme is developed.

Normally, NNs are characterized as heavily parallel calculation algorithms that employ enormous computational resources and are less useful for economical digital hardware implementations. A stochastic NN structure is proposed in this paper for an FPGA implementation of a feedforward NN to estimate the feedback signals in an induction motor drive. The stochastic arithmetic simplifies the computational elements of the NN and significantly reduces the number of logic gates required for the proposed NN estimator. A new stochastic proportional-integral speed controller is also developed with antiwindup functionality. Compared with conventional digital controls for motor drives, the proposed stochastic-based algorithm enhances the arithmetic operations of the FPGA, saves digital resources, and permits the NN algorithms and classical control algorithms to be easily interfaced and implemented on a single low-complexity, inexpensive FPGA. The algorithm has been realized using a single FPGA XC3S400 from Xilinx, Inc. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test platform using a Real Time Digital Simulator is built in the laboratory.

The mathematical model of the problem is presented, and its objective is to meet the desired cycle time of each order and minimize the total idle time of the assembly line. An optimization model is developed to tackle the addressed problem, which involves two parts. A bilevel genetic algorithm with multiparent crossover is proposed to determine the operation assignment to workstations and the task proportion of each shared operation being processed on different workstations. A heuristic operation routing rule is then presented to route the shared operation of each product to an appropriate workstation when it should be processed. Experiments based on industrial data are conducted to validate the proposed optimization model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model to solve the FALB problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9793107","volume":"38","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4444622/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic-Algorithm-Based Optimization Model for Solving the Flexible Assembly Line Balancing Problem With Work Sharing and Workstation Revisiting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic-Algorithm-Based Optimization Model for Solving the Flexible Assembly Line Balancing Problem With Work Sharing and Workstation Revisiting","sourcePdf":"38tsmcc02-guo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105792S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4454022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4454022","articleId":"4444622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4444625,"authors":[{"name":"Lipo Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/4454022/4444625/4444625-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lipo Wang (M'97\u2014A'97\u2014SM'98) received the B.S. degree from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 1983, and the Ph.D. degree from Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, in 1988.","He is currently with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

The conventional verification table approach has significant drawbacks. Recently, neural networks have been used for password authentication to overcome the shortcomings of traditional approaches. In neural network approaches to password authentication, no verification table is needed; rather, encrypted neural network weights are stored within the system.

This study proposes the use of a Hopfield neural network technique for password authentication. In comparison to existing layered neural network techniques, the proposed method provides better accuracy and quicker response time to registration and password changes.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2007.913901","startPage":"265","endPage":"268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/4454022/04444627.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2007.913901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Password Authentication Using Hopfield Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Hopfield neural networks","Neural networks","Cryptography","Intrusion detection","Delay","Pattern matching","Information security","Computer security","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","Hopfield neural nets","message authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["password authentication","Hopfield neural network","system security","encryption","pattern matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hopfield networks","pattern matching","security"]},{"kwd":["Hopfield networks","pattern matching","security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Password Authentication Using Hopfield Neural Networks","volume":"38","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4444627/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9793110","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Password Authentication Using Hopfield Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"38tsmcc02-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041936S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4454022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4454022","articleId":"4444627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4444628,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The exact formulation of the EM fields over a lossy ground involves the numerical evaluation of the Sommerfeld integrals, which are slowly converging and can only be computed in the frequency domain. For this reason, a great effort has been devoted in the derivation of approximate formulas that can provide accurate results with low computational costs. The most popular one is the Cooray-Rubinstein formula, which has been proposed in the frequency domain. Here, its time-domain counterpart is mathematically derived, and an efficient algorithm for its implementation is presented together with some comparisons with the exact approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4455652/04444633.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2007.913226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2007.913226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4455652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooray\u2013Rubinstein Formula for the Evaluation of Lightning Radial Electric Fields: Derivation and Implementation in the Time Domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Adaptation model","Mathematical model","Numerical models","RLC circuits","Equivalent circuits","Time domain analysis","Lightning","Frequency domain analysis","Couplings","Chromium","Surges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light propagation","telecommunication transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cooray-Rubinstein formula","lightning radial electric field","ground conductivity","lightning-induced voltage","overhead line","lossy ground","Sommerfeld integral"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absorbing media","electromagnetic (EM) radiation","ground wave propagation","lightning","lightning return stroke"]},{"kwd":["Absorbing media","electromagnetic (EM) radiation","ground wave propagation","lightning","lightning return stroke"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooray\u2013Rubinstein Formula for the Evaluation of Lightning Radial Electric Fields: Derivation and Implementation in the Time Domain","volume":"50","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4444633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9799924","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooray\u2013Rubinstein Formula for the Evaluation of Lightning Radial Electric Fields: Derivation and Implementation in the Time Domain","sourcePdf":"50temc01-caligaris-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073994S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4455652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4455652","articleId":"4444633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444634,"authors":[{"name":"Siamak Bonyadi-Ram","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Research Laboratory, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4455652/4444634/4444634-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siamak Bonyadi-Ram received the B.S. degree in electrical (telecommunications) engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, in 1997 and 2005, respectively.","From 1998 to 2006, he was with the Communication Regulatory Authority of Iran as a Radio Frequency Spectrum Expert.

The distributed inductive energy-storing elements are used in the modified AT model (designated as ATIL model, where IL stands for inductive loading) to control the propagation speed of the upward traveling current wave without using an artificial, higher permittivity dielectric medium, as done in the original AT model. The variation of the propagation speed along the channel is also considered in the proposed model. As in the original AT model, resistive loading is used to account for the current attenuation with height. Numerical solution of the electric field integral equation in the time domain using the with appropriate boundary conditions yields a time-space distribution of current along the lightning channel. This current distribution and the resultant electromagnetic fields for the ATIL model are compared with those predicted by other time-domain and frequency-domain electromagnetic models. The current distribution predicted by the ATIL model exhibits features (such as current dispersion) that are more consistent with optical observations of lightning compared to the predictions of the original AT model.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2007.913221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4455652/04444634.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2007.913221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4455652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Representation of Lightning Return Stroke as a Lossy Monopole Antenna With Inductive Loading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444634/","displayDocTitle":"On Representation of Lightning Return Stroke as a Lossy Monopole Antenna With Inductive Loading","volume":"50","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9806285","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4444634/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Representation of Lightning Return Stroke as a Lossy Monopole Antenna With Inductive Loading","sourcePdf":"50temc01-bonyadiram.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072047S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4455652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4455652","articleId":"4444634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444636,"authors":[{"name":"Henglin Chen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4455652/4444636/4444636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Henglin Chen was born in Jiangxi, China, in 1979.

An algorithm that realizes complex Boolean functions with fewer magnetologic elements than previous papers is presented.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2007.914470","startPage":"890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4455723/04444643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2007.914470","endPage":"895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4455723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Full Adder Design Using Serially Connected Single-Layer Magnetic Tunnel Junction Elements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Full Adder Design Using Serially Connected Single-Layer Magnetic Tunnel Junction Elements","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4444643/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9897204","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Full Adder Design Using Serially Connected Single-Layer Magnetic Tunnel Junction Elements","sourcePdf":"55ted03-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072385S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4455723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4455723","articleId":"4444643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444671,"authors":[{"name":"Hermann S.

When it comes to the integration into current wireless local area network (WLAN) standards, dynamic OFDMA raises several implementation issues which are neglected in theoretical papers. Putting this emerging approach into practice requires to treat these issues accordingly and to demonstrate the feasibility of the system design. In this paper, we propose a dynamic OFDMA integration for the physical layer of the widespread IEEE 802.11a standard. To test our implementation and demonstrate its practical relevance we use a pragmatic approach: We prototype multiuser dynamic OFDMA on a real-time software-defined radio testbed for WLANs. We discuss details of our implementation and provide measurements showing that it does not introduce significant overhead into the IEEE 802.11a system at high subcarrier allocation quality. We particularly focus on the problems of our integration as well as the concepts and limitations of the used testbed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructure for the Development of Networks and Communities","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444645/4444646/04444671.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructure for the Development of Networks and Communities","doi":"10.1109/TRIDENTCOM.2007.4444671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRIDENTCOM.2007.4444671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating multiuser dynamic OFDMA into IEEE 802.11a and prototyping it on a real-time software-defined radio testbed","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software prototyping","Software testing","OFDM","Wireless LAN","Frequency conversion","Downlink","Physical layer","Delay","Dynamic scheduling","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","software radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser dynamic OFDMA","IEEE 802.11a","real-time software-defined radio testbed","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","wireless networks","subcarrier allocation","wireless local area network standards","WLAN standards"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Integrating multiuser dynamic OFDMA into IEEE 802.11a and prototyping it on a real-time software-defined radio testbed","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4444671/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9789313","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating multiuser dynamic OFDMA into IEEE 802.11a and prototyping it on a real-time software-defined radio testbed","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"TRIDENTC-00-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056096S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444645","isNumber":"4444646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444645","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4444646","articleId":"4444671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4444684,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Broustis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Broustis","id":"37298407900"},{"name":"Jakob Eriksson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Eriksson","id":"37273830500"},{"name":"Srikanth V.

We justify the hardware and software design choices that we make in order to facilitate these requirements. For ease of maintenance and convenience, each node is diskless, and we utilize power-over-ethernet through an Ethernet connection with a central server. We ensure that the software can be easily modified; this provides for easier module implementation and parameter tuning.

networks are intended to be future spectrum-efficient systems that can adapt to their operating environments by extending software defined radio (SDR) technologies. A testbed system for cognitive radio needs to be able to deal with sensitive radio components to verify low-level protocols and functions on CR terminals, and to evaluate high-level network protocols and throughputs using various applications running on a large wireless network. We propose a testbed for cognitve-radio networks under which terminals communicate using both real CR devices and those virtually configured in the sensing environment. All the stacks from MAC/PHY to the application layer are programmable and conform to the common interface of the simulation/emulation environment for CR networks, called CWC-EF. The physical layer is either configured as a real CR device or as a virtual module with a cognitive component either by sensing real spectra or time-driven radio-feature extracted data that are generated from radio data. A real-device approach is used to verify the radio configuration and a virtual configuration is used to evaluate the network as many CR terminals are expected to be utilized. The testbed is flexible enough to re-build CR functions and protocols under any spectrum-sensing environment. CWC-EF is also intended to be used not only by local users but also remote users via the Internet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9800854","htmlLink":"/document/4444722/","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale Hybrid Testbed for Cognitive Radio Networks by Real-and-Virtual Execution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale Hybrid Testbed for Cognitive Radio Networks by Real-and-Virtual Execution","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"TRIDENTC-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.178346S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444645","isNumber":"4444646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444645","xplore-issue":"4444646","articleId":"4444722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4444740,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00c7ois Horlin","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fran\u00c7ois","lastName":"Horlin","id":"37268157100"},{"name":"Andr\u00c9 Bourdoux","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Andr\u00c9","lastName":"Bourdoux","id":"37296640900"},{"name":"Eduardo Lopez-Estraviz","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Lopez-Estraviz","id":"38272549400"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre","id":"37271995400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4444740","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"To meet the data rate and quality-of-service requirements of the future cellular systems, new air interfaces are currently under development.

We analytically demonstrate that SC-FDMA is a special case of CP-CDMA, in which the CDMA codes have been optimized to minimize symbol estimation mean square error under a constraint of received power. Numerical results confirm that SC-FDMA significantly outperforms CP-CDMA at high user loads.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (MC DS-CDMA) system communicating over a dispersive ST Rayleigh fading channel, where the channel estimates are attained by using subspace-based blind techniques. Smart antennas are employed to provide increased degrees of freedom and, hence, to improve both the attainable single-user performance and the multiuser capacity. Furthermore, two adaptive subspace-tracking algorithms, i.e., the projection approximation subspace-tracking deflation (PASTd) algorithm and the noise-averaged Hermitian-Jacobi fast subspace tracking (NAHJ-FST) algorithm, are employed for the sake of reducing the computational complexity imposed by eigenvalue decomposition. When employing the NAHJ-FST algorithm, the group-blind MUD employing an antenna array having M = 2 elements exposed to uncorrelated fading achieved a 4.2-dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) gain at a bit error rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n compared with that employing a single antenna, which is an explicit benefit of its increased computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04444741.pdf","startPage":"3235","endPage":"3241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time- and Frequency-Domain-Spread Generalized Multicarrier DS-CDMA Using Subspace-Based Blind and Group-Blind Space\u2013Time Multiuser Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444741/","displayDocTitle":"Time- and Frequency-Domain-Spread Generalized Multicarrier DS-CDMA Using Subspace-Based Blind and Group-Blind Space\u2013Time Multiuser Detection","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222413","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4444741/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time- and Frequency-Domain-Spread Generalized Multicarrier DS-CDMA Using Subspace-Based Blind and Group-Blind Space\u2013Time Multiuser Detection","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-hu-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094936S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4444741","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4444742,"authors":[{"name":"Osamah Alamri","affiliation":["University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire, UK"],"firstName":"Osamah","lastName":"Alamri","id":"37299804500"},{"name":"Soon X.

Given a trellis representing an ISI channel, the soft-output M-algorithm (SOMA) reduces the complexity of equalization by retaining only the best M survivors at each trellis interval. The remaining survivors are discarded. The novelty of the SOMA is the use of discarded paths to obtain soft-information. Through a simple update-and-discard procedure, the SOMA extracts reliable soft-information from discarded paths which enables a large trellis to be successfully decoded with a relatively small value of M. To decode a trellis representing a MIMO frequency selective fading channel, two challenges are faced. Not only that the trellis has a large number of states, the number of branches per trellis interval is also enormous. The soft-output trellis/tree M-algorithm (SOTTMA) expands each trellis interval into a tree-like structure and performs the M-algorithm twice: once at each trellis interval to reduce the number of states and the other at each tree sub-level to remove unwanted branches. With the proposed technique, high-order trellises with million of branches per interval can be decoded with modest complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-complexity equalization techniques for ISI and MIMO wireless channels in iterative decoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4444498/04444757.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-complexity equalization techniques for ISI and MIMO wireless channels in iterative decoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4444757/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"February 2008","accessionNumber":"9901387","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-complexity equalization techniques for ISI and MIMO wireless channels in iterative decoding","sourcePdf":"0208jsac256Wong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199302S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4444498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4444498","articleId":"4444757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4444758,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4444498/4444758/4444758-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Hu received her B.S. and M.S. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2001 and 2004, and Ph.D. degree from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, in 2007, all in Electrical Engineering.

One, called frequency domain superimposed pilot technique (FDSPT), superimposes pilot tones onto scaled or deleted data tones, which preserves spectral efficiency at the expense of a slight performance loss. The other, called frequency expanding technique (FET), multiplexes pilot tones by displacing data tones, which slightly reduces spectral efficiency. Using FDM pilots in SC systems facilitates flexible and efficient assignment of signals to available spectrum. We propose an iterative frequency domain decision-directed interference cancellation technique to reduce the intersymbol interference level of SC signals with FDSPT pilots (resulting from the suppression of data tones). Moreover, we propose a low complexity frequency domain iterative decision-directed channel estimation (IDDCE) technique for SC systems using FDM pilots.

When a high-mobility terminal exists in the system, the channel state may change within a DFT block. Then, the ISI reduction performance of FDE degrades since cyclicity of the channel matrix is lost. We propose to divide a received data block into multiple subblocks to decrease the channel transition within the DFT block in fast fading environments. Also, to satisfy periodicity of the received signal in each subblock, we introduce a pseudo cyclic prefix technique. The results of numerical analysis show that the proposed method can effectively decrease the error floor in fast fading environments.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"359","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444498","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4444498/04444766.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Intersymbol interference","OFDM","Degradation","Numerical analysis","Peak to average power ratio","Standardization","WiMAX","Frequency domain analysis","Size control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","equalisers","fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subblock processing","MMSE-FDE","fast fading","frequency domain equalization","intersymbol interference","ISI","frequency selective fading","single carrier systems","high-mobility terminal","channel state","DFT block","pseudo cyclic prefix technique","fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Subblock processing in MMSE-FDE under fast fading environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444766/","volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4444766/","accessionNumber":"9757607","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subblock processing in MMSE-FDE under fast fading environments","sourcePdf":"0208jsac359kambara.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062584S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4444498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4444498","articleId":"4444766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4444768,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4444498/4444768/4444768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feifei Gao (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree from the McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore.

In this paper, we consider the combination of FDPE with parallel and successive Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) and propose two novel FDPE MIMO schemes, which are referred to as FDPE-P-THP and FDPE-S-THP, respectively, based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. The ordering algorithm in the FDPE-S-THP scheme is considered and it is shown that the system with even a randomly selected order can perform almost as well as that with the optimal one. This paper further develops an accurate theoretical performance analysis methodology for the proposed FDPE-THP schemes. Numerical results along with analytical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our proposed schemes compared to the conventional FDPE MIMO schemes. The channel estimation errors and channel variation effects on the proposed system are also investigated. It is shown that the performance degradation due to channel variation can be efficiently reduced by applying channel prediction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4444498/04444769.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency domain pre-equalization with transmit precoding for MIMO broadcast wireless channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","MIMO","Broadcasting","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Radiofrequency interference","Mean square error methods","Performance analysis","Channel estimation","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","equalisers","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain preequalization","transmit precoding","MIMO broadcast wireless channels","multi-input multi-output frequency selective channels","broadcast transmissions","multiple receivers","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","minimum mean square error criterion","MMSE","channel estimation errors","channel variation effects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency domain pre-equalization with transmit precoding for MIMO broadcast wireless channels","volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4444769/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2008","accessionNumber":"9757610","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency domain pre-equalization with transmit precoding for MIMO broadcast wireless channels","sourcePdf":"0208jsac389letaief.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0725S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4444498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4444498","articleId":"4444769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444770,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Botros Shenouda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4444498/4444770/4444770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Botros Shenouda received the B.Sc.

We develop a unified framework for joint transceiver design of these two dual systems by considering design criteria that are expressed as functions of the (logarithm of the) Mean Square Error (MSE) of the individual data streams. By deriving two inequalities that involve the logarithms of the individual MSEs, we obtain optimal designs for two broad classes of communication objectives, namely those that are Schur-convex and Schur-concave functions of these logarithms. These two classes embrace several design criteria for which the optimal transceiver design has remained an open problem. For Schur-convex objectives, the optimal design results in data streams with equal MSEs. In addition to other desirable properties, this design simultaneously minimizes the total MSE and the average bit error rate, and maximizes the Gaussian mutual information; a property that is not achieved by a linear transceiver. Moreover, we show that the optimal design yields objective values that are superior to the corresponding optimal objective value for a linear transceiver. For Schur-concave objectives, the optimal DFE design results in linear equalization and the optimal THP design results in linear precoding. The proposed design framework can be regarded as a counterpart of the existing framework for linear transceiver design.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4444498/04444770.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444498","startPage":"401","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for designing mimo systems with decision feedback equalization or tomlinson-harashima precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4444770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A framework for designing mimo systems with decision feedback equalization or tomlinson-harashima precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4444770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2008","accessionNumber":"9901390","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4444770/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for designing mimo systems with decision feedback equalization or tomlinson-harashima precoding","sourcePdf":"0208jsac401botros.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093179S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4444498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4444498","articleId":"4444770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4444775,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yongguang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4505412/4444775/4444775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Yongguang was born in China in 1962.

Because of the complexity in determining the probability distribution, it is difficult to use a traditional probability theory to process the samples and assess the degree of uncertainty. Based on the grey relational theory and the norm theory, the grey distance information approach for small-sample processing is proposed. The correlative problems, including the definitions and the characteristics of the grey distance information quantity and the average grey distance information quantity, the point estimation and the confidence interval estimation algorithm, and the acceptance and rejection criteria of the samples, are also proposed. In addition, the information whitening ratio is introduced to select the weight algorithm and to compare the different sample sets. Several examples are given to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach. The examples show that the proposed approach, which has no demand for the probability distribution of small samples, is feasible and effective. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

Among the sources of variability, line-edge-roughness (LER) and random dopant (RD) fluctuations are significant in current technology nodes. In this paper, the impact of the LER and RD on the matching performance of FinFETs is investigated for the LSTP-32 nm node, where these devices represent an attractive alternative to the planar CMOS transistors. Line-edge-roughness contributions from the fin, top-, and side wall-gates of n- and p-channel FinFETs are compared by means of 2-D and 3-D technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations, performed with a quantum-corrected hydrodynamic model on large statistical ensembles. Correlations between geometrical roughness and resulting electrical parameters are analyzed to provide further insight into the impact of the LER. A noise analysis approach is adopted to evaluate the impact of RD fluctuations throughout the impurity concentration ranges of interest, providing a direct comparison with the line-edge-roughness contributions. The impact of the extension doping profile specifications on the LER- and RD-induced mismatch is investigated, highlighting the potential drawbacks of junction engineering.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.917838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4522577/04445642.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.917838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4522577","startPage":"291","endPage":"298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of LER and Random Dopant Fluctuations on FinFET Matching Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of LER and Random Dopant Fluctuations on FinFET Matching Performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10075607","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4445642/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of LER and Random Dopant Fluctuations on FinFET Matching Performance","sourcePdf":"07tnano03-baravelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160203S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4522577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4522577","articleId":"4445642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4445643,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Becherer","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4522577/4445643/4445643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Markus Becherer was born in Buehl, Germany.

To induce cyclostationarity at the transmitter, zero padding to every symbol packet can be considered. Some subspace methods are proposed for the channel estimation by exploiting the induced cyclostationarity. Due to zero padding, the covariance matrix of received signal vectors can have a special structure. Utilizing this structure, we can estimate channel impulse responses through factorization. In this correspondence, we propose a factorization based approach to estimate channel impulse responses.

Given sufficiently wide transmission bandwidth, the impulse response of the shallow-water acoustic channel is often sparse as the multipath arrivals become resolvable. In the presence of significant surface waves, the multipath arrivals associated with surface scattering fluctuate rapidly over time, in the sense that the complex gain, the arrival time, and the Dopplers of each arrival all change dynamically. A sparse channel estimation technique is developed based on the delay-Doppler-spread function representation of the channel. The delay-Doppler-spread function may be considered as a first-order approximation to the rapidly time-varying channel in which each channel component is associated with Doppler shifts that are assumed constant over an averaging interval. The sparse structure of the delay-Doppler-spread function is then exploited by sequentially choosing the dominant components that minimize a least squares error. The advantage of this approach is that it captures both the channel structure as well as its dynamics without the need of explicit dynamic channel modeling. As the symbols are populated with the sample Dopplers, the increase in complexity depends on the channel Doppler spread and can be significant for a severely Doppler-spread channel. Comparison is made between nonsparse recursive least squares (RLS) channel estimation, sparse channel impulse response estimation, and estimation using the proposed approach. The results are demonstrated using experimental data. In training mode, the proposed approach shows a 3-dB reduction in signal prediction error. In decision-directed mode, it improves significantly the robustness of the performance of the channel-estimate-based equalizer against rapid channel fluctuations.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2007.906409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4445725/04445731.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2007.906409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Rapidly Time-Varying Sparse Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Rapidly Time-Varying Sparse Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445731/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9778291","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4445731/","volume":"32","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Rapidly Time-Varying Sparse Channels","sourcePdf":"32joe04-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117699S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4445725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"288","xplore-issue":"4445725","articleId":"4445731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4445733,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric Maussang","affiliation":["Applied Electromagnetism Group (GEA), University of Paris X, Ville d'Avray, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4445725/4445733/4445733-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maussang graduated in electrical engineering from the Grenoble Institute of Technology (INP Grenoble), France, in 2002, and received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Grenoble 1, Grenoble, France, in 2005.

Passive time reversal essentially is equivalent to active time reversal with the communications link being in the opposite direction. This paper describes passive time reversal communications which enables multiple users to send information simultaneously to the time reversal array. Experimental results at 3.5 kHz with a 1-kHz bandwidth demonstrate that as many as six users can transmit information over a 4-km range in a 120-m-deep water using quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, achieving an aggregate data rate of 6 kb/s. Moreover, the same data rate has been achieved at 20-km range by three users using 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445738/","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4445738/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9794224","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Communications Using Passive Time Reversal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Communications Using Passive Time Reversal","sourcePdf":"32joe04-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099383S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4445725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4445725","articleId":"4445738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4445757,"authors":[{"name":"Lucian Busoniu","bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/4454022/4445757/4445757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lucian Bu\u015foniu received the M.Sc. degree and the Postgraduate Diploma from the Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania, in 2003 and 2004, respectively, both in control engineering.

The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2007.913919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2007.913919","startPage":"156","endPage":"172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/4454022/04445757.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Survey of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Survey of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9793106","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4445757/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comprehensive Survey of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"38tsmcc02-busoniu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.219415S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4454022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"790","xplore-issue":"4454022","articleId":"4445757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4445758,"authors":[{"name":"Selwyn Piramuthu","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Operations Management, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/4492353/4445758/4445758-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Selwyn Piramuthu received the B.

Given their processing power and memory capabilities, RFID tags can be used in a wide range of applications including those where barcodes can and cannot be used. Although the potential exists, it is hampered by the relatively high unit cost of implementation and issues related to privacy and security. As with any technology, unit cost of RFID tags and their related systems is bound to come down. As for security and privacy issues, the main impediments are limited processing power, memory, and external power to operate these tags. In spite of these resource constraints, recent years have seen a plethora of new authentication protocols that promise to alleviate security and privacy concerns associated with the use of RFID tags. We evaluate a few protocols that have been suggested for use in passive RFID-tagged systems and identify vulnerabilities that may be present. When appropriate, we present modifications of existing protocols to prevent identified vulnerabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921444","htmlLink":"/document/4445758/","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight Cryptographic Authentication in Passive RFID-Tagged Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight Cryptographic Authentication in Passive RFID-Tagged Systems","sourcePdf":"38tsmcc03-piramuthu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117579S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4492353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4492353","articleId":"4445758","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4445795,"authors":[{"name":"Dehzad Razavi","firstName":"Dehzad","lastName":"Razavi","id":"38125115700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"4445795","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":631},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Transceivers","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","ultra wideband communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airwaves","gadgets","Bluetooth","Wi-Fi","IEEE 802.11 standard","ultrawideband systems"]}],"abstract":"People not only talk on the airwaves, they increasingly expect their gadgets to do the same.

Finally it is seen that q- ary PCGC can be optimized further through proper component design on GF(q).","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445808","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445808.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Q-ary PCGC based on PEG algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445808/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Q-ary PCGC based on PEG algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9834033","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4445808/","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Q-ary PCGC based on PEG algorithm","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056024S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4445811,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhan","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Wei Zhan","id":"38119360600"},{"name":"Guangxi Zhu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Guangxi Zhu","id":"37281082400"},{"name":"Li Peng","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Li Peng","id":"37954556200"},{"name":"Xi Yan","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Xi Yan","id":"38125636400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445811","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Arithmetic","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","AWGN","Laboratories","Error correction codes","Iterative algorithms","Iterative decoding","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","progressive edge growth","D matrix","Q matrix","permutation vector","arbitrary circulant permutation matrix","PEG algorithm","error correction","linear-time encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","quasi-cyclic (QC) codes","progressive edge growth (PEG)"]}],"abstract":"We propose a general method for constructing regular and irregular quasi-cyclic LDPC codes based on the modified PEG (progressive edge growth) graph.

However, in many practical applications the signal of interest (SOI) is intrinsically wideband and coherent interferences exist, as either a natural result of a multipath propagation effect, or intentional unfriendly jamming. For wideband signals, we can use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to divide the array outputs into many narrowband frequency bins and then apply the RCB to each bin separately. However, the main lobe beamwidth of the RCB decreases with frequency, which is undesirable in some applications such as power estimation in source localization. In this paper, we present an algorithm that do a trade-off between array aperture and decorrelation ability to build a wideband coherent RCB that has constant power width for each frequency bins, and is robust against both coherent interferences and steering vector errors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","startPage":"72","endPage":"75","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445826.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust wideband Capon beamforming in the presence of coherent interferences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4445826/","displayDocTitle":"Robust wideband Capon beamforming in the presence of coherent interferences","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9830025","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust wideband Capon beamforming in the presence of coherent interferences","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055598S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4445840,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jing Yang","id":"37292635800"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xiaomin Mu","id":"37287621700"},{"name":"Shouyi Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Shouyi Yang","id":"37292116100"},{"name":"Lin Qi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Lin Qi","id":"37288542200"},{"name":"Hideo Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Mie University, Japan"],"lastName":"Hideo Kobayashi","id":"37279510000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445840","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Nonlinear distortion","Bit error rate","Power amplifiers","Digital modulation","Fading","High power amplifiers","Computer simulation","Solid state circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","travelling wave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","nonlinear noise mitigation","multicarrier digital modulation technique","frequency selective fading","high power amplifier","bit error rate","traveling wave tube amplifier","solid state power amplifier","clipping method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","HPA","clipping","nonlinear compensation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier digital modulation technique that has been under extensive study and research in recent years, in terms of considering its various advantage in combating the severe effects of the frequency selective fading. However, the OFDM system suffers from the strong sensitivity to the nonlinear distortion, introduced by the transmitting high power amplifier (HPA), since the OFDM system has the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Clipping is the simple but infective method to low the high PAPR; however, it causes nonlinear distortion too. So in this paper, we propose a new approach to compensate the nonlinearity caused by clipping and HPA. Its performance is verified through computer simulations. Specifically, the enhanced performance in terms of the bit error rate (BER) is documented for both the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) and the solid state power amplifier (SSPA).","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445840","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","startPage":"128","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear noise mitigation by decision-aided reconstruction in OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear noise mitigation by decision-aided reconstruction in OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445840/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9834029","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4445840/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear noise mitigation by decision-aided reconstruction in OFDM system","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111186S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4445841,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Jing","affiliation":["School of information Science & Engineering, Northeastern university, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Gao Jing","id":"37543197800"},{"name":"Wang Jinkuan","affiliation":["School of information Science & Engineering, Northeastern university, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Wang Jinkuan","id":"37298863500"},{"name":"Xie Zhibin","affiliation":["School of information Science & Engineering, Northeastern university, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Xie Zhibin","id":"37394603900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445841","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Signal processing algorithms","Transmitting antennas","Minimax techniques","Computational complexity","Partial transmit sequences","OFDM modulation","Information science","Power engineering and energy","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","computational complexity","MIMO systems","minimax techniques","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STBC MIMO-OFDM systems","peak-to-average power ratio","concurrent selective mapping algorithm","minmax criterion","orthogonal space-time block coded","computational complexity","multiple transmit antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO (multiple input multiple output)","OFDM (orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing)","PAPR (peak-to-average power ratio)","SLM (selective mapping)","STBC (space-time block coded)"]}],"abstract":"One main disadvantage of MIMO-OFDM is that the signals transmitted on different antennas might exhibit a prohibitively large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

In low frequency, the new approximation coefficients are obtained directly by the weighted mean value of the coefficients in different images. In addition, the fused image can be obtained by using the inverse multiwavelet transform for all important coefficients and approximation coefficients. Experimental results show, using this method, image noise can be reduced effectively and little image detail is lost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445858.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of image noise reduction based on multiwavelet transform and multiscale data fusion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Frequency","Low-frequency noise","PSNR","Signal processing","Image denoising","Image reconstruction","Wavelet transforms","Signal analysis","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","image denoising","image fusion","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image noise reduction","multiscale data fusion","data fusion","threshold operation","approximation coefficients","weighted mean value","inverse multiwavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image de-noising","Multiwavelet transform","multiscale data fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"A method of image noise reduction based on multiwavelet transform and multiscale data fusion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4445858/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9834004","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of image noise reduction based on multiwavelet transform and multiscale data fusion","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045725S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4445864,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Feng","affiliation":["Nation Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, China"],"lastName":"Shu Feng","id":"37590281900"},{"name":"Feng Xinxin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, China"],"lastName":"Feng Xinxin","id":"37872264800"},{"name":"Sun Jintao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, China"],"lastName":"Sun Jintao","id":"37414568900"},{"name":"Cheng Shixin","affiliation":["Nation Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Cheng Shixin","id":"37368808500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445864","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Maximum likelihood estimation","Interpolation","Polynomials","Partial transmit sequences","Linear approximation","Equalizers","Performance gain","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Doppler broadening","equalisers","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalization","OFDM","sparse time-variant channel","channel impulse response","second-order polynomial","NDS","normalized Doppler spread","maximum likelihood estimation","pilot sequence","zero-forcing equalizer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","equalization","second-order polynomial","time-variant","sparse","normalized Doppler spread"]}],"abstract":"Channel impulse response (CIR) is supposed to be second-order polynomial (SOP) variation within two neighboring blocks with each consisting of several OFDM symbols for NDS<0.1, where NDS denotes normalized Doppler spread. Subsequently, channel estimator ML+SOPI is proposed, where ML denotes maximum likelihood used to estimate the CIR of pilot sequence (PS) whereas SOP interpolation (SOPI) is to compute CIR of each symbol by these estimated CIRs of three closest PSs. There are three implementations for SOPI: scheme A employs a symbol- level SOPI to compute CIR of each symbol where CIR is viewed as constant during single symbol; scheme B gets the CIR of symbol midpoint by point-level SOPI, which represents the CIR of entire symbol; scheme C uses the same point-level interpolation as scheme B, but CIR of each symbol is approximated as linear varying not constant, and a zero-forcing equalizer is used. To further improve performance, threshold matrix (TM) is introduced into these schemes.

The primary aim of the proposed algorithm is to overcome the problems incurred by the noise disturbance and texture insufficiency. Specifically, our method performs a homogeneous area extraction based on texture variation using a nonlinear filter, Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus. Then a novel 3-D Pulse-Coupled Neural Network model is constructed to perform optical flow optimization. Because of the excellent clustering capability of the PCNN, the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quality of optical flow estimation in the presence of noise. The enhanced optical flow field and extraction results are combined to solve the problem of insufficient texture. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in both synthetic and real testing images to demonstrate its excellent performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445874","startPage":"264","endPage":"267","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445874.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel optical flow optimization using pulse-coupled neural network and smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical computing","Optical fiber networks","Image motion analysis","Optical pulses","Neural networks","Nonlinear optics","Optical filters","Optical noise","Clustering algorithms","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image sequences","image texture","neural nets","nonlinear filters","optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical flow optimization","pulse-coupled neural network","smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus","noise disturbance","nonlinear filter","homogeneous area extraction","texture variation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical flow field","nonlinear","optimization","correlation","PCNN","SUSAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Novel optical flow optimization using pulse-coupled neural network and smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4445874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9833999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel optical flow optimization using pulse-coupled neural network and smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051052S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4445885,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Analysis and experimental results show that the best segmentation output can be drawn from the simple and sophisticated ultrasound images using the spiking neural networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate detection of prostate boundary in ultrasound images using biologically-inspired spiking neural network","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445885","endPage":"311","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445885.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","startPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445885","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Neural networks","Image segmentation","Signal processing algorithms","Prostate cancer","Image analysis","Magnetic resonance imaging","Intelligent networks","Biomedical signal processing","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","diseases","image segmentation","median filters","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prostate boundary detection","ultrasound images","biologically-inspired spiking neural network","accurate boundary detection algorithm","radiologists","median filter","PCNN segmentation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate detection of prostate boundary in ultrasound images using biologically-inspired spiking neural network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4445885/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9830064","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate detection of prostate boundary in ultrasound images using biologically-inspired spiking neural network","confLoc":"Xiamen","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059456S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4445895,"authors":[{"name":"Ramin Shariat-Yazdi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"lastName":"Ramin Shariat-Yazdi","id":"38272115200"},{"name":"Tad Kwasniewski","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"lastName":"Tad Kwasniewski","id":"37276594400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445895","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":175},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable K-best MIMO detector architecture and FPGA implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445895","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Field programmable gate arrays","Maximum likelihood decoding","Throughput","Signal processing algorithms","Quality of service","Receivers","Bit error rate","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity reconfigurable k-best MIMO detector architecture","FPGA implementation","K-best decoding algorithm","maximum-likelihood detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","K-best","Reconfigurable hardware","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In a MIMO communication system, K-best decoding algorithm achieves near optimal performance with reduced complexity.

As a consequence, there is no voltage drop between drain and source terminals of the current source, and bulk-source voltage effect of the input transistor is removed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445919","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445919.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"446","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common-mode rejection ratio analysis of rail-rail input stage fully differential two-stage OP-AMP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Common-mode rejection ratio analysis of rail-rail input stage fully differential two-stage OP-AMP","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4445919/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9834054","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common-mode rejection ratio analysis of rail-rail input stage fully differential two-stage OP-AMP","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039778S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4445923,"authors":[{"name":"Chunshan Du","affiliation":["Department of electronics engineering, Beijing JiaoTong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chunshan Du","id":"37088131923"},{"name":"Zhangfa Liu","affiliation":["Department of electronics engineering, Beijing JiaoTong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhangfa Liu","id":"37087162241"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445923","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Inductors","MIM capacitors","Wireless communication","Circuits","Bonding","Power dissipation","Grounding","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","earthing","MIM devices","power inductors","thin film capacitors","thin film inductors","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-chip CMOS linear power amplifier","ISM-band","low-voltage power amplifier","short range wireless communication","bonding-wire inductors","MIM capacitors","grounding strategy","spectreRF simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-voltage power amplifier","CMOS power amplifier","linear power amplifier","adaptive biasing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445923","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445923.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A single-chip CMOS linear power amplifier for ISM-band application","abstract":"A low-voltage CMOS linear power amplifier (PA) is presented for 2.4GHz ISM-band short range wireless communication in this paper.

This paper develops a rapid antenna selection method for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) diversity systems which use maximum ratio transmit (MRT) at the transmitter and Maximum Ratio Combine (MRC) at the receiver. In this method, at each step, a new antenna is added to the selected antenna subset to make sure that they can provide the largest SNR gain. Comparing to the optimum antenna selection, this method reduces the number of antenna subsets to be searched and the computation for each step, and thus, reduces the complexity. Computer simulations show that the BER, capacity and SNR gain performances of our algorithm are nearly the same as the optimum one which needs a full search of all the possible antenna subsets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rapid antenna selection for MIMO-diversity systems","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445949","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445949.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"A rapid antenna selection for MIMO-diversity systems","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4445949/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9830045","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rapid antenna selection for MIMO-diversity systems","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037375S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4445950,"authors":[{"name":"Wendong Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Wendong Yang","id":"37290576900"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yueming Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Youyun Xu","id":"37277724400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445950","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Signal processing","Analytical models","Fading","Shadow mapping","Fuzzy systems","International collaboration","Analog-digital conversion","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fuzzy set theory","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy collaborative spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radio","spectrum allocation problem","distributed sensing","secondary users","sensing decision reliability","fuzzy comprehensive evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","collaborative spectrum sensing","fuzzy comprehensive evaluation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445950","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445950","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology to solve the challenging spectrum allocation problem.

Then the algorithm for estimating the carrier frequency offset based on the cyclic autocorrelation function of the cyclostationary signal is proposed. Compared with those algorithms using pilots directly, this new algorithm can get larger frequency offset estimation up to half of the bandwidth of the OFDM system without initial acquisition, and the symbol timing can be estimated as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445951.pdf","startPage":"570","endPage":"573","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A synchronization algorithm based on cyclostationarity and pilots in OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Timing","Frequency synchronization","Bandwidth","Educational institutions","Physics","Autocorrelation","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization algorithm","OFDM system cyclostationarity","frequency offset estimation algorithms","semiblind algorithm","cyclic autocorrelation function","symbol timing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cyclostationarity","pilots","frequency offset and symbol timing estimation","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"A synchronization algorithm based on cyclostationarity and pilots in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4445951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9830036","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A synchronization algorithm based on cyclostationarity and pilots in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058884S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4445952,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-mei Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Sheng-mei Zhao","id":"37293672300"},{"name":"Bao-yu Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Bao-yu Zheng","id":"37272833700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4445952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Multiuser detection","MIMO","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Quantum mechanics","Multiaccess communication","Detection algorithms","Decorrelation","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","signal processing","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum covariance shaping least squares estimator","multiuser detection","MIMO systems","linear estimator","quantum signal processing","covariance shaping least squares estimator","synchronous DS-CDMA communications system","decorrelation detection","MMSE detection method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covariance shaping least squares estimator","quantum signal processing","multiuser detection","MIMO detection scheme","probability of bit error"]}],"abstract":"Covariance shaping least squares estimator is a new kind of linear estimator based on covariance shaping in quantum signal processing (QSP) framework, it is a biased estimator directed at improving the performance of traditional least- squares (LS) estimator.

Both source node and destination node request free nodes around them to perform as virtual antenna arrays based on the simplest selection criterion, and then a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is constructed. Different from the systems reported in literatures, signals from source node need three hops before arriving at destination.

The key technique of virtual MIMO is the user pairing algorithm. Traditional pairing algorithms do not take into account the influence of slow fading. They cannot achieve the maximum throughput. The proposed ADPS algorithm can overcome this deficiency. It considers both fast fading and slow fading. Moreover, it can adjust the influence of SNR (signal to noise ratio) on UE (user equipment) pairing result. Simulation results show that ADPS can provide higher throughput compared to traditional pairing algorithms and it also gives more flexibility to adjust the throughput of cell and the fairness between UEs.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445965","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4445798/4445799/04445965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2007.4445965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4445799","startPage":"626","endPage":"629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adjustable determinant pairing scheduling for virtual MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4445965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adjustable determinant pairing scheduling for virtual MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4445965/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9834034","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4445965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjustable determinant pairing scheduling for virtual MIMO system","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01252008-00166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042698S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2007-Dec. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4445798","isNumber":"4445799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4445798","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4445799","articleId":"4445965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4446003,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Qing-Chuan Zhang","id":"37854119600"},{"name":"Feng Shu","affiliation":["Nation Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Feng Shu","id":"37296299900"},{"name":"Jin-Tao Sun","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jin-Tao Sun","id":"37859924800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1446-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1447-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4446003","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Matching pursuit algorithms","Mobile communication","Delay estimation","Iterative methods","Pursuit algorithms","Transmitters","Signal processing","Knowledge engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","telecommunication computing","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse channel estimation","OFDM","GAIC model selection","path delays","matching pursuit algorithm","cyclic orthogonal training sequence","complexity","iterative searching procedure","generalized Akaike information criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","sparsity","matching pursuit","GAIC"]}],"abstract":"We propose a low-complexity sparse channel estimation method for OFDM system.

Amplitude of the FFT of the brain waves are used for the input data. Several techniques have been introduced for pre-processing the brain waves. They include segmentation along the time axis for fast response, nonlinear normalization to emphasize important information, averaging samples of the brain waves to suppress noise effects, reduction in the number of the samples to realize a small size network, and so on. In this paper, two kinds of generalization techniques, including adding small random noises to the input data and decaying connection weight magnitude, are applied. Their usefulness are analyzed and compared based on correct and error classifications. Simulation is carried out by using the brain waves, which are available from the web site of Colorado State University. The number of mental tasks is five.

The methods are based on a localization of image features and a spatial constellation search over the localized features. The accuracy and reliability of the methods depend on the success of both tasks: image feature localization and spatial constellation model search. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm for image feature localization. The method is based on complex-valued multiresolution Gabor features and their ranking using multiple hypothesis testing. The algorithm provides very accurate local image features over arbitrary scale and rotation. We discuss in detail issues such as selection of filter parameters, confidence measure, and the magnitude versus complex representation, and show on a large test sample how these influence the performance. The versatility and accuracy of the method is demonstrated on two profoundly different challenging problems (faces and license plates).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.916052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451160","startPage":"311","endPage":"325","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4451160/04446215.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Feature Localization by Multiple Hypothesis Testing of Gabor Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4446215/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image Feature Localization by Multiple Hypothesis Testing of Gabor Features","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9794409","pubMedId":"18270121","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Feature Localization by Multiple Hypothesis Testing of Gabor Features","sourcePdf":"17tip03-ilonen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118271S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4451160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4451160","articleId":"4446215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4446221,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-De Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4463922/4446221/4446221-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-De Jin was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1979.

For DAT, we consider space-time block coding (STBC) for the open-loop operation, and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) for the closed-loop operation. The probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for each scheme is presented, followed by the capacity expressions in terms of the received power components for the significant signal sources and the interference sources. The switching criteria among the transmission schemes are proposed and used for evaluating the capacity gain over the conventional SAT. The derived results are verified via Monte-Carlo simulations in a Rayleigh fading environment, for a given geographic location of the mobile station (MS). It is also demonstrated that an instantaneous adaptation of the transmission schemes, if applicable, can provide further capacity improvement over individual transmission schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.15","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446313.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Cooperative Transmission Schemes Using Distributed Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Cooperative Transmission Schemes Using Distributed Antennas","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4446313/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804125","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446313/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Cooperative Transmission Schemes Using Distributed Antennas","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"TA2-S2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059726S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4446314,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Jin Daniel Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Yong Jin Daniel","lastName":"Kim","id":"37697021900"},{"name":"Jan Bajcsy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Bajcsy","id":"37274147900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446314","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"abstract":"We consider differential MIMO architecture based on Cayley transform (Hassibi and Hochwald, 2002) when the channel state information is available neither at the transmitter nor the receiver.

Small variance in number of searching cycle is achieved by applying parallel partial Euclidean distance (PED) calculation units to the one-node-per-cycle architecture. Since the proposed architecture is able to evaluate more children nodes in a single cycle, average processing cycles and error performance are significantly improved with a per-block run-time constraint.

Specifically, joint inverse discrete wavelet packet and Fourier transformations (IDWPT and IDFT) of QAM symbols are calculated at the transmitter with the purpose of minimizing the PAPR of the OFDM frame to be transmitted. The wavelet packet tree representing a reversible IDWPT chosen at the transmitter is communicated to the receiver as side information, where the output of the DFT block is passed through the DWPT to recover the QAM symbols. As the DWPT is a orthonormal transformation, the proposed method preserves the average transmitted energy while maintaining the integrity of the transmitted information. With a small level of redundancy for side information, the proposed scheme achieves 5.5 dB reduction in PAPR over the traditional OFDM system as measured using the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the OFDM signals at the clipping probability of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446348.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"199","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Using Wavelet Packet Pre-Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Wavelet packets","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Transmitters","Nonlinear distortion","Optimization methods","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","wavelet packet preprocessing","peak-to-average power ratio reduction method","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation symbols","joint inverse discrete wavelet packet transformations","inverse discrete Fourier transformations","wavelet packet tree representation","DFT block","complementary cumulative distribution function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Using Wavelet Packet Pre-Processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446348/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9795954","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Using Wavelet Packet Pre-Processing","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"TP1-S2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048898S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4446349,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrie C.

The 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) band has recently drawn much interest because of the huge bandwidth that it can provide from 57-66 GHz unlicensed spectrum available worldwide. However, to date a system design supporting uncompressed HD video over WPAN is still lacking. In this paper, we develop, simulate, and evaluate an mmWave system for supporting uncompressed video streaming over wireless (UVoW). New features of the UVoW system incorporates: (i) UEP (unequal error protection) where different video bits (MSBs and LSBs) are protected differently, (ii) a multi-CRC to determine whether MSB or/and LSB portions are in error, (iii) UV-ARQ, uncompressed video retransmission protocol which allows the receiver to request only those portions of a video packet which have high importance. Simulations indicate that the UVoW system achieves significantly higher video quality than normal systems under various wireless channel conditions. This shows that UVoW is a promising wireless system supporting uncompressed HD video.","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.61","startPage":"243","endPage":"248","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446359.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support of Uncompressed Video Streaming Over 60GHz Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Support of Uncompressed Video Streaming Over 60GHz Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446359/","accessionNumber":"9795958","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446359/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support of Uncompressed Video Streaming Over 60GHz Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"TP1-S4-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054704S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4446391,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Lin","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279366400"},{"name":"Takeshi Nakao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Nakao","id":"37942798800"},{"name":"Katsumi Yamashita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsumi","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37268934800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446391","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","OFDM","Degradation","Radio frequency","Autocorrelation","Robustness","Interference","Receivers","Circuits","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","estimation theory","radio receivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint compensation scheme","frequency-selective I/Q imbalance","carrier frequency offset","OFDM-based WLAN","modified periodic pilot","direct-conversion wireless receivers","IEEE 802.11a WLAN","MPP-based scheme","CFO estimation","CFO sign detection","autocorrelation-based estimator"]}],"abstract":"Recently, based on modified periodic pilot (MPP), a compensation scheme for carrier frequency offset (CFO) and I/Q imbalances in direct-conversion wireless receivers, has been proposed. However, it cannot be applied to IEEE 802.11 a WLAN directly, where only periodic pilot (PP) exists. In this paper, the impact of PP on the MPP-based scheme is studied. The results indicate that PP causes fatal degradation of performance, by inducing sign ambiguity in CFO estimation and invalidating the compensation of I/Q imbalances in the absence of CFO. Then, an efficient compensation scheme for the IEEE 802.11 a WLAN is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the CFO estimation is enhanced by a CFO sign detection and an autocorrelation-based estimator. Also, a novel I/Q imbalances compensation algorithm robust to the CFO value is proposed. Taking full advantage of the 802.11 a preamble, the proposed scheme is competent for various scenario of CFO and I/Q imbalances, which is confirmed by simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Compensation of Frequency-Selective I/Q Imbalance and CFO in OFDM-Based WLAN","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.93","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446391.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Compensation of Frequency-Selective I/Q Imbalance and CFO in OFDM-Based WLAN","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446391/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804030","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Compensation of Frequency-Selective I/Q Imbalance and CFO in OFDM-Based WLAN","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FA1-S3-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09672S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4446392,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Jun Ahn","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Chang-Jun","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37269270800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446392","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interferometry","MIMO","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Channel estimation","Signal resolution","Antenna measurements","Power measurement","Base stations","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel estimation","code division multiplexing","interferometry","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high time resolution carrier interferometry","MIMO system","OFDM","channel estimation","multiple transmit antennas","cellular system","channel state information","transmitter antenna","receiver antenna","code division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"In MIMO systems, channel estimation is important to distinguish transmit signals from multiple transmit antennas. When MIMO systems are introduced in cellular systems, we have to measure the received power from all the connectable base station (BS), as well as to identify all the channel state information (CSI) for the combination of transmitter and receiver antenna elements. One of the most typical channel estimation schemes for MIMO in a cellular system is to employ a code division multiplexing (CDM) based scheme in which a unique spreading code is assigned to identify both BS and MS antenna elements. However, by increasing the number of transmit antenna elements, a large spreading code and pilot symbols are required to estimate an accurate CSI. To reduce this problem, in this paper, we propose a high time resolution carrier interferometry (HTRCI) for MIMO/OFDM to achieve an accurate CSI without increasing the number of pilot symbols.","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.94","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446392.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","startPage":"393","endPage":"397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Time Resolution Carrier Interferometry for MIMO/OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High Time Resolution Carrier Interferometry for MIMO/OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446392/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804031","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4446392/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Time Resolution Carrier Interferometry for MIMO/OFDM","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FA1-S3-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044077S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-04"},{"_id":4446393,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

These opportunities and challenges derive from the native advantages and disadvantages of OFDM technology respectively. Too high PAPR is one of the main problems that prevent OFDM from being used more generally in broadband systems. Many approaches such as clipping and filtering, coding, SLM, PTS, and tone reservation have been studied to reduce the peak magnitude of OFDM symbols. In these approaches, tone reservation is considered as one of the most promising methods because of no additional distortion, no side information, and low implementation cost. In this paper, a novel tone reservation scheme is presented. Its essential idea is that a subcarrier selected from all reserved subcarriers for PAPR reduction should have a phase close to one of phi, pi/2+phi, pi+phi and -pi/2+phi, at the peak location in time domain, where phi is the phase of the peak sample. This results in no complex multiplication and division in the novel scheme. In addition, the floating positions of such selected subcarriers in frequency domain are helpful to the convergence of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the scheme can provide good performance and fast convergence.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446393.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"402","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Tone Reservation Scheme with Fast Convergence for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Partial transmit sequences","Time domain analysis","Filtering","Data engineering","Signal design","Wire","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","convergence","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tone reservation scheme","PAPR reduction","OFDM systems","broadband communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","fast convergence","peak-to-average power ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Tone Reservation Scheme with Fast Convergence for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446393/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804032","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Tone Reservation Scheme with Fast Convergence for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FA1-S3-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053853S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4446394,"authors":[{"name":"Poonam Singh","affiliation":["Department of E & ECE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Poonam","lastName":"Singh","id":"37287384900"},{"name":"Saswat Chakrabarti","affiliation":["G.S.Sanyal School of Telecommunications, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Saswat","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37287172900"},{"name":"R.

MSE-OFDM is a bandwidth efficient OFDM scheme, where a number of OFDM symbols are grouped together as a frame and protected by one single cyclic prefix. We wish to explore a multiple access MSE-OFDM, where each symbol of the frame is from a different user. Performance analysis of multi-user MSE-OFDM in AWGN and multipath fading channels has been done and the effects of carrier frequency offset and timing offset on its performance have been studied for downlink channel. The signals from multiple users are assumed to be synchronous in the downlink and the channel conditions are also assumed to be similar for each user. The multiple access interference (MAI) should be minimum if the orthogonality of subcarriers is maintained. However, due to carrier frequency offset and symbol timing misalignment, the orthogonality between users may be destroyed resulting in MAI. The MAI has been analyzed for the proposed scheme and can be reduced by using suitable methods for frequency and time synchronization. Expressions for probability of error for multi-user MSE-OFDM in presence of inter-channel interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) have been derived. Both analysis and simulation results are found to be in close agreement.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446394.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Access Using MSE-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiple access interference","OFDM","AWGN","Timing","Downlink","Interchannel interference","Bandwidth","Protection","Performance analysis","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","AWGN channels","bandwidth allocation","error statistics","fading channels","intersymbol interference","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSE-OFDM","multisymbol encapsulated orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","AWGN channels","multipath fading channels","carrier frequency offset","timing offset","downlink channel","multiple access interference","symbol timing misalignment","time synchronization","frequency synchronization","inter-channel interference","inter-symbol interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Access Using MSE-OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446394/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804033","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Access Using MSE-OFDM","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FA1-S3-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035379S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4446395,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Einhaus","affiliation":["Faculty 6, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Einhaus","id":"37297125800"},{"name":"Ole Klein","affiliation":["Faculty 6, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ole","lastName":"Klein","id":"37702403600"},{"name":"Bernhard Walke","affiliation":["Faculty 6, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Walke","id":"37268354600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446395","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Frequency conversion","Performance analysis","Throughput","Delay","Quality of service","Physical layer","Frequency diversity","Fading","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","discrete event simulation","fading channels","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","performance evaluation","quality of service","resource allocation","scheduling","stochastic processes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA resource scheduling strategy","fair capacity allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","frequency selective fading channel","multiuser channel","performance metrics","quality of service","stochastic event-driven simulation tool","medium access control","network throughput","network delay"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) provides possibilities to exploit diversity of a frequency selective fading channel by appropriate resource scheduling strategies.

Bots typically employ dynamic DNS (DDNS) to locate the respective C&C server. By injecting commands into such servers, botmasters can reuse bots for a variety of attacks. We evaluate two approaches for identifying botnet C&C servers based on anomalous DDNS traffic. The first approach consists in looking for domain names whose query rates are abnormally high or temporally concentrated. High DDNS query rates may be expected because botmasters frequently move C&C servers, and botnets with as many as 1.5 million bots have been discovered. The second approach consists in looking for abnormally recurring DDNS replies indicating that the query is for an inexistent name (NXDOMAIN). Such queries may correspond to bots trying to locate C&C servers that have been taken down. In our experiments, the second approach automatically identified several domain names that were independently reported by others as being suspicious, while the first approach was not as effective.","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.112","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","startPage":"476","endPage":"481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying Botnets Using Anomaly Detection Techniques Applied to DNS Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identifying Botnets Using Anomaly Detection Techniques Applied to DNS Traffic","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446410/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804040","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4446410/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Botnets Using Anomaly Detection Techniques Applied to DNS Traffic","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FA1-S6-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094019S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4446425,"authors":[{"name":"Jelena Mirkovic","affiliation":["ComNets, Faculty 6, RWTH, Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Mirkovic","id":"38242806000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446425","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"abstract":"In this paper, single-user (SU) and multi-user (MU) transmission approaches in multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) wireless local area networks (WLANs) are compared.

In such a situation, which is typical for mobile terminals located near the boundaries of cells with low frequency reuse, transmission schemes with reduced spatial rate including space-time coding (STC) and the cyclic delay diversity (CDD) exhibit improved performance. In this paper, we consider rate-1 downlink transmission for MIMO systems with multi-antenna terminals in use, and focus on the analysis of the receiver performance at the low CIR region (cell boundary). Instead of using the conventional signal detection scheme under the 2-Tx and 2-Rx channel model, we show the effective CIR increases when the spatial demultiplexing (SD) detection is performed under the 4-Tx and 2-Rx model considering the strongest interfering signal as well as the desired signal. Through the evaluation of the effective CIR, the performance improvement at the cell boundary by using this \"intercell SD (ISD)\" which can cancel out or mitigate the strongest interference is demonstrated. It is shown the proposed scheme has the effective CIR gain of 3.04 dB at the cell boundary location.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver Performance Improvement via Intercell Spatial Demultiplexing for Low C/I Terminals in MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.130","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446428.pdf","startPage":"560","endPage":"563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Receiver Performance Improvement via Intercell Spatial Demultiplexing for Low C/I Terminals in MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446428/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9795916","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver Performance Improvement via Intercell Spatial Demultiplexing for Low C/I Terminals in MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FA2-S2-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060378S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4446433,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The result indicates that the proposed systems achieve a better throughput performance than the conventional systems in the whole SNR range. In addition, the simulation result shows that the maximum throughput improvement in each MIMO scheme is respectively about 421 kbps, 545 kbps, and 880 kbps. It is suggested that the effect of the proposed decoding algorithm accordingly gets higher as the number of system antenna increases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.156","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446454.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"681","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of Iterative Decoding Algorithm in the Adaptive Modulation and Coding System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Iterative Decoding Algorithm in the Adaptive Modulation and Coding System","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4446454/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804059","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446454/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Iterative Decoding Algorithm in the Adaptive Modulation and Coding System","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FA2-S6-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055802S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4446470,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Plass","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Plass","id":"37266454000"},{"name":"Armin Dammann","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dammann","id":"37269758600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446470","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Spread spectrum communication","Interference","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Frequency diversity","Degradation","Base stations","Bandwidth","OFDM","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","interference (signal)","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive cellular","cyclic delay diversity","inter-cell interference","multiantenna transmit diversity","cellular transmit diversity","adaptive transmit powers","spread spectrum multicarrier multiple access","multicarrier code division multiple access"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446470","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446470.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Cellular Cyclic Delay Diversity for Multi-Carrier Spread Spectrum Systems","abstract":"The cell border area in a multi-carrier spread spectrum (MC-SS) based system is influenced by large inter-cell interference for a total frequency reuse in the neighboring cells. To handle this inter-cell interference and to enable reliable soft handoff procedures, macro diversity techniques can be applied for these scenarios. Applying multi-antenna transmit diversity techniques in a cellular environment, transmit diversity is transformed to macro diversity. In this paper, the cellular transmit diversity technique based on cyclic delay diversity (CDD), namely cellular CDD (C-CDD), is further investigated in terms of adaptive transmit powers and proper choices of the cyclic delays. The adaption of these system parameters results in a broadened receiving diversity area and eliminates the performance degradation within the standard C-CDD. Further, we show that the use of spread spectrum multi-carrier multiple access (SS-MC-MA) exploits the scarce system resources in a more efficient way with almost the same or better performance compared to the well-known multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4446470/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9811189","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Cellular Cyclic Delay Diversity for Multi-Carrier Spread Spectrum Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Cellular Cyclic Delay Diversity for Multi-Carrier Spread Spectrum Systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"FP1-S2-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052485S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4446476,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Kassab","affiliation":["GET/ENST Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kassab","id":"38336280300"},{"name":"Jean Marie Bonnin","affiliation":["GET/ENST Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean Marie","lastName":"Bonnin","id":"37313112600"},{"name":"Abdelfettah Belghith","firstName":"Abdelfettah","lastName":"Belghith","id":"37322609000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446476","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Delay","Protocols","Costs","Signal analysis","Cryptography","Signal design","Mathematical model","Wireless networks","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication signalling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WLAN","signaling overhead","handover latency","network operators","functional properties","802.11 reauthentication method"]}],"abstract":"Different re-authentication methods have been proposed to reduce the time needed to complete a handover.

In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation in an effort to satisfy the QoS of multiclass services. A power minimization problem is examined for the various data rates and bit-error rate (BER) traffic. Lagrangian relaxation and a subcarrier timesharing factor are used to find an optimal solution. We propose an iterative algorithm to find optimal power consumption and a low complex suboptimal algorithm for practical implementation. The main contribution of this paper is that we apply the optimal solution obtained from the power minimization problem into the proposed algorithms. We execute extensive simulations under various multiclass service scenarios. These scenarios provide a more complete assessment of the proposed algorithms. Simulations results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform in total transmit power consumption compared to existing resource allocation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.211","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","startPage":"907","endPage":"911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiclass Services in Multiuser OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiclass Services in Multiuser OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9811198","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4446509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Multiclass Services in Multiuser OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SA2-BWA-2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059913S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4446511,"authors":[{"name":"Woonsik Lee","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Woonsik","lastName":"Lee","id":"37291453200"},{"name":"Minh-Viet Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Minh-Viet","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37301623600"},{"name":"Jeonghan Jeong","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeonghan","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37070851000"},{"name":"Byungjik Keum","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Byungjik","lastName":"Keum","id":"37570356400"},{"name":"Hwang Soo Lee","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hwang Soo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292593600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446511","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Degradation","Robustness","Radio spectrum management","Throughput","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal resource allocation algorithm","OFDMA","relays","inter-cell interference","performance degradation","cell-edge mobile stations","cellular wireless system architecture","system-level simulator","data throughput","next generation wireless communication","frequency reuse factor","multi-cell/multi-user environment"]}],"abstract":"For the next generation wireless communication systems, inter-cell interference (ICI) is the main source of performance degradation in mobile stations, especially, cell-edge mobile stations.

By using relays to cover the cell-edge areas and a robust algorithm with priority resource allocation, the ICI of the system is significantly reduced, while the sector frequency reuse factor is maintained at 1. A system-level simulator is developed in a multi-cell/multi-user environment, where the effect of the proposed ORAA can be evaluated precisely in the presence of inter-cell interference (ICI).

This paper is motivated by the need to account for challenging constraints that naturally arise in such applications such as channel model uncertainties and demanding sensitivity constraints of the sensing devices. We propose false discovery rate (FDR) based cooperative strategies to sense the occupancy of the spectrum. The strategies we propose could either be used to maximize bandwidth utilization or to provide guarantees on incurred interference levels. The proposed strategies are robust to significant uncertainties such as lack of CSI, fading and shadowing effects. The key idea of the paper is that the twin objectives of bandwidth utilization and interference control can significantly benefit from group testing across all channels in contrast to conventionally employed channel-by-channel detection strategy. Furthermore, it is shown that the cooperative sensing strategy significantly reduces sensitivity requirements. We quantify the effect of channel occupancy rate on the required cooperation degree for achieving a guaranteed level of primary user protection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446520/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9804097","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446520/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On Throughput Maximization and Interference Avoidance in Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Throughput Maximization and Interference Avoidance in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SP2-CRN-1-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047952S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4446521,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Han Lee","affiliation":["Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Chia-Han","lastName":"Lee","id":"37423045400"},{"name":"Wayne Wolf","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37284351200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446521","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":803},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Cognitive radio","Voting","Broadcasting","Proposals","Error analysis","Radio spectrum management","Interference","Matched filters","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radios","energy-efficient techniques","voting scheme","transmission energy","cluster-collect-forward scheme","information exchange","information propagation","broadcasting scheme"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes two energy-efficient techniques suitable for cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radios. Cooperative spectrum sensing collects information from different users to make final decisions. The simplest information to be collected is the decision of each user, and this method is analogous to voting. First of all, we propose a voting scheme based on users' own confidence. Users vote only when they are confident about their spectrum sensing results. Simulation results show that about 10% to 40% of transmission energy can be saved compared to traditional voting schemes. Secondly, we propose a cluster-collect-forward scheme to save energy spent on vote-collection and information exchange. This scheme relies on clustering for vote-collection, and combing and forwarding for information propagation. Our scheme shows significant energy saving from 65% to over 95% compared to the broadcasting scheme. Besides, the processing time is only about half of the broadcasting scheme. Finally, these two proposed techniques can be easily combined to further improve the overall performance.","doi":"10.1109/ccnc08.2007.223","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446297/4446298/04446521.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ccnc08.2007.223","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"968","endPage":"972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Techniques for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Techniques for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446521/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9804098","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Techniques for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SP2-CRN-1-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043094S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4446522,"authors":[{"name":"Faheem Sheikh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Faheem","lastName":"Sheikh","id":"37663950400"},{"name":"Benny Bing","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Benny","lastName":"Bing","id":"37275316400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446522","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":611},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Cognitive radio","Signal processing","Channel bank filters","Frequency domain analysis","Detectors","Computational complexity","History","Testing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","discrete Fourier transforms","filtering theory","probability","signal processing","spectral analysis","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive spectrum sensing","cognitive spectrum detection","polyphase DFT filter bank","signal processing","active channels","unlicensed frequency bands","prolate window filter","frequency domain power detection","cognitive radio network","IEEE 802.22 standard","detection probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a computationally efficient, signal processing scheme to simultaneously sense and detect multiple active channels for a cognitive radio operating in licensed and unlicensed frequency bands.

As the interference and noise characteristics change, the radio should be able to select a waveform optimal for a particular scenario. However, more frequent adaptation requires more frequent distribution of radio parameters, increasing the overhead and decreasing available proportion of capacity for transmitting data. This paper presents a basic model for analyzing modulation adaption overhead in a point-to-point cognitive radio link, and simulates a few specific cases of interest. We examine how quickly a radio can adapt without that overhead actually causing worse overall performance. Our major results are as follows: to decrease overhead cognitive engines should be placed at receivers, not transmitters; modulation adaptation in Rayleigh fading environments is only beneficial under high-SNR conditions; the higher the average SNR, the more frequently we can adapt to fading channels and see rate gains; and adaptation to interference channels offers a significant performance gain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446529/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9804116","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446529/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaption Overhead in Time-Varying Cognitive Radio Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaption Overhead in Time-Varying Cognitive Radio Channels","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"SP3-CRN-2-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057139S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4446297","isNumber":"4446298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446297","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4446298","articleId":"4446529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4446530,"authors":[{"name":"Mai Vu","affiliation":["Harvard University Medical School, USA"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Vu","id":"37268913400"},{"name":"Natasha Devroye","affiliation":["Harvard University Medical School, USA"],"firstName":"Natasha","lastName":"Devroye","id":"37541445700"},{"name":"Vahid Tarokh","affiliation":["Harvard University Medical School, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Tarokh","id":"37271249900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1456-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1457-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2331-9852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2331-9860"}],"articleNumber":"4446530","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Licenses","TV broadcasting","Protection","Interference constraints","Electronic mail","Frequency measurement","Time measurement","White spaces","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","multi-access systems","probability","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive networks","primary exclusive region","single primary transmitter","primary receiver","outage probability","multiple cognitive user"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a cognitive network in which a single primary transmitter communicates with primary receivers within an area of radius R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</sub>\n, called the primary exclusive region (PER).

The concept at the heart of the collaborative wheelchair assistant (CWA) is to rely on the user's motion planning skills while assisting the maneuvering with flexible path guidance. The user decides where to go and controls the speed (including start and stop), while the system guides the wheelchair along software-defined guide paths. An intuitive path editor allows the user to avoid dangers or obstacles online and to modify the guide paths at will. By using the human sensory and planning systems, no complex sensor processing or artificial decision system is needed, making the system safe, simple, and low-cost.

Using the CWA, the wheelchair user needs little effort from the first trial, while moving efficiently with a conventional wheelchair requires adaptation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446604/","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4446604/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921047","pubMedId":"18403284","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Collaborative Wheelchair System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Collaborative Wheelchair System","sourcePdf":"16tnsre02-zeng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058552S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4483552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4483552","articleId":"4446604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":4446607,"authors":[{"name":"Chunyan Li","affiliation":["Microsystems and BioMEMS Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4481154/4446607/4446607-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunyan Li received the B.S. degree in electronics and computer engineering from Yanbian University of Science and Technology, Jilin, China, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, in 2004.

The overall reconstruction framework takes into consideration missing projection data which are not detected due to motion, and additionally, incorporates information from all detected events, including those which fall outside the field-of-view following motion correction.

While most reported EWOD chips use a series of electrode pads essentially in 1D line pattern designed for specific tasks, the desired universal chips allowing user-reconfigurable paths would require the electrode pads in 2D pattern. However, to electrically access the electrode pads independently, conductive lines need to be fabricated underneath the pads in multiple layers, raising a cost issue particularly for disposable chip applications. In this paper, we report the building of digital microfluidic plates based on a printed circuit board (PCB), in which multilayer electrical access lines were created inexpensively using the mature PCB technology. However, due to its surface topography and roughness and resulting high resistance against droplet movement, the as-fabricated PCB surfaces require high (~500 V) voltages unless coated with or immersed in oil. Our goal is the EWOD operations of droplets not only on oil-covered surfaces but also on dry ones.

This may put them at risk and cause their families much worry. The goal of this study is to use information technology to enhance the professional judgment of caregivers, strengthen internal safety monitoring at care organizations, and improve the quality of care for dementia patients. An eXtensible-Markup-Language-based dementia assessment system combining program code and assessment content is used to provide caregivers with better flexibility and real-time response ability. Beyond establishing long-term case files, the system can also perform data consistency analysis, strengthen caregiverspsila continuing education, improve caregiverspsila case judgment skills, and reduce the incidence of accidents due to neglect. This study also applies radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to the development of an indoor and outdoor active safety monitoring mechanism. The system can automatically remind caregivers whenever an elderly person approaches a dangerous area or strays too far. Apart from the use of different size tags, the realization of the system also employs the tame transformation signatures (TTS) algorithm to encrypt tag IDs and protect personal privacy. Clinical testing of the system showed that the indoor RFID reader has a response time of 0.5 s when sensing 40 tags, while the outdoor reader has a sensing time of approximately 5 s due to the need to save power. In the latter case, the system can ensure that elderly patients stay less than 15 m away from their caregivers. Patients were relatively willing to wear light tags. We also found that irritable patients with strong mobility were less compliant and often removed their own tags. Caregivers must provide active care and adopt various safety measures to protect the type of patients.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10185875","htmlLink":"/document/4446659/","pubMedId":"18779072","displayDocTitle":"A Healthcare Integration System for Disease Assessment and Safety Monitoring of Dementia Patients","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Healthcare Integration System for Disease Assessment and Safety Monitoring of Dementia Patients","sourcePdf":"12titb05-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065796S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"4618643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4618643","articleId":"4446659","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4446661,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Yuan Chou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4459763/4446661/4446661-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ta-Yuan Chou received the B.S. degree in information engineering and computer science from Feng-Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1999.

Epoxy nanocomposite samples with a good dispersion of nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix were prepared and experiments were performed to measure the dielectric permittivity and tan delta (400 Hz-1 MHz), dc volume resistivity and ac dielectric strength. At very low nanoparticle loadings, results demonstrate some interesting dielectric behaviors for nanocomposites and some of the electrical properties are found to be unique and advantageous for use in several existing and potential electrical systems. The nanocomposite dielectric properties are analyzed in detail with respect to different experimental parameters like frequency (for permittivity/tan delta), filler size, filler concentration and filler permittivity. In addition, epoxy microcomposites for the same systems were synthesized and their dielectric properties were compared to the results already obtained for nanocomposites. The interesting dielectric characteristics for epoxy based nanodielectric systems are attributed to the large volume fraction of interfaces in the bulk of the material and the ensuing interactions between the charged nanoparticle surface and the epoxy chains.","doi":"10.1109/T-DEI.2008.4446732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4446727/04446732.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-DEI.2008.4446732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446732/","publicationDate":"February 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9768531","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446732/","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites","sourcePdf":"p0012-singha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109768S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4446727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"462","xplore-issue":"4446727","articleId":"4446732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":4446734,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshinobu Murakami","affiliation":["Department of Electric and Electronic Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/4446727/4446734/4446734-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yoshinobu Murakami was born in Kitakyusyu, Japan in 1974.

No marked space charge accumulation was observed in LDPE/MgO nanocomposite films. To determine the mechanism of no space charge accumulation in the LDPE/MgO nanocomposite film, we compared electric potential wells produced by a permanent dipole moment such as that of carbonyl groups (C=0) and an induced dipole consisting of MgO nanoparticles (spherical dielectrics) under a high electric field to create a trapping site for electric charge carriers. The trapping depth created by the permanent dipole moment such as that of the carbonyl groups (C=0) of chemical defects is approximately 0.45 eV. However, the potential well induced by high-permittivity dielectric nanoparticles (MgO) is about 1.5 to 5.0 eV, which is much deeper than that induced by chemical defects.

The hydrophobic properties of the epoxy nanocomposite material were analyzed through contact angle and diffusion coefficient measurements. Fractal dimension were calculated by adopting a multi resolution signal decomposition (MRSD) to the 1D-AFM signal through power spectral density calculations at each level of decomposition. 2D-MRSD studies were applied to AFM pictures to understand the surface characteristics of the material. The result of the study shows the presence of high and low frequency signals indicating characteristic variation in surface roughness of the material. The surface roughness parameter measured through the MRSD technique indicates that the surface roughness is lower for epoxy nanocomposites (upto 5Wt%) compared to pure epoxy resin. It is observed that the fractal dimension and the root mean square roughness values vary proportionately. Also it is realized that diffusion coefficient and surface roughness of the material shows an inverse relationship.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the hydrophobic characteristics of epoxy nanocomposites using wavelets and fractal technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/T-DEI.2008.4446749","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4446727/04446749.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-DEI.2008.4446749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446727","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the hydrophobic characteristics of epoxy nanocomposites using wavelets and fractal technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4446749/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","publicationDate":"February 2008","accessionNumber":"9768542","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the hydrophobic characteristics of epoxy nanocomposites using wavelets and fractal technique","sourcePdf":"p0178-sarathi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073085S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4446727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4446727","articleId":"4446749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4446767,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Buonomo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Napoli, Cosenza, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4446767/4446767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Buonomo (M'83) was born in Cardito, Napoli, Italy, in 1949.

Comparator thermal noise is, however, a limiting factor for the achievable resolution of several ADC architectures with scaled supply voltages. While mismatch in these comparators can be compensated for by calibration, noise can irreparably hinder performance and is less straightforward to be accounted for at design time. This paper presents a method to estimate the input referred noise in fully dynamic regenerative comparators leveraging a reference architecture. A time-domain analysis is proposed that accounts for the time varying nature of the circuit exploiting some basic results from the solution of stochastic differential equations. The resulting symbolic expressions allow focusing designers' attention on the most influential noise contributors. Analysis results are validated by comparison with electrical simulations and measurement results from two ADC prototypes based on the reference comparator architecture, implemented in 0.18-mum and 90-nm CMOS technologies.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.917991","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4563499/04446769.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.917991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Analysis of Regenerative Comparators for Reconfigurable ADC Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Noise Analysis of Regenerative Comparators for Reconfigurable ADC Architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446769/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10117092","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446769/","volume":"55","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Analysis of Regenerative Comparators for Reconfigurable ADC Architectures","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-nuzzo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079693S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"4563499","articleId":"4446769","onlineDate":"07 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4446770,"authors":[{"name":"Tadeusz Tomczak","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Institute of Computers, Control, and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4446770/4446770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tadeusz Tomczak received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science all from the Institute of Computers, Control, and Robotics, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","He is with Wroclaw University of Technology.

To improve the efficiency of this operation, it is desirable to use an adder with good performance and area tradeoff characteristics. This paper presents an efficient carry-lookahead adder architecture based on the parallel-prefix computation graph. In our proposed method, we define the notion of triple-carry-operator, which computes the generate and propagate signals for a merged block which combines three adjacent blocks. We use this in conjunction with the classic approach of the carry-operator to compute the generate and propagate signals for a merged block combining two adjacent blocks. The timing-driven nature of the proposed design reduces the depth of the adder. In addition, we use a ripple-carry type of structure in the nontiming critical portion of the parallel-prefix computation network. These techniques help produce a good timing-area tradeoff characteristic. The experimental results indicate that our proposed adder is significantly faster than the popular Brent-Kung adder with some area overhead. On the adder hand, the proposed adder also shows marginally faster performance than the fast Kogge-Stone adder with significant area savings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446775/","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4446775/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9801810","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Parallel-Prefix Adder Architecture With Efficient Timing-Area Characteristic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Parallel-Prefix Adder Architecture With Efficient Timing-Area Characteristic","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi03-das-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10433S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4453948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4453948","articleId":"4446775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4446776,"authors":[{"name":"Shanq-Jang Ruan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shanq-Jang","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37394866900"},{"name":"Chi-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Yu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37692821600"},{"name":"Jui-Yuan Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jui-Yuan","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"38119857000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4446776","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":961},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446776","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","Energy consumption","CMOS technology","Table lookup","Databases","Computer networks","Concurrent computing","High performance computing","Mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","content-addressable storage","logic design","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable memory","precomputation-based CAM","block-XOR approach","mathematical analysis","Synopsys Nanosim","TSMC CMOS technology","low power design","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content-addressable memory (CAM)","low-power","precomputation"]}],"abstract":"Content-addressable memory (CAM) is frequently used in applications, such as lookup tables, databases, associative computing, and networking, that require high-speed searches due to its ability to improve application performance by using parallel comparison to reduce search time. Although the use of parallel comparison results in reduced search time, it also significantly increases power consumption. In this paper, we propose a Block-xor approach to improve the efficiency of low power precomputation-based CAM (PB-CAM). Through mathematical analysis, we found that our approach can effectively reduce the number of comparison operations by 50% on average as compared with the ones-count approach for 32-bit-long inputs. In our experiment, we used Synopsys Nanosim to estimate the power consumption in TSMC 0.35-mum CMOS technology. Compared with the ones-count PB-CAM system, the experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve on average 30% in power reduction and 32% in power performance reduction. The major contribution of this paper is that it presents theoretical and practical proofs to verify that our proposed Block-xor PB-CAM system can achieve greater power reduction without the need for a special CAM cell design. This implies that our approach is more flexible and adaptive for general designs.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.915514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.915514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4453948/04446776.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4453948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power Design of Precomputation-Based Content-Addressable Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Low Power Design of Precomputation-Based Content-Addressable Memory","volume":"16","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9783937","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446776/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power Design of Precomputation-Based Content-Addressable Memory","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi03-ruan-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043785S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4453948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4453948","articleId":"4446776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4446777,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Wu","affiliation":["Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4453948/4446777/4446777-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaofeng Wu received the B.Eng. degree in space engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 1998, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K., in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K., in 2005.","Currently, he is a Research Fellow with Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K. from 1998 to 2000, he was an R&D Engineer with the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology.

For this reason, the proposed processor has a very small silicon footprint and runs at very high frequencies making it ideal for high-sampling rate, real-time control applications. A number of DeltaSigma -CSP configurations have been implemented as VLSI hard macros in a high-performance 0.13-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mu</i>\nm CMOS process and a particular configuration achieved a post-route operating frequency of 355 MHz resulting in a 2.17 MHz sampling rate for a fourth-order control law implementation. Additional results prove that the DeltaSigma -CSP compares very favorably, in terms of silicon area and sampling rates, to two other specialized digital control processing systems, including direct, hardwired implementation of control laws; at the same time, it substantially outperforms software implementations of control laws running on very wide, general-purpose VLIW architectures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel - Control System Processor and Its VLSI Implementation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.915396","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4453948/04446777.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.915396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4453948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446777/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Delta\\Sigma$</tex> </formula> Control System Processor and Its VLSI Implementation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4446777/","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9783940","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Delta\\Sigma$</tex> </formula> Control System Processor and Its VLSI Implementation","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi03-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066732S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4453948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4453948","articleId":"4446777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4446804,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Purdy","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Matthew Purdy is the manager of the APC Technology development organization for AMD.

Current practice is to represent the number of defects caught by an inspection tool by either a binomial random variable or by a fraction of the defects inspected. Models based on these principles merely use the mean capture rate (CR) of the inspection tool to fully characterize the number of defects caught by the inspection tool. The model we developed shows that using only the mean capture rate of the inspection tool does not fully represent the real behavior of the inspection tool. These models completely ignore the second moment properties such as the variance/covariance characteristics of the defect capture process. In this paper we introduce notions of defect-to-defect (DTD), wafer-to-wafer (WTW)and lot-to-lot (LTL) capture rate repeatability that represent the variance/covariance characteristics of the defect capture process in our sample planning model. Our study based on this model shows that the false alarm rate and lots at risk for a given sample plan depend heavily on the capture rate repeatability. Furthermore, the optimal sample plan for a given risk tolerance can be influenced substantially by this repeatability. In this paper we present a new sample planner model that incorporates capture rate repeatability. We define the necessary notions of capture rate repeatability and use them to develop the sample planner model. We present the risk trade-offs, and an algorithm to compute the optimal sample plan for a pre-specified risk level. Finally, we present the numerical results and our analysis of their implications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSM.2007.4446897","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444476/4446780/04446897.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ISSM.2007.4446897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of capture rate and its repeatability on optimal sampling requirements in semiconductor manufacturing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effects of capture rate and its repeatability on optimal sampling requirements in semiconductor manufacturing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4446897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9809645","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446897/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of capture rate and its repeatability on optimal sampling requirements in semiconductor manufacturing","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044278S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444476","isNumber":"4446780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444476","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4446780","articleId":"4446897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4446944,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Said","affiliation":["Sys'com Laboratory, National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Said","id":"37691677100"},{"name":"Houria Rezig","affiliation":["Sys'com Laboratory, National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Houria","lastName":"Rezig","id":"37297132800"},{"name":"Ammar Bouallegue","affiliation":["Sys'com Laboratory, National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ammar","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37285012400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1639-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4446944","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446944","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical fiber networks","High speed optical techniques","Nonlinear optics","Optical signal processing","Optical wavelength conversion","Bit rate","Numerical simulation","Stokes parameters","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear optics","optical modulation","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optical amplifiers","cross-polarization modulation","nonlinear behavior","high bit rate optical networks","numerical simulations","Stokes parameters","ellipticity parameters","bias current","gain dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cross-polarization modulation (XPolM)","nonlinearity","polarization rotation","semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)","stokes parameters"]}],"abstract":"The aim of the present work is to present an analysis of the impact of Semiconductor Optical Amplifier length variation on the cross-polarization modulation (XPolM) effect in the structure.

Each modulation technique has its unique attractive features as well as its challenges. Some are very simple to implement and bandwidth efficient like the on-off keying (OOK). Pulse interval modulation (PIM) techniques are reputed for their inherent synchronisation pulse, subcarrier modulation offers increased throughput, resilience to the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and immunity against the fluorescent-light noise near DC, while pulse position modulation (PPM) provides the unparalleled power efficiency in line of sight (LOS) links but the performance degrades severely in dispersed communication channel.

This project proposes an innovative radio over fiber optical access network architecture, which combines a low cost Base Station (BS) design, incorporating reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers, with fiber dispersion mitigation provided by optical single sideband modulation techniques. Optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) techniques are used to simplify the access network architecture allowing for different Base Stations to be fed by a common fiber. Different wavelength channels can be allocated to different BSs depending on user requirements. Additionally, in order to improve radio coverage within a cell, it is considered a sectorized antenna interface. The combination of subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) with WDM, further simplifies the network architecture, by using a specific wavelength channel to feed an individual BS and different subcarriers to drive the individual antenna sectors within the BS.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical modulation","Stimulated emission","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical design techniques","Base stations","Costs","Optical design","WDM networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","microwave photonics","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre subscriber loops","optical modulation","radio-over-fibre","reconfigurable architectures","semiconductor optical amplifiers","telecommunication network topology","wavelength assignment","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reflective semiconductor optical amplifier","reconfigurable radio-over-fiber network","RoFnet","optical access network architecture","base station design","fiber dispersion mitigation","optical single sideband modulation technique","optical wavelength division multiplexing","wavelength channel allocation","sectorized antenna interface","subcarrier multiplexing","WDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radio over fiber","reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers","optical single side band","optical access networks","wavelength division multiplexing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTONMW.2007.4446986","publicationTitle":"2007 ICTON Mediterranean Winter Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 ICTON Mediterranean Winter Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444773/4446901/04446986.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTONMW.2007.4446986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio over fiber access network architecture employing reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio over fiber access network architecture employing reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446986/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4446986/","accessionNumber":"9833190","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio over fiber access network architecture employing reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058128S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444773","isNumber":"4446901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444773","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4446901","articleId":"4446986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4446987,"authors":[{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"},{"name":"Martin Maier","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Maier","id":"37276422300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1639-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4446987","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards seamless Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks: Convergence and challenges","abstract":"Traditionally, wireless and optical fiber networks have been designed separately from each other. Wireless networks aimed at meeting specific service requirements while coping with particular transmission impairments and optimizing the utilization of the system resources to ensure cost-effectiveness and satisfaction for the end user. In optical networks, on the other hand, research efforts rather focused on cost reduction, simplicity, and future-proofness against legacy and emerging services and applications by means of optical transparency. With the ultimate goal of providing access to information when needed, wherever needed, and in whatever format it is needed, the vision of technological convergence of wireless and optical networks is not only becoming a necessity but also plays a key role in future communications networks. Towards the technical evolution of wireless-optical access networks and the seamless coexistence of both technologies, this paper provides a review of state-of-the-art developments and advances in wireless and optical communications, presents key technical challenges for providing seamless communications in fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks, and highlights important research issues for providing intelligence, transport, access, and convergence of these future networks.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444773/4446901/04446987.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 ICTON Mediterranean Winter Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTONMW.2007.4446987","doi":"10.1109/ICTONMW.2007.4446987","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 ICTON Mediterranean Winter Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446987","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Optical fiber networks","Telecommunication traffic","Wireless networks","Optical fiber communication","Video on demand","MIMO","Wireless communication","Streaming media","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["seamless fiber-wireless access networks","transmission impairments","optical networks","wireless communications","optical communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446987/","displayDocTitle":"Towards seamless Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks: Convergence and challenges","accessionNumber":"9809197","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4446987/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards seamless Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks: Convergence and challenges","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060405S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444773","isNumber":"4446901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444773","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4446901","articleId":"4446987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4446990,"authors":[{"name":"Shubham Agrawal","affiliation":["Operations Research and Industrial Engineering Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Cockrell School of Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4459763/4446990/4446990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shubham Agrawal was born in Varanasi, India, on April 29, 1985.

Pareto dominance is adopted as the criterion to evaluate the particles found along the search process. Nondominated particles are stored in an external repository which updates continuously through the adaptive-grid mechanism proposed. The approach is further strengthened by the incorporation of a self-adaptive mutation operator. A decision maker (DM) is provided with the knowledge of an approximate Pareto optimal front, and his/her preference articulations are used to derive a utility function intended to calculate the utility of the existing and upcoming solutions. The incubation of particle-swarm mechanism for the MOO by incorporating an adaptive-grid mechanism, a self-adaptive mutation operator, and a novel decision-making strategy makes it a novel and efficient approach. Simulation results on various test functions indicate that the proposed metaheuristic identifies not only the best preferred solution with a greater accuracy but also presents a uniformly diverse high utility Pareto front without putting excessive cognitive load on the DM. The practical relevance of the proposed strategy is very high in the cases that involve the simultaneous use of decision making and availability of highly favored alternatives.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913728","htmlLink":"/document/4446990/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Particle Swarm: A Pareto-Adaptive Metaheuristic to Multiobjective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Particle Swarm: A Pareto-Adaptive Metaheuristic to Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"38tsmca02-agrawal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088386S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4459763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4459763","articleId":"4446990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4446991,"authors":[{"name":"Julius S.

The algorithm finds filter coefficients with reduced number of signed-power-of-two (SPT) terms given the filter frequency response characteristics. The algorithm is a branch-and-bound-based algorithm that fixes a coefficient to a certain value. The value is determined by finding the boundary values of the coefficient using linear programming. Although the worst case run time of the algorithm is exponential, its capability to find appreciably good solutions in a reasonable amount of time makes it a desirable CAD tool for designing low-power and hardware-efficient filters. The superiority of the algorithm on existing methods in terms of SPT term count, design time, hardware complexity, and power performance is shown with several design examples. Up to 30% reduction in the number of SPT terms is achieved over unoptimized Remez coefficients, which is 20% better than compared optimization methods. The average power saving is 20% over unoptimized coefficients, which is up to 14% better than optimized coefficients obtained with existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.917997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4563499/04446999.pdf","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.917997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for the Design of Low-Power Hardware-Efficient FIR Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4446999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4446999/","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for the Design of Low-Power Hardware-Efficient FIR Filters","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117087","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for the Design of Low-Power Hardware-Efficient FIR Filters","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-aktan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109258S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"67","articleId":"4446999","onlineDate":"07 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4447002,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Bates","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4599140/4447002/4447002-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stephen Bates (S'94\u2013M'03\u2013SM'06) received the Ph.D. degree from Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1997.","He then joined Massana, an Irish Fabless Semiconductor company specializing in high-speed Ethernet transceiver design.

One of these problems is the implementation of the coarse quantizer with an array of voltage comparators. This work presents a novel architecture of multibit continuous-time sigma-delta modulator that employs a time encoding quantizer and irregular sampling instead of a flash analog-to-digital converter. The time-encoding quantizer is based in a modulated oscillator that produces a two-level signal. A digital decoder converts the binary signal into an irregularly sampled multibit signal that is interpolated and fed back into the loop filter of the sigma-delta modulator. This architecture is especially adequate for low-voltage technologies due to the absence of a resistive reference ladder in the quantizer and may permit a significant reduction of the complexity of the existing continuous-time sigma-delta modulators.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog-to-digital conversion using noise shaping and time encoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918003","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4599140/04447003.pdf","startPage":"2026","endPage":"2037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Analog-to-digital conversion using noise shaping and time encoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145753","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog-to-digital conversion using noise shaping and time encoding","sourcePdf":"55tcsi07-hernandez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02846S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4599140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4447003","onlineDate":"07 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4447004,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Raman","affiliation":["University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4447004/4447004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Johan Raman (M'99) was born in Ghent, Belgium, in 1970.

While being applied initially for purely electrical A/D converters, its application has been expanded to mixed mechanical-electrical systems. This has led to the use of SigmaDelta force-feedback for digital readout of high-performance inertial sensors. However, compared with their electrical counterpoint, SigmaDelta force-feedback loops often have to deal with three additional issues: 1) an increased stability problem due to phase-lag occurring in the sensor; 2) the injection of relatively high levels of readout noise in the loop; and 3) the lack of degrees-of-freedom of many SigmaDelta force-feedback architectures for implementing an arbitrary noise transfer function. As a result, SigmaDelta force-feedback loops found in literature are designed in a much less systematic way as compared with electrical SigmaDelta modulators. In this paper, we address these issues and propose a new unconstrained architecture. Based on this architecture, we are able to present a systematic approach for designing SigmaDelta force-feedback loops. Additionally, the main strengths and weaknesses of different SigmaDelta force-feedback architectures are discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Sensor systems","Micromechanical devices","Mechanical sensors","Stability","Noise level","Phase noise","Feedback circuits","Bandwidth","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital readout","sigma-delta modulation","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconstrained architecture","systematic design","SigmaDelta force-feedback loops","SigmaDelta-modulation","analog-to-digital conversion","A-D conversion","mixed mechanical-electrical systems","digital readout","high-performance inertial sensors","arbitrary noise transfer function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["A/D-conversion","force-feedback","MEMS inertial sensors","sigma-delta  $(\\Sigma\\Delta)$ modulation","systematic design"]},{"kwd":["Sigma-Delta modulation","force-feedback","MEMS inertial sensors","A/D-conversion","systematic design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447004","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.917998","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4563499/04447004.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.917998","startPage":"1601","endPage":"1614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Unconstrained Architecture for Systematic Design of Higher Order - Force-Feedback Loops","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Unconstrained Architecture for Systematic Design of Higher Order <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma\\Delta$</tex></formula> Force-Feedback Loops","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447004/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4447004/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117089","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Unconstrained Architecture for Systematic Design of Higher Order <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma\\Delta$</tex></formula> Force-Feedback Loops","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-raman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106726S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4563499","articleId":"4447004","onlineDate":"07 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4447006,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Shu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4447006/4447006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Shu received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2005.

We show that the overall THD in these closed-loop CDAs comprises the THD of their open-loop counterparts reduced by the Loop Gain+1 and the THD due to the combined phase and duty cycle error that is due to feedback, hence unique to closed-loop CDAs. We show that the latter THD can be large and is the dominant THD at high input frequencies ( > 3 kHz), and that the mechanisms therein are the phase and duty cycle errors. By means of double Fourier series analysis, analytical expressions for the harmonic components and thereafter a THD expression for closed-loop CDAs are derived. The derived expressions depict the parameters that affect THD, and are insightful to designers to optimize/vary pertinent parameters to reduce THD. The derived THD expression is verified against HSPICE and on the basis of measurements on a prototype CDA IC and other CDAs realized discretely.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THD of Closed-Loop Analog PWM Class-D Amplifiers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918000","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4563499/04447006.pdf","startPage":"1769","endPage":"1777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"THD of Closed-Loop Analog PWM Class-D Amplifiers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4447006/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117090","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"THD of Closed-Loop Analog PWM Class-D Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-shu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065572S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4563499","articleId":"4447006","onlineDate":"07 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4447007,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejin Wang","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4599140/4447007/4447007-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuejin Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

To reduce the severe performance degradation of the traditional antenna selection schemes in correlated channels, a new scheme which employ joint antenna selection (JAS) at both link ends algorithm and embed DWT operations in the receiver-end RF chains is proposed. Through extensive simulations it is demonstrated that the proposed DWT-based joint antenna selection has significant improvement of the capacity for both i.i.d and correlated MIMO channels, while requiring only a minor hardware overhead and low computational complexity for the DWT operations. Moreover, it is shown that the capacity associated with DWT-based JAS is higher than the system employing DWT-based receive antenna selection (RAS) only.

Code division multiple access (CDMA) system capacity as an interference limited capacity performance is mainly affected by the out of-cell interference. While the in-cell interference is controlled within each cell using power control algorithms, the out of -cell interference is not, and may impact network coverage and the total user capacity. One approach used to enhance users' quality of service, increase the system capacity, and widen the system coverage is to use cells of different radii, hierarchically organized in overlapping layers, this is known as multitier system. In this paper the system capacity in the uplink direction of a certain two-tier CDMA system consisting of two cells operating at the same frequency band is examined. A fast/slow mobility profile is used to study the effect of the users' mobility on the call blocking and call dropping probability for a Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)-based uplink admission control scheme. Two schemes for uplink capacity calculation are utilized. For the first scheme, to have a non negative solution of the received powers of current active users, i.e., feasible solution, a randomly selected user(s) is(are) dropped. For the second scheme, the user with highest amount of interference is dropped regardless of the cell membership. Computer simulation results show that, for the second scheme, the system capacity increased roughly by about 8 % over the first scheme and the dropping probability is 50 % less than that of the first scheme. The dominant parameters affecting the system performance are the users' velocity, new users' arrival rate, and the distance between the two cells.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2007.4447071","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4447008/4447009/04447071.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2007.4447071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIR-based uplink admission scheme for a two-tier CDMA system under mobility incorporation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447071/","displayDocTitle":"SIR-based uplink admission scheme for a two-tier CDMA system under mobility incorporation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9809118","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447071/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIR-based uplink admission scheme for a two-tier CDMA system under mobility incorporation","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073017S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4447008","isNumber":"4447009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447008","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4447009","articleId":"4447071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447074,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Toscher","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile Systems, Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Toscher","id":"37427684000"},{"name":"Roland Kasper","affiliation":["Institute of Mobile Systems, Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Kasper","id":"37425151300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1365-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4447074","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"abstract":"Field programmable gate arrays provide an excellent opportunity to implement drive control functionalities in a highly flexible environment.

However, lack of frequency diversity makes it vulnerable to frequency selective impairments such as narrowband interference, frequency selective fading, frequency dependent attenuations etc. In this work, we describe a novel Adaptive Weighting (AW) technique as an efficient method to improve the BER performance of grouped linear constellation preceding (GLCP) OFDM which is used to achieve frequency diversity. In this method during maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD), the distance of the possible constellation points from the received symbols are weighted according to the SNR of each subcarrier before the sequence with the minimum distance is chosen.

It is a well known fact that the knowledge of the exact tap delay locations enables the construction of the modified least square [m-LS] estimator, which happens to be the best linear unbiased estimator [BLUE].Inherent frailties such as high condition number of the linear transformation matrix and the consequent high noise sensitivity ensures that the m-LS estimator often performs poorly at low to moderate SNRs. This motivates the usage of certain biased estimators which attack these short comings of the least square estimator. We propose two biased channel estimators, derived from the rank shaped least squares [RSLS] estimator and the generalised Liu [GL] estimator to attain superior performance. The simulation results involving downlink channel estimation in WiMAX systems vindicate the usage of the above mentioned estimators.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447156","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444357/4447146/04447156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447146","startPage":"30","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of Biased Estimators for Improved Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Use of Biased Estimators for Improved Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447156/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9766111","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4447156/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Biased Estimators for Improved Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN08-00-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081562S","chronDate":"4-6 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4444357","isNumber":"4447146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444357","xplore-issue":"4447146","articleId":"4447156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4447157,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Dalwadi","affiliation":["Reliance Technology Innovation Center, Reliance Communications Limited, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Dalwadi","id":"38132712700"},{"name":"Brijesh I.

Based on architecture-aware LDPC codes, this paper presents an efficient joint LDPC coding and decoding hardware architecture. We used a special class of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes, which have an efficient encoding algorithm due to the simple structure of their parity-check matrices. Since the parity-check matrix of a QC-LDPC code consists of circulant permutation matrices or the zero matrix, the required memory for storing it can be significantly reduced, as compared with randomly constructed LDPC codes. An encoder and a decoder are designed using Verilog-HDL and are synthesized using synopsys design compiler with ISO nm TSMC standard cell library. We used CORDIC algorithm to implement check node update unit in decoder which saves much hardware compared to conventional LUT approach. We study the optimal permutation of the bit nodes that will result in the maximum possible burst erasure correction capability for a given LDPC code.

Currently, many NIDSs that are developed are rule-based systems and their performances mainly depend on the rule sets. But rules formation becomes a tedious and rime consuming task due to the enormous amount of network traffic. This is overcome by using data mining techniques. These techniques build intrusion detection models adaptively. Random forests is an efficient data mining algorithm which can be used for network intrusion detection This can be used for real time intrusion detection.

Designing efficient equalisers having low structural complexity and faster learning algorithms is also an area of much research interest in the present scenario. This research work proposes adaptive channel equalisation techniques on Recurrent Neural Network framework. Exhaustive simulation studies carried out prove that by replacing the conventional sigmoid activation functions in each of the processing nodes of recurrent neural network with multilevel sigmoid activation functions, the bit error rate performance have significantly improved. Further slopes of different levels of the multi-level sigmoid have been adapted using fuzzy logic control concept Simulation results cosidering standard channel models show faster learning with less number of training samples and performance level comparable to the their conventional counterparts. Also there is scope for parallel implementation of slope adaptation technique in real-time implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Adaptive Channel Equaliser on Neural Framework Using Fuzzy Logic Based Multilevel Sigmoid Slope Adaptation","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447203","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444357/4447146/04447203.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of Adaptive Channel Equaliser on Neural Framework Using Fuzzy Logic Based Multilevel Sigmoid Slope Adaptation","conferenceDate":"4-6 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447203/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9766157","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Adaptive Channel Equaliser on Neural Framework Using Fuzzy Logic Based Multilevel Sigmoid Slope Adaptation","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN08-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053328S","chronDate":"4-6 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4444357","isNumber":"4447146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4447146","articleId":"4447203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4447209,"authors":[{"name":"K.

When using conventional finite-impulse response (FIR) filters as building blocks for generating these FBs, this implies that their orders become very high, thereby resulting in a high overall arithmetic complexity. For considerably reducing the overall complexity, this contribution exploits the frequency-response masking (FRM) technique for synthesizing FIR filters for the above-mentioned FBs, where rational sampling factors are used. Comparisons between various optional methods of utilizing the FRM technique for designing FBs under consideration shows that the most efficient one, from both the design and the implementation viewpoints, are FBs that are constructed such that the bandedge-shaping or periodic filters are evaluated at the input sampling rate and the masking filters at the output sampling rate. This is shown by means of illustrative examples.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Sampling methods","Signal processing","Bandwidth","Signal sampling","Laboratories","Arithmetic","Frequency synthesizers","Digital filters","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-response masking-based design","FIR filterbanks","rational sampling factors","finite-impulse response filters","bandedge-shaping","periodic filters","masking filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-response masking (FRM) technique","nonuniform filterbanks (FBs)","rational sampling rate conversion","two-channel FBs"]},{"kwd":["Frequency-response masking technique","two-channel filterbanks","nonuniform filterbanks","rational sampling rate conversion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4599140/04447242.pdf","startPage":"2002","endPage":"2012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Response Masking-Based Design of Nearly Perfect-Reconstruction Two-Channel FIR Filterbanks With Rational Sampling Factors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Response Masking-Based Design of Nearly Perfect-Reconstruction Two-Channel FIR Filterbanks With Rational Sampling Factors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447242/","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447242/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10145757","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Response Masking-Based Design of Nearly Perfect-Reconstruction Two-Channel FIR Filterbanks With Rational Sampling Factors","sourcePdf":"55tcsi07-bregovic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074197S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4599140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4599140","articleId":"4447242","onlineDate":"07 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4447244,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Yu Peng","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4599140/4447244/4447244-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng-Yu Peng (S'02) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1995 and 1997 respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2004.

The circuit is composed of a capacitive feedback charge amplifier and a charge adaptation circuit. Without the adaptation circuit, the charge amplifier only consumes 1 muW to achieve the audio band SNR of 69.34 dB. An adaptation scheme using Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and channel hot-electron injection mechanisms to stabilize the dc output voltage is demonstrated. This scheme provides a very low frequency pole at 0.2 Hz. The measured noise spectrums show that this slow-time scale adaptation does not degrade the circuit performance.

Two circuits will be demonstrated; the first is a rise time measurement core, while the second represents an embedded technique for the characterization of narrow pulses. Both circuits can be seen as general tools to increase the low-end time dynamic range measurements of digital events in CMOS. The circuits rely on a new fast voltage-crossing detector to convert the input information and condition it into same polarity edges, separated by the timing information to be measured. Those edges are then in turn stretched further using time amplification, making them easily detectable with low-resolution time-to-digital converters. Dynamic current generation techniques are used in the front-end detector to greatly reduce the power consumption. The proposed circuits are compact and introduce only a few tens of femtofarads capacitive loading. The circuits were implemented in a standard 0.18-mum CMOS process. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach. Rise times of 1 ns and pulses as narrow as 78 ps were successfully captured in a single-shot measurement approach, with total power dissipation not exceeding a few milliwatts, in each of the two cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","volume":"55","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"10145767","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447245/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Embedded Measurement of GHz Digital Signals With Time Amplification in CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded Measurement of GHz Digital Signals With Time Amplification in CMOS","sourcePdf":"55tcsi07-safiharb.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061388S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4599140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4599140","articleId":"4447245","onlineDate":"07 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447297,"authors":[{"name":"Duane S.

The proposed method calculates a reliance index (RI) value between zero and one by analyzing the process data of production equipment to determine the reliability of the virtual metrology results. This method also defines an RI threshold. If an RI value exceeds the threshold, the conjecture result is reliable; otherwise, the conjecture result needs to be further examined. Besides the RI, the method also proposes process data similarity indexes (SIs). The SIs are defined to assess the degree of similarity between the input set of process data and those historical sets of process data used to establish the conjecture model. The proposed method includes two types of SIs: global similarity index (GSI) and individual similarity index (ISI).

A new gate leakage monitor structure is developed to obtain device-specific gate leakage characteristics of the SRAM cells. This allows us to explore the design space accurately with reliable process information at an early stage. By relying on supply voltage-dependent analysis, it is shown that the gate-leakage impact on the cell yield can be nonmonotonic and substantial even for nondefective devices. It is also shown that design optimizations such as increased operating voltages or shorter hierarchical bitline architecture can help alleviate the gate-leakage impact on yield. Mixture importance sampling is used to estimate yield in terms of cell writability and stability. Threshold voltage variations to model random fluctuation effects are extrapolated from hardware results.","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2007.913189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4447295/04447305.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2007.913189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Considerations for PD/SOI SRAM: Impact of Gate Leakage and Threshold Voltage Variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447305/","displayDocTitle":"Design Considerations for PD/SOI SRAM: Impact of Gate Leakage and Threshold Voltage Variation","volume":"21","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447305/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9783897","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Considerations for PD/SOI SRAM: Impact of Gate Leakage and Threshold Voltage Variation","sourcePdf":"21tsm01-kanj.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063869S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4447295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4447295","articleId":"4447305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447311,"authors":[{"name":"Smruti R.

This scenario is of interest due to the increasing mobility of wireless devices, and because hallways have previously been reported to create difficulties for MIMO propagation. In this paper we focus on the variation in capacity as a function of position as one side of the wireless link is moved laterally (i.e., vertically and horizontally) in the hallway. We find not only significant degradation in MIMO capacity due to rank collapse, but also identify considerable variability due to changes in the signal strength. The capacity along a vertical cut is found to be relatively constant about 7.5 plusmn 1 bps/Hz for a reference signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB at a range of 12 m, which is significantly less than the ideal maximum of 11.5 bps/Hz. The capacity along a horizontal cut is found to be about 6.7 plusmn 3 bps/Hz under the same conditions, dominated by a large-scale signal strength variation which can be attributed to identifiable propagation mechanisms. We also consider the performance relative to simpler rank-1 (diversity/beamforming) schemes, with and without channel state information.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4447330/04447342.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.915431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.915431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lateral Position Dependence of MIMO Capacity in a Hallway at 2.4 GHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal processing","Array signal processing","Portable computers","Handheld computers","Educational institutions","Ray tracing","Degradation","Signal to noise ratio","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","indoor radio","MIMO communication","radio links","UHF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lateral position dependence","MIMO propagation","wireless link","indoor communication","signal strength variation","channel state information","multiple-input multiple-output system","hallway","MIMO capacity","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor propagation","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Lateral Position Dependence of MIMO Capacity in a Hallway at 2.4 GHz","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4447342/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9794151","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lateral Position Dependence of MIMO Capacity in a Hallway at 2.4 GHz","sourcePdf":"56tap02-ellingson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05479S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4447330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","xplore-issue":"4447330","articleId":"4447342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4447347,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua D.

This paper extends this approach to further determine the optimal antenna characteristics which maximize the capacity for the propagation scenario, with the resulting capacity bound representing the ultimate maximum achievable value if optimal antenna design and signaling are used. In this approach, the spatially-continuous transmit currents and receive fields are represented using eigenfunctions of appropriate operators. It is shown that, except under certain conditions where array supergain solutions emerge, the capacity remains bounded for finite transmit power. The approach also shows how to limit supergain effects using practical constraints.

First, the order conditions for the symplectic integrators are derived. Second, the comparisons of numerical stability, dispersion, and energy-conservation are provided between the high-order symplectic schemes and other high-order time approaches. Finally, these symplectic schemes are studied by using different space and time strategies. According to our survey, high-order time schemes for matching high-order space schemes are required for optimum electromagnetic simulation. Numerical experiments have been conducted on radiation of electric dipole and wideband S-parameter extraction of dielectric-filled waveguide. The results demonstrate that the high-order symplectic scheme can obtain satisfying numerical solutions under high Courant-Friedrichs-Levy number and coarse grid conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.915444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4447330/04447367.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.915444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey on Symplectic Finite-Difference Time-Domain Schemes for Maxwell's Equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447367/","displayDocTitle":"Survey on Symplectic Finite-Difference Time-Domain Schemes for Maxwell's Equations","volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9794172","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447367/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey on Symplectic Finite-Difference Time-Domain Schemes for Maxwell's Equations","sourcePdf":"56tap02-sha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108878S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4447330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4447330","articleId":"4447367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4447368,"authors":[{"name":"Atif Shamim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4447330/4447368/4447368-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Atif Shamim (S'03) received the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2004, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He was an Invited Researcher at the VTT Micromodule Research Center, Oulu, Finland, in 2006, where he worked on completely embedded ferrite LTCC based transformers for material characterization and developed high efficiency antennas by combining regular LTCC with ferrite LTCC.

We derive closed analytical formulas for the reflection coefficient, and for the dispersion characteristic of the surfaces waves.

With suitable arrangement of the bias network, the proposed antenna demonstrates reconfigurable radiation patterns in the frequency range from 3.5 to 6.5 GHz in three states: a broadside radiation with fairly omnidirectional pattern and two end-fire radiations whose main beams are directed to exactly opposite directions. The proposed antenna is investigated comprehensively with the help of the radiation patterns in the two principal cuts and also the antenna gain responses versus frequencies. The simulation and measurement results reveal fairly good agreement and hence sustain the reconfigurability of the proposed design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9794177","htmlLink":"/document/4447374/","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband Slotted Bow-Tie Antenna With Reconfigurable CPW-to-Slotline Transition for Pattern Diversity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband Slotted Bow-Tie Antenna With Reconfigurable CPW-to-Slotline Transition for Pattern Diversity","sourcePdf":"56tap02-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051644S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4447330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4447330","articleId":"4447374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4447375,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xu","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4447330/4447375/4447375-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Xu (M'05) was born in Jiangsu, China.

By transforming electromagnetic field variables into new forms of periodic variables, which also can be resolved from the Maxwell's equations, one can convert the 2D transmission line problem into an equivalent resonator problem based on the idea of translating the transmission distance-related attenuation part of complex propagation constant into a time-dependent damping factor. As a result, the FDTD method for resonator can be made use of to simulate the lossy guiding structures. Attenuation constants can be obtained by means of the quality factors of equivalent resonators. It means that some leaky wave antennas can also be analyzed by using this method. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can quickly and accurately extract the phase constants and attenuation constants of lossy guiding structures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

By applying a group of auxiliary sensors in a uniform linear array (ULA), we prove the resiliency of the MUSIC direction finding algorithm against array sensor coupling. We show that the performance of MUSIC algorithm under antenna array with unknown coupling can be very close to the case with known coupling. We can also estimate the mutual coupling coefficients before refining the DOA estimates by utilizing an extended sensor array. Moreover, our analysis on the effect of mutual coupling in direction finding illustrates the existence of some blind angles which should be avoided when the array is designed. Our simulation results corroborate our analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","volume":"56","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9794180","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Resiliency of MUSIC Direction Finding Against Antenna Sensor Coupling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Resiliency of MUSIC Direction Finding Against Antenna Sensor Coupling","sourcePdf":"56tap02-ye.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041921S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","isNumber":"4447330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"111","articleId":"4447377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4447378,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper introduces a first practical implementation of a novel broadband class E power amplifier design combining a parallel-circuit load network with a reactance compensation technique. The novel broadband parallel-circuit class E load network using reactance compensation technique has been discussed based on theory and its experimental verification. A proper guidelines method of designing a high-efficiency broadband class E power amplifier with an LDMOS transistor until the final prototype measurement and optimization will be discussed. In the measurement level, the drain efficiency of 74% at an operating power of 8 W and power flatness of 0.7 dB are achieved across a bandwidth of 136-174 MHz. The efficiency result is the highest result for VHF broadband frequency to date with a low supply voltage of 7.2 V. Simulations of the efficiency, output power, drain voltage waveform, and load angle (impedance) were verified by measurements and good agreements were obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Broadband Parallel-Circuit Class E RF Power Amplifier With Reactance-Compensation Technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.916906","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4463922/04447389.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.916906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447389/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Broadband Parallel-Circuit Class E RF Power Amplifier With Reactance-Compensation Technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4447389/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918497","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Broadband Parallel-Circuit Class E RF Power Amplifier With Reactance-Compensation Technique","sourcePdf":"56tmtt03-kumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112797S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4463922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4463922","articleId":"4447389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4447390,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Pavageau","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche (UMR), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) 8520, Institut d''Electronique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique et de Nanotechnologie, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France","Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4463922/4447390/4447390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christophe Pavageau was born in Angers, France, in 1979.

Two such strategies have been discussed and some modifications in their control tasks have been proposed to achieve more reliable and improved performance. In general, the multiband concept has been used while making the proposals. The hysteresis band size considerations have also been presented by taking into account the desired and existing system conditions. The proposed modulation schemes have been applied to a five-level flying-capacitor inverter, whose operation under hysteresis current control mode is much less established. A new method of flying-capacitor voltage balancing is proposed which ensures balanced flying-capacitor voltages and, at the same time, maintains the desired current profile. It uses a time-based approach for controlling the capacitor voltages and achieves appreciable voltage spectrum under wide range of load power factor conditions. The performance of the proposed strategies is confirmed through both simulation and experimental investigations.","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4463842/04447394.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.915788","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.915788","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447394","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Hysteresis","Current control","Pulse width modulation inverters","Voltage control","Open loop systems","Pulse width modulation","Switching frequency","Proposals","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","electric current control","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel hysteresis current regulation","capacitor voltage balancing","flying capacitor multilevel inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flying-capacitor multilevel inverters (FCMLI)","flying-capacitor voltage","hysteresis","multilevel inverter","time-based control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447394/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improved Multilevel Hysteresis Current Regulation and Capacitor Voltage Balancing Schemes for Flying Capacitor Multilevel Inverter","accessionNumber":"9918583","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4447394/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Multilevel Hysteresis Current Regulation and Capacitor Voltage Balancing Schemes for Flying Capacitor Multilevel Inverter","sourcePdf":"23tpel02-shukla.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080429S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4463842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"4463842","articleId":"4447394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4447467,"authors":[{"name":"Isabella Cerutti","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Isabella","lastName":"Cerutti","id":"37268425200"},{"name":"Andrea Fumagalli","affiliation":["OpNeAR Laboratory, Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Fumagalli","id":"37269378500"},{"name":"Puja Gupta","affiliation":["OpNeAR Laboratory, Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Puja","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37691872800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6692"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2566"}],"articleNumber":"4447467","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Association for Computing Machinery","url":"http://www.acm.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In conventional (noncooperative) automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols for radio networks, the corrupted data frames that cannot be correctly decoded at the destination are retransmitted by the source. In cooperative ARQ protocols, data frame retransmissions may be performed by a neighboring node (the relay) that has successfully overheard the source's frame transmission. One advantage of the latter group of ARQ protocols is the spatial diversity provided by the relay. The first delay model for cooperative ARQ protocols is derived in this paper. The model is analytically derived for a simple set of retransmission rules that make use of both uncoded and coded cooperative communications in slotted radio networks. The model estimates the delay experienced by Poisson arriving frames, whose retransmissions (when required) are performed also by a single relay. Saturation throughput, data frame latency, and buffer occupancy at both the source and relay are quantified and compared against two noncooperative ARQ protocols.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4484072/04447467.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"382","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.900360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.900360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4484072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Models of Single-Source Single-Relay Cooperative ARQ Protocols in Slotted Radio Networks With Poisson Frame Arrivals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Protocols","Radio network","Frame relay","Decoding","Delay estimation","Throughput","Cellular networks","Wireless LAN","Sensor phenomena and characterization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","radio access networks","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay models","single-source single-relay cooperative ARQ protocols","slotted radio networks","Poisson frame arrivals","conventional automatic repeat request protocols","noncooperative automatic repeat request protocols","data frame retransmissions","frame transmission","first delay model","retransmission rules","uncoded cooperative communications","Poisson arriving frames","single relay","data frame latency","buffer occupancy","noncooperative ARQ protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative ARQ","radio network","queueing model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Delay Models of Single-Source Single-Relay Cooperative ARQ Protocols in Slotted Radio Networks With Poisson Frame Arrivals","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921291","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Models of Single-Source Single-Relay Cooperative ARQ Protocols in Slotted Radio Networks With Poisson Frame Arrivals","sourcePdf":"16tnet02-cerutti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049178S","chronDate":"April  2008","isNumber":"4484072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"47","articleId":"4447467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4447473,"authors":[{"name":"Benoit Catteau","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Systems Laboratory (ELIS), Ghent University (Ghent), Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4599140/4447473/4447473-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Benoit Catteau was born in Roeselare, Belgium, in 1981.

For this purpose the DAC output signal is low-pass filtered and digitized by an accurate but low-speed calibration ADC. By replicating this analog signal path in the digital domain, the errors can be calculated and used to update the correction weights. The dynamic behavior and the accuracy of the adaptive calibration loop are analyzed both theoretically and through computer simulations, and it is shown that this way a greatly improved accuracy can be obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4599140/04447473.pdf","startPage":"1873","endPage":"1883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An On-Line Calibration Technique for Mismatch Errors in High-Speed DACs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Switches","Least squares approximation","Error correction","Circuits","Adaptive estimation","Low pass filters","Computer errors","Computer simulation","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","digital-analogue conversion","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online calibration technique","mismatch error","high-speed DAC","redundant signed digit scheme","least mean squares methods","digital-analog conversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current steering","digital\u2013analog conversion","digital calibration","LMS","redundant signed digit (RSD) coding"]},{"kwd":["digital analog conversion","current steering","digital calibration","RSD-coding","LMS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"An On-Line Calibration Technique for Mismatch Errors in High-Speed DACs","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4447473/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145758","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An On-Line Calibration Technique for Mismatch Errors in High-Speed DACs","sourcePdf":"55tcsi07-catteau.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08141S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4599140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4599140","articleId":"4447473","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4447474,"authors":[{"name":"S.

First, starting from the conventional correlation estimator, a simple and accurate ARMA correlation (ARMAC) model in terms of the poles of the ARMA system is presented in a unified manner for white noise and impulse-train excitations. The AR parameters of the ARMA system are then obtained from the noisy observations by developing and using a residue-based least-squares correlation-fitting optimization technique that employs the proposed ARMAC model. As for the estimation of the MA parameters, it is preceded by the application of a new technique intended to reduce the noise present in the residual signal that is obtained by filtering the noisy ARMA signal via the estimated AR parameters. A scheme is then devised whereby the task of MA parameter estimation is transformed into a problem of correlation-fitting of the inverse autocorrelation function corresponding to the noise-compensated residual signal. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive simulations are performed by considering synthetic ARMA systems of different orders in the presence of additive white noise and the results are compared with those of some of the existing methods. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of estimating the ARMA parameters accurately and consistently with guaranteed stability for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels as low as <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$-{5}~{\\hbox {dB}}$</tex> </formula>.

Phase rotation is proposed as an effective technique to realize fine phase resolution and thereby low sub-integer division ratios, as well as to eliminate the glitch which has plagued phase-switched dividers. Program-swallowed counters are used as the modulus controller to realize a broad-range multimodulus divider. Expressions are derived for the range and resolution of such a program-swallowed, phase-rotating divider. Furthermore, the fractional spurs from this divider topology are derived and related to the linearity of the phase rotator. It is shown that very low (-60 to -75 dBc) fractional spurs at the output of the divider can be attained with reasonably accurate phase rotators.

Computerised tomography (CT) is one of the imaging equipments for diagnosis which has most benefited from technological improvements. Because of that, and due to the quality of the diagnosis produced, it is one of the most employed equipments in clinical applications. As an example, the ischaemic cerebral vascular accident (ICVA) is a pathology confirming the frequent use of CT. The interest in this pathology, and in general for the encephalon image analysis as a preventive diagnosis, is mainly due to its frequent occurrence in development countries and its social- economic impact. In this paper we propose to evaluate the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for automatic identification of ICVAs by means of tissue density images obtained by CT. Cranioencephalon CT exams and their respective medical reports were used to train ANN classifiers by means of features extracted from the images. Once the ANNs were trained, the classifiers were tested with data never seen by the network. At this stage we may conclude that the ANNs may significantly contribute as an ICVAs CT diagnostic aid, since among the test cases the automatic identification of ischaemic lesions has been performed with no false negatives and very few false positives.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2007.4447507","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2007.4447507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447490","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4447489/4447490/04447507.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks assisted diagnosis of ischemic CVA's through CT scan","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447507/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural networks assisted diagnosis of ischemic CVA's through CT scan","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447507/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9871145","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks assisted diagnosis of ischemic CVA's through CT scan","confLoc":"Alcala de Henares, Spain","sourcePdf":"WISP-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140573S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4447489","isNumber":"4447490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447489","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4447490","articleId":"4447507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4447525,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Toth","affiliation":["Center for Mapping, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Toth","id":"37533501400"},{"name":"Dorota A.

To improve the calculated position in real implementations, WCL uses weights to attract the estimated position to close reference points provided that coarse distances are available.

Important savings in computational effort are also obtained.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2007.4447542","pdfPath":"/iel5/4447489/4447490/04447542.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2007.4447542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line sliding-window Levenberg-Marquardt methods for neural network models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"On-line sliding-window Levenberg-Marquardt methods for neural network models","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9871169","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4447542/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line sliding-window Levenberg-Marquardt methods for neural network models","confLoc":"Alcala de Henares, Spain","sourcePdf":"WISP-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080448S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4447489","isNumber":"4447490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447489","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4447490","articleId":"4447542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4447546,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Gao","affiliation":["Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Gao","id":"38105453900"},{"name":"Wenbo Xu","affiliation":["School ofInfoimation Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278553000"},{"name":"Tao Gao","affiliation":["No 2 Middle School of Bengbu, Bengbu, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Gao","id":"38133338800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0829-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0830-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4447546","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Equations","Organisms","Neural networks","Convergence","Size control","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","quantum computing","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative approach","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","global search","local search","global optimal solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative","quantum-behaved","pso","mean best"]}],"abstract":"An advanced Quantum-Particle algorithm is presented to improve the problem of the curse of dimensionality.

Several physiological and behavioral human characteristics have been suggested in the last decades as discriminating features to be used in personal recognition. Among them, fingerprint is the most widely used technique due to its high discriminating power. However, matching fingerprints in an automatic way is still a technical challenge. A compromise in the system performance exists: accuracy, security, real-time and cost are some of the critical points to face up to. The main contribution of this work is focused on the physical implementation of the recognition system. The design of an embedded system developed by means of hardware/software co-design techniques highlights much more advantages than those traditional software-based solutions. The introduction of programmable logic into the system permits the synthesis of application-specific hardware accelerators to speed up those computationally-expensive signal processing tasks, while keeping the rest of less expensive tasks under the control of a general-purpose microprocessor. The selected system architecture and the proper hardware-software partitioning of the application have made possible the development of an automatic fingerprint matcher system featuring real-time performance at an affordable cost, what is not guaranteed when developing the same matching algorithm under a purely-software platform.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2007.4447552","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4447489/4447490/04447552.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2007.4447552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded VLSI Accelerators for Fingerprint Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447552/","displayDocTitle":"Embedded VLSI Accelerators for Fingerprint Signal Processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9825114","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447552/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded VLSI Accelerators for Fingerprint Signal Processing","confLoc":"Alcala de Henares, Spain","sourcePdf":"WISP-00-62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056918S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4447489","isNumber":"4447490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447489","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4447490","articleId":"4447552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447553,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Fons","affiliation":["Departament d'Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, El\u00e8ctrica i Autom\u00e0tica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Fons","id":"37560806900"},{"name":"Mariano Fons","affiliation":["Departament d'Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, El\u00e8ctrica i Autom\u00e0tica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mariano","lastName":"Fons","id":"37294118900"},{"name":"Enrique Canto","affiliation":["Departament d'Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, El\u00e8ctrica i Autom\u00e0tica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Canto","id":"37294119700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0829-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0830-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4447553","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Image matching","Hardware","Acceleration","Field programmable gate arrays","Programmable logic arrays","Image processing","Logic devices","Reconfigurable logic","Coprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","fingerprint identification","hardware-software codesign","image enhancement","reconfigurable architectures","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint image enhancement","reconfigurable hardware accelerator","hardware-software architecture","automatic fingerprint recognition system","field programmable gate array device","sequential biometric algorithm","hardware-software co-design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware-software co-design","image processing","reconfigurable computing","system-on-chip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447553","abstract":"In this paper, an efficient hardware-software architecture is proposed to cope with the implementation of an automatic fingerprint recognition system.

Generally, complex wavelet transforms, like for example the double tree complex wavelet transform, (DTCWT), have these good properties. In this paper we propose the use of a new implementation of such a WT, recently introduced, namely the hyperanalytic wavelet transform, (HWT), in denoising applications. The proposed denoising method is very simple, implying three steps: the computation of the forward WT, the filtering in the wavelets domain and the computation of the inverse WT, (IWT). The goal of this paper is the association of a new implementation of the HWT, recently proposed, with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) filter. Some simulation examples and comparisons prove the performances of the proposed denoising method.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2007.4447560","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4447489/4447490/04447560.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2007.4447560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447490","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian Approach of Hyperanalytic Wavelet Transform Based Denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian Approach of Hyperanalytic Wavelet Transform Based Denoising","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447560/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9871181","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4447560/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian Approach of Hyperanalytic Wavelet Transform Based Denoising","confLoc":"Alcala de Henares, Spain","sourcePdf":"WISP-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089796S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4447489","isNumber":"4447490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447489","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4447490","articleId":"4447560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4447567,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Lopez","affiliation":["Departamento de Autom\u00e1tica, Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica e Inform\u00e1tica Industrial, ASLab-Autonomous System Laboratory, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Lopez","id":"37288484300"},{"name":"Ricardo Sanz","affiliation":["Departamento de Autom\u00e1tica, Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica e Inform\u00e1tica Industrial, ASLab-Autonomous System Laboratory, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Sanz","id":"37410854500"},{"name":"Felix Moreno","affiliation":["Departamento de Autom\u00e1tica, Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica e Inform\u00e1tica Industrial, bCEI-Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Moreno","id":"37297702300"},{"name":"Ruben Salvador","affiliation":["Departamento de Autom\u00e1tica, Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica e Inform\u00e1tica Industrial, bCEI-Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Salvador","id":"37297703300"},{"name":"Jaime Alarcon","affiliation":["Departamento de Autom\u00e1tica, Ingenier\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica e Inform\u00e1tica Industrial, bCEI-Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Alarcon","id":"37297701600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0829-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0830-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4447567","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Costs","Field programmable gate arrays","Cyclones","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent structures","Buildings","Embedded system","Machine vision","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","cognitive systems","computer vision","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","neural nets","reconfigurable architectures","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level cognitive architecture","FPGA-based design experience","intelligent architectures","embedded systems","artificial vision system","traffic signal detection","neural networks","BB1-AIS blackboard architecture","scaling techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","neural networks","artificial vision","reconfigurable hardware","ADAS"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes an experiment to implement a high-level, cognitive architecture on limited resources, namely, an altera cyclone/cyclone-II FPGA.

By taking advantage of the genetic algorithms to explore a large search space we present a new approach to the music transcription problem.

A strategy for designing mixture of experts in composite hypothesis test is proposed. It is based on designing a single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained with rho\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n varying uniformly in [0,1] to approximate the average likelihood ratio (ALR), and evaluate it for fixed values of rho\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n, so as to identify different variation subintervals of rho\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n, attending to the single MLP performance. Taking into consideration the relation that exists between MLP structure and the boundaries it is capable to built, we propose to train different MLPs with different sizes for each subinterval (MLP1 and MLP2, for the lower and higher half, respectively) for improving detection capabilities controlling computational cost. To improve the approximation implemented by MLP1, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) trained for the lower subinterval of ps has been combined with MLP2. As the functions approximated by the RBFNN and the MLP are equivalent but different, a combination strategy has been proposed based on thresholding the networks outputs and applying them to an OR logic function. Although this scheme does not outperform the 2MLPs, the reduction in computation cost is very important.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2007.4447634","pdfPath":"/iel5/4447489/4447490/04447634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2007.4447634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based Approaches for Detecting Signals With Unknown Parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Approaches for Detecting Signals With Unknown Parameters","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9871219","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4447634/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Approaches for Detecting Signals With Unknown Parameters","confLoc":"Alcala de Henares, Spain","sourcePdf":"WISP-00-144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057082S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4447489","isNumber":"4447490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447489","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4447490","articleId":"4447634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4447656,"authors":[{"name":"Kimmo Rautiainen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Space Technology, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4456805/4447656/4447656-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kimmo Rautiainen received the M.Sc. degree from the Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), Espoo, Finland, in 1996.","He is currently a Research Scientist with the TKK Laboratory of Space Technology.

This synthesis is performed with the help of a high spatial but low spectral resolution image: the panchromatic (Pan) image. The fusion of the Pan and MS images is classically referred as pan-sharpening. A fused product reaches good quality only if the characteristics and differences between input images are taken into account. Dissimilarities existing between these two data sets originate from two causes-different times and different spectral bands of acquisition. Remote sensing physics should be carefully considered while designing the fusion process. Because of the complexity of physics and the large number of unknowns, authors are led to make assumptions to drive their development. Weaknesses and strengths of each reported method are raised and confronted to these physical constraints. The conclusion of this critical survey of literature is that the choice in the assumptions for the development of a method is crucial, with the risk to drastically weaken fusion performance. It is also shown that the Amelioration de la Resolution Spatiale par Injection de Structures concept prevents from introducing spectral distortion into fused products and offers a reliable framework for further developments.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.912448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.912448","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4490048/04447659.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Multispectral Images to High Spatial Resolution: A Critical Review of Fusion Methods Based on Remote Sensing Physics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Multispectral Images to High Spatial Resolution: A Critical Review of Fusion Methods Based on Remote Sensing Physics","volume":"46","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921415","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4447659/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Multispectral Images to High Spatial Resolution: A Critical Review of Fusion Methods Based on Remote Sensing Physics","sourcePdf":"46tgrs05-thomas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091577S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4490048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"373","xplore-issue":"4490048","articleId":"4447659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4447660,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4497907/4447660/4447660-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Xie received the BSc and MSc degrees from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 1991 and 2000, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer science from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in 2006.

On one hand, prompt responses to access requests are essential for these applications. On the other hand, however, with an explosive increase of data volume and the emerging of faster disks with higher power requirements, energy consumption of disk-based storage systems has become a salient issue. To achieve energy-conservation and prompt responses simultaneously, in this paper we propose a novel energy-aware strategy, called striping-based energy-aware (SEA), which can be integrated into data placement in RAID-structured storage systems to noticeably save energy while providing quick responses. Next, to illustrate the effectiveness of SEA, we implement two SEA-powered striping-based data placement algorithms, SEA0 and SEA5, by incorporating the SEA strategy into RAID-0 and RAID-5, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with traditional non-stripping data placement algorithms, our algorithms significantly improve performance and save energy. Further, compared with an existing stripping-based data placement scheme, the two SEA-powered strategies noticeably reduce energy consumption with only a little performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.27","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4497907/04447660.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEA: A Striping-Based Energy-Aware Strategy for Data Placement in RAID-Structured Storage Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447660/","displayDocTitle":"SEA: A Striping-Based Energy-Aware Strategy for Data Placement in RAID-Structured Storage Systems","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9995939","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447660/","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEA: A Striping-Based Energy-Aware Strategy for Data Placement in RAID-Structured Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"ttc2008060748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11161S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4497907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4497907","articleId":"4447660","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4447668,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Archambault","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/4530415/4447668/4447668-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Archambault received the BSc degree (Hons.) from Queen's University, Kingston, in 2001 and the MSc degree from the University of British Columbia in 2003.

This hierarchy is often created using clustering algorithms or topological features present in the graph. However, many graphs have domain-specific attributes associated with the nodes and edges, which could be used to create many possible hierarchies providing unique views of the input graph. GrouseFlocks is a system for the exploration of this graph hierarchy space. By allowing users to see several different possible hierarchies on the same graph, the system helps users investigate graph hierarchy space instead of a single fixed hierarchy. GrouseFlocks provides a simple set of operations so that users can create and modify their graph hierarchies based on selections. These selections can be made manually or based on patterns in the attribute data provided with the graph. It provides feedback to the user within seconds, allowing interactive exploration of this space.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2008.34","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4530415/04447668.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4530415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2008.34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","startPage":"900","endPage":"913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GrouseFlocks: Steerable Exploration of Graph Hierarchy Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"GrouseFlocks: Steerable Exploration of Graph Hierarchy Space","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447668/","volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4447668/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10230156","pubMedId":"18467763","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GrouseFlocks: Steerable Exploration of Graph Hierarchy Space","sourcePdf":"ttg2008040900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062394S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4530415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4530415","articleId":"4447668","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4447670,"authors":[{"name":"Lingling Fan","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences Graduate, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4492939/4447670/4447670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingling Fan received the BE and ME degrees from the Department of Traffic and Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

Orientation of singular points is defined on the basis of the Zero-pole Model, which can further explain the practicability of Zero-pole Model. Contrary to orientation field generation, detection of singular points is simplified to determine the parameters of the Zero-pole Model. HT uses rather global information of fingerprint images to detect singular points. This makes our algorithm more robust to noise than methods that only use local information. As the Zero-pole Model may have a little warp from actual fingerprint orientation field, Poincare index is used to make position adjustment in neighborhood of the detected candidate singular points. Experimental results show that our algorithm performs well and fast enough for real-time application in database NIST-4.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4447670/","accessionNumber":"9966351","pubMedId":"18421101","displayDocTitle":"Singular Points Detection Based on Zero-Pole Model in Fingerprint Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Singular Points Detection Based on Zero-Pole Model in Fingerprint Images","sourcePdf":"ttp2008060929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067554S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4492939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4492939","articleId":"4447670","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4447680,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Fan","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal Center, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4599140/4447680/4447680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaohua Fan (S'02\u2013M'07) was born in China, in 1976.

Furthermore, the current injection testing technique enables accurate gain measurements in order to detect faulty impedance matching networks. The proposed current-based BIT requires an on-chip voltage source, two on-chip power detectors (PDs), and an accurate external resistor. On-chip or external equipment resources are only required to measure the dc output of the PDs. As a proof of concept, a 2.1-GHz inductor-degenerated common-source LNA with a gain of 23.9 dB was designed in 0.13-mum CMOS technology together with the BIT circuitry (14% area overhead). The gain predicted by the current injection RF BIT agrees with the simulated gain using corner models within 0.8-dB error.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918207","startPage":"1794","endPage":"1804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4599140/04447680.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Current Injection Built-In Test Technique for RF Low-Noise Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Current Injection Built-In Test Technique for RF Low-Noise Amplifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","volume":"55","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447680/","accessionNumber":"10145759","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447680/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Current Injection Built-In Test Technique for RF Low-Noise Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"55tcsi07-fan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072718S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4599140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4599140","articleId":"4447680","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4447681,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4599140/4447681/4447681-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingyu Hu received the B.E. degree in communications engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2000, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX in 2007, respectively.","He was with SigmaTel Inc., Austin, TX, in 2005 and 2006 as an Analog/Mixed-Signal Design Engineer developing integrated FM radio receiver front-ends, including low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), audio codecs and video digital\u2013analog converter (DAC) for next-generation portable audio systems.

The two-stage LNA achieves a programmable small-signal voltage gain from 0.5 to 32.5 dB in around 1-dB steps across the FM band from 76 to 108 MHz. Its input-referred noise voltage is less than 1.5 nV/radicHz in the high gain mode. Furthermore, the linearity of the LNA and front-end is improved by employing the multi-tanh design principle. In the low and high gain modes of the LNA, the measured IIP3 are -5.2 and -16.5 dBm, respectively, compared with -10.5 and -25.5 dBm without using the multi-tanh doublets.

This low complexity receiver benefits from a smartly chosen correlation template and simplified, but powerful channel compensation.

Since the ultimate precision of such a phase measurement is limited by quantum noise of the involved photons or photocharges, the eventual distance resolution of the three optical ranging methods depends in the same way on quantum noise. Evidence from literature supports our basic assertion that photon and photocharge numbers have a Poisson distribution under most experimental conditions. This allows us to derive our main result that the quantum-noise limited distance resolution of the three optical ranging methods is proportional to the inverse of the signal's modulation amplitude times the square root of the background level. The equation for the precision of the three optical distance measurement techniques contains the method's experimental parameters in a single factor, from which the optimum distance range of the three techniques can easily be deduced: 1 nm-1 mum for interferometry, 1 mum-10 m for triangulation, > 0.1 m for time-of-flight ranging, if visible or near infrared light is used.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4627555/04447692.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918231","startPage":"2368","endPage":"2377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum-Noise Limited Distance Resolution of Optical Range Imaging Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447692/","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-Noise Limited Distance Resolution of Optical Range Imaging Techniques","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447692/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10235343","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-Noise Limited Distance Resolution of Optical Range Imaging Techniques","sourcePdf":"55tcsi08-seitz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050777S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4627555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4627555","articleId":"4447692","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447724,"authors":[{"name":"Changjiu Xian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Changjiu Xian","id":"37295956700"},{"name":"Yung-Hsiang Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Yung-Hsiang Lu","id":"37280555000"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Zhiyuan Li","id":"37279078300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1889-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1890-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"4447724","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":912},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy conservation","Portable computers","Batteries","Network servers","Computer networks","Computer science","Guidelines","Hardware","Distributed computing","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer power supplies","portable computers","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive computation","energy conservation","battery-powered systems","portable computer","online statistics","computation off loading"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive computation offloading for energy conservation on battery-powered systems","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2007.4447724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447779","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4447704/4447779/04447724.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2007.4447724","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447724","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of extending the battery lifetime for a portable computer by off loading its computation to a server. Depending on the inputs, computation time for different instances of a program can vary significantly and they are often difficult to predict. Different from previous studies on computation off loading, our approach does not require estimating the computation time before the execution. We execute the program initially on the portable client with a timeout. If the computation is not completed after the timeout, it is off loaded to the server. We first set the timeout to be the minimum computation time that can benefit from off loading. This method is proved to be 2- competitive. We further consider collecting online statistics of the computation time and find the statistically optimal timeout. Finally, we provide guidelines to construct programs with computation off loading. Experiments show that our methods can save up to 17% more energy than existing approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","accessionNumber":"9979108","htmlLink":"/document/4447724/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive computation offloading for energy conservation on battery-powered systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive computation offloading for energy conservation on battery-powered systems","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-02022008-00019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099567S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4447704","isNumber":"4447779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4447704","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4447779","articleId":"4447724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4447729,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Yamawaki","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Yamawaki","id":"37429505100"},{"name":"Masahiko Iwane","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Iwane","id":"37418433900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1889-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1890-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"4447729","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Multiprocessing systems","Synchronization","Hardware","Costs","Central Processing Unit","Circuits","Clocks","Computational modeling","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","field programmable gate arrays","synchronisation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","snoop cache","synchronization","multiprocessor system-on-chip","SoC","low-overhead communication","tagged shared variable memory cache","coherence maintenance","clock speed"]}],"abstract":"FPGA based multiprocessor SoC (MPSoC) is an on-chip multiprocessor with fully programmable feature which can reduce development cost and achieve performance requirement.

The proposed design flow starts with a biquad template configuration, which is defined based on circuit regularity. Then, the symbolic transfer function in the z-domain is derived for the biquad template. Given the desired transfer function to be realized, a set of equality constraints can be obtained from coefficient matching of the symbolic transfer function and the desired one. In addition, we also formulate an exact closed-form expression for the output swing constraint so that output swings for the biquad are equalized. Other constraints, such as direct charge coupling, are also formulated. Finally, a nonlinear programming technique is used to solve for capacitance variables subject to optimal capacitance assignment, which is defined as minimizing total capacitance, total number of capacitors and circuit sensitivity. The main advantage of the proposed design flow is that an optimal biquad configuration can be obtained in an automated and accurate way. Experiments confirmed the flexibility of the design flow on obtaining optimal biquad configurations under various design tradeoffs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4599140/04447848.pdf","startPage":"2076","endPage":"2086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Design Flow for Optimal Capacitance Assignment in Switched-Capacitor Biquads","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","Digital filters","Transfer functions","Switching circuits","Capacitors","Frequency","Integrated circuit synthesis","Signal processing","Minimization","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network synthesis","switched capacitor networks","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic design flow","optimal capacitance assignment","switched-capacitor biquad circuits","biquad template configuration","symbolic transfer function","z-domain","equality constraint","closed-form expression","output swing constraint","direct charge coupling","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biquad filters","capacitance assignment","circuit sensitivity","design automation","switched-capacitor (SC) circuits","system-level synthesis"]},{"kwd":["Switched-capacitor circuits","biquad filters","capacitance assignment","system-level synthesis","circuit sensitivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Design Flow for Optimal Capacitance Assignment in Switched-Capacitor Biquads","volume":"55","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4447848/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145771","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Design Flow for Optimal Capacitance Assignment in Switched-Capacitor Biquads","sourcePdf":"55tcsi07-tang3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131602S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4599140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4599140","articleId":"4447848","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447849,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Tertinek","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria","Circuits and Systems Group, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Stefan Tertinek received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria, in 2007.

Based on a discrete-time equivalent model for nonuniform sampling, we propose the differentiator-multiplier cascade, a multistage reconstruction system that recovers the uniform samples from the nonuniform samples. Rather than using optimally designed reconstruction filters, the system improves the reconstruction performance by cascading stages of linear-phase finite impulse response (FIR) filters and time-varying multipliers. Because the FIR filters are designed as differentiators, the system works for the general nonuniform sampling case and is not limited to periodic nonuniform sampling. To evaluate the reconstruction performance for a sinusoidal input signal, we derive the signal-to-noise-ratio at the output of each stage for the two-periodic and the general nonuniform sampling case. The main advantage of the system is that once the differentiators have been designed, they are implemented with fixed multipliers, and only some general multipliers have to be adapted when the sampling pattern changes; this reduces implementation costs substantially, especially in an application like time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters (TI-ADCs) where the timing mismatches among the ADCs may change during operation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of Nonuniformly Sampled Bandlimited Signals Using a Differentiator\u2013Multiplier Cascade","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4627555/04447849.pdf","startPage":"2273","endPage":"2286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of Nonuniformly Sampled Bandlimited Signals Using a Differentiator\u2013Multiplier Cascade","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4447849/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235336","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of Nonuniformly Sampled Bandlimited Signals Using a Differentiator\u2013Multiplier Cascade","sourcePdf":"55tcsi08-tertinek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08596S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4627555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4627555","articleId":"4447849","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447912,"authors":[{"name":"Nektarios Kranitis","affiliation":["University of Athens (NKUA), Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/54/4447895/4447912/4447912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nektarios Kranitis is an adjunct lecturer in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at the University of Athens.

Different trade-offs have to be considered in choosing the right architecture for the processing blocks and the resulting hardware penalty is evaluated. We study the impact of symbol quantization that degrades performance and affects the wordlength of the rate-flexible trellis datapath. A radix-2-based architecture for this datapath relaxes the hardware requirements on the branch metric and survivor path blocks substantially. The cost of flexibility in terms of cell area and power consumption is explored by an investigation of synthesized designs that provide different transmission rates. Two designs are fabricated in a digital 0.13-mum CMOS process. Based on post-layout simulations, a symbol baud rate of 168 Mbaud/s is achieved in TCM mode, equivalent to a maximum throughput of 840 Mbit/s using a 64-QAM constellation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Hardware","Design optimization","Convolutional codes","Quantization","Degradation","Costs","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Viterbi decoder","symbol quantization","rate-flexible trellis datapath","power consumption","transmission rates","symbol baud rate","64-QAM constellation","digital CMOS process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional codes","flexibility","quantization","subset decoding","Trellis-coded modulation (TCM)","Viterbi decoding","VLSI","wireless personal area network (WPAN)"]},{"kwd":["Flexibility","convolutional codes","TCM","Viterbi decoding","quantization","subset decoding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4627555/04447931.pdf","startPage":"2411","endPage":"2422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization and Implementation of a Viterbi Decoder Under Flexibility Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization and Implementation of a Viterbi Decoder Under Flexibility Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447931/","volume":"55","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4447931/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10235345","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and Implementation of a Viterbi Decoder Under Flexibility Constraints","sourcePdf":"55tcsi08-kamuf.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06808S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4627555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4627555","articleId":"4447931","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4447932,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Ling","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4627555/4447932/4447932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Ling received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, in 2006 and 2007, respectively.","His research interests include digital signal processing in wireless communications, capacity-reaching communication system design, security in wireless networking."]},"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Ling","id":"37416197500"},{"name":"Tongtong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4627555/4447932/4447932-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tongtong Li received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Auburn University, Auburn, AL, in 2000.","From 2000 to 2002, she was with Bell Labs, and had been working on the design and implementation of 3G and 4G systems.

First, a structured transmit delay (STD) scheme is proposed for MIMO systems. Unlike existing transmit diversity approaches, in which different antennas transmit delayed, zero padded, or time-reversed versions of the same signal, in the proposed scheme, each antenna transmits an independent data stream, therefore promises higher data rate and more flexibility to transmitter design. Second, second-order statistics based blind-channel estimation algorithms are developed for MIMO systems with STD scheme. Channel identifiability is addressed for both correlation-based and subspace-based approaches. The proposed approaches involve no pre-equalization, have no limitations on channel zero locations, and do not rely on nonconstant modulus precoding. Third, when channel coding is employed, estimation accuracy can be further enhanced through ldquopostprocessingrdquo, in which channel estimation is refined by taking the tentative decisions from the channel decoder as pseudo-training symbols. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4627555/04447932.pdf","startPage":"2344","endPage":"2355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.918129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.918129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4447932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind-Channel Estimation for MIMO Systems With Structured Transmit Delay Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","MIMO","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Signal design","Statistics","Channel coding","Channel estimation","Decoding","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","correlation methods","decoding","delays","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind-channel estimation","MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","structured transmit delay scheme","transmitter design","second-order statistics","correlation-based approach","subspace-based approach","channel coding","channel decoder","pseudo-training symbols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind-channel estimation","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","structured transmit delay (STD)"]},{"kwd":["MIMO","blind channel estimation","structured transmit delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind-Channel Estimation for MIMO Systems With Structured Transmit Delay Scheme","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4447932/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208487","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind-Channel Estimation for MIMO Systems With Structured Transmit Delay Scheme","sourcePdf":"55tcsi08-ling.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104087S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4627555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4627555","articleId":"4447932","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4447933,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenying Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4447933/4447933-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhenying Luo (S'06\u2013M'07) received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China, in 2001, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tufts University, Medford, MA, in 2007.","From 2003 to 2005, he worked as an IC Design Engineer in Singapore.

The first, designated as virtual-ground common-mode (CM) feedback with output CM error correction, allows the design of fully differential RO circuits that could only be traditionally implemented before in pseudo-differential mode, and it leads to considerable savings of half of the opamps' power. The second, uses a crossed-coupled passive sampling interface to avoid the extra track-and-reset stages as required in both RO and SO circuits, further saving one front-end opamp's power. The third, employs a voltage-controlled level-shifting (LS) technique that utilizes the charge redistribution property to process the CM LS in an LV environment, avoiding the degradation of the feedback factor by the use of extra LS circuits. Finally, the fourth, the LV finite-gain compensation technique allows the use of low-gain high-speed single-stage amplifier in contrast to the conventional high-gain, low-speed two-stage opamp to achieve a high-speed operation in both RO and SO circuits. Without any clock boosting or bootstrap circuits, all of the above techniques can be applied in LV applications without any floating switches limitations. Measurement results of a 1.2-V 10-bit 60 MS/s pipelined analog-digital converter in 0.18- mum CMOS with RO are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, achieving a signal-to-noise distortion ratio of 55.2 dB with 85-mW power consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4447935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4447935/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235346","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Circuit Techniques for Low-Voltage High-Speed Reset- and Switched-Opamps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Circuit Techniques for Low-Voltage High-Speed Reset- and Switched-Opamps","sourcePdf":"55tcsi08-sin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07333S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4627555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4627555","articleId":"4447935","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4448348,"authors":[{"name":"Haluk Kulah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/4443122/4448348/4448348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haluk K\u00fclah (S'97\u2013M'03) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering (high honors) from the Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2003.","From 2003 to 2004, he was employed as a Research Fellow at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan.

For most wireless applications, the ambient vibration is generally at very low frequencies (1-100 Hz), and traditional scavenging techniques cannot generate enough energy for proper operation. The reported generator up-converts low-frequency environmental vibrations to a higher frequency through a mechanical frequency up-converter using a magnet, and hence provides more efficient energy conversion at low frequencies. Power is generated by means of EM induction using a magnet and coils on top of resonating cantilever beams. The proposed approach has been demonstrated using a macroscale version, which provides 170 nW maximum power and 6 mV maximum voltage. For the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) version, the expected maximum power and maximum voltage from a single cantilever is 3.97 muW and 76 mV, respectively, in vacuum. Power level can be increased further by using series-connected cantilevers without increasing the overall generator area, which is 4 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

The proposed read-out scheme exhibits a relative insensitivity to the ongoing aggressive scaling of the supply voltage. It is based on a novel compact spiking pixel circuit, which combines digitizing and memory functions. Illumination is encoded into a Gray code using a very simple yet robust Gray 8-bit counter memory. Circuit simulations and experiments demonstrate the successful operation of a 64 64 image sensor, implemented in a 0.35 CMOS technology. A scalability analysis is presented. It suggests that deep sub-0.18 will enable the full potential of the proposed Gray encoding spiking pixel. Potential applications include multiresolution imaging and motion detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Intermediate Read-Out for Deep Submicron Technology CMOS Image Sensors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2007.912783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4443122/04448349.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2007.912783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443122","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust Intermediate Read-Out for Deep Submicron Technology CMOS Image Sensors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4448349/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920270","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Intermediate Read-Out for Deep Submicron Technology CMOS Image Sensors","sourcePdf":"08jsen03-shoushun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117104S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4443122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4443122","articleId":"4448349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4448353,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Meng","id":"37629883300"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278651400"},{"name":"Soura Dasgupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Soura","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37279679000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4448353","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1003},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Minimax techniques","Position measurement","Convergence","Least squares approximation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Intelligent sensors","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimax techniques","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semidefinite programming approach","source localization models","wireless sensor networks","minimax approximation","convex optimization problems","SDP algorithm","nonconvex maximum likelihood algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","semidefinite programming","source localization","wireless sensor network"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel approach to the source localization and tracking problem in wireless sensor networks.

Simulation results show that the LDPC-APPM with an outer LDPC code of medium code length suffers a loss of about 0.7 dB at a bit-error rate of relative to the serially concatenated PPM (SCPPM) of similar parameters, which consists of the serial concatenation of an outer convolutional code, an interleaver, a bit-accumulator, and PPM; however, it has better code rate flexibility especially for high rates and simpler implementation structure than SCPPM. Further, it can achieve better performance than the LDPC-PPM of the same rate and length, which consists of the serial concatenation of an LDPC code and PPM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448365/","volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4448365/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9792376","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Coded Modulation Scheme for Deep-Space Optical Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coded Modulation Scheme for Deep-Space Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"20lpt05-tan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037098S","chronDate":"March1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4447282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4447282","articleId":"4448365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4448432,"authors":[{"name":"Suzana Uran","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"bio":{"p":["Suzana Uran (S'96\u2013M'04) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, in 1985, 1989, and 1998, respectively.","She is currently an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Robotics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, where she has been since 1985.

The data collected from infrasound microphones are presented online by the infrasound monitoring system operating in Northern Europe, i.e., the Swedish-Finnish Infrasound Network (SFIN). Processing the continuous flow of data to extract optimal feature information is important for real-time signal classification. Performing wavelet decomposition on the real-time signals is an alternative. The purpose of this paper is to present the design and FPGA implementation of discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) for real-time infrasound data processing; our approach uses only two FIR filters, a high-pass and a low-pass filter. A compact implementation was realized with pipelining techniques and multiple use of generalized building blocks. The design was described in VHDL and the FPGA implementation and simulation were performed on the QUARTUS II platform.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2007.914322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear

Timestamps must then be interpolated between samples to achieve adequate time resolution for coincidence detection of annihilation radiation. A low-pass filter based interpolation algorithm adding up to 31 samples between original samples was designed to improve timing resolution of the LabPET scanner. A 2-bit refinement in the determination of the pulse maximum amplitude leads to a better estimation of the triggering threshold, which in turn enables a more accurate timestamp generation. Timestamp accuracy was investigated as a function of trigger level (15%-50% of maximum value). With the trigger threshold set at 20%, coincidence time resolution of ns for LYSO-LYSO and ns for LGSO-LGSO are obtained. A real time implementation of the algorithm was achieved in a Xilinx FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2007.911883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4448435/04448479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2007.911883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448435","startPage":"34","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing Improvement by Low-Pass Filtering and Linear Interpolation for the LabPET Scanner","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timing Improvement by Low-Pass Filtering and Linear Interpolation for the LabPET Scanner","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9901543","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4448479/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Improvement by Low-Pass Filtering and Linear Interpolation for the LabPET Scanner","sourcePdf":"55tns01-fontaine-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075064S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4448435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4448435","articleId":"4448479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4448495,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin S.

Interrupt latency, rescheduling and inter-process communication times are compared in the framework of a sample real-time application. Performance measurements on Gigabit Ethernet network communication have also been carried out on the target boards. To this purpose, we have considered the Linux IP stack and RTnet, an open-source hard real-time network protocol stack for Xenomai and RTAI, which was ported to the considered architecture. Performance measurements show that the tested open-source software is suitable for hard real-time applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4448435/04448543.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2007.905231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2007.905231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of VxWorks, Linux, RTAI, and Xenomai in a Hard Real-Time Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linux","Measurement","Open source software","Operating systems","Rivers","Delay","Ethernet networks","Protocols","Computer architecture","Software testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux","local area networks","physics computing","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wind River VxWorks","Linux","RTAI","Xenomai","VMEbus MVME5500 boards","MPC7455 PowerPC processor","Gigabit Ethernet network communication","open-source hard real-time network protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time systems","Linux","RTAI","Xenomai","ADEOS","RTnet","VxWorks","PowerPC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of VxWorks, Linux, RTAI, and Xenomai in a Hard Real-Time Application","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4448543/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9884065","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of VxWorks, Linux, RTAI, and Xenomai in a Hard Real-Time Application","sourcePdf":"55tns01-taliercio-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062885S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4448435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4448435","articleId":"4448543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4448563,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineeri, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hui Li","id":"37087178197"},{"name":"Desheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineeri, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Desheng Wang","id":"37087279720"},{"name":"Zhaowu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineeri, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhaowu Chen","id":"37087778298"},{"name":"Ning Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineeri, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ning Liu","id":"37087330013"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1094-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4448563","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Nonlinear systems","Broadband amplifiers","System performance","Filter bank","Polynomials","Digital video broadcasting","Baseband","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearisation techniques","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filterbank-based parallel Hammerstein predistorter","high power amplifier linearization","indirect learning architecture","memory effects","asymmetric spectral regrowth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filterbank","high power amplifiers (HPAs)","memory effects","nonlinear systems","predistorter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448563","doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448563.pdf","startPage":"627","endPage":"631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A filterbank-based parallel hammerstein predistorter for high power amplifier linearization","abstract":"High power amplifiers (HPAs) used in wideband systems exhibit evident memory effects besides nonlinearities, which significantly degrade the system performance.

In this paper, we propose a filterbank-based parallel Hammerstein predistorter, which is constructed using the indirect learning architecture. With the filterbank employed, the HPA with memory effects is linearized in the lower and upper frequency subbands individually. Simulation results show that the proposed predistorter is effective in linearizing HPAs with memory effects. When the HPA exhibits asymmetric spectral regrowth, compared with a memory polynomial predistorter, the proposed predistorter performs better in terms of spectral regrowth suppression and inband distortion reduction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4448563/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9829279","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A filterbank-based parallel hammerstein predistorter for high power amplifier linearization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A filterbank-based parallel hammerstein predistorter for high power amplifier linearization","confLoc":"Penang","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057566S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4448569,"authors":[{"name":"Yusnita Yusof","affiliation":["Kulliyyah of Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Yusnita Yusof","id":"38097120100"},{"name":"Othman O.

It has been proven that this problem is NP-complete and therefore no exact algorithm can be found.

To this end, we model the effect of leaky bucket mechanism on a typical data user, with a closed product form queueing network. Each node in this queueing network corresponds to a specific processing gain or equivalently transmission rate and power. By solving such a queueing network we obtain the steady state probability with which a typical data user will exist at each node. By aggregating the effects of all data users we compute the mean and variance of interference and obtain the throughput and average delay for a typical data user. In the last part of the paper, we observe the efficiency of leaky bucket in different conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448595.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of data traffic shaping on throughput and delay for VSG-CDMA cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Throughput","Delay effects","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Traffic control","Interference","Multiaccess communication","Gain","Fluctuations","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","probability","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VSG-CDMA","data traffic shaping","delay","data users","variable spreading gain","wireless cellular network","queueing network","steady state probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Leaky bucket","throughput","CDMA","traffic shaping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effect of data traffic shaping on throughput and delay for VSG-CDMA cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4448595/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9829311","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of data traffic shaping on throughput and delay for VSG-CDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068993S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4448597,"authors":[{"name":"Seyedmohammadreza Faghih-Imani","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"lastName":"Seyedmohammadreza Faghih-Imani","id":"38353068600"},{"name":"Farid Ashtiani","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"lastName":"Farid Ashtiani","id":"37542222100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1094-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4448597","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":62},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new approach in computing interference distribution and outage probability for uplink CDMA cellular networks. In this approach, we model time-varying interference as a discrete-time Markov chain with flexible approximation and find its steady state distribution. Our approach is based on tracing the time variation of the effective factors in interference such as spatial locations, activity status, and shadowing status for the connected users. To this end, we approximate shadowing with several discrete levels by Lloyd algorithm. Moreover, we incorporate correlation properties of the shadowing status in our model. Then, we map the effective factors onto the parameters of a closed Jackson queueing network. With respect to the product-form solution property of Jackson queueing network, we compute the probability distribution of the traffic states corresponding to the various interference statuses. Hence, this approach enables us to find outage probability and following that, static capacity in heterogeneous conditions. At last, we validate the capability of our model for some situations by simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448597.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference modeling and generalized static capacity for uplink CDMA cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Shadow mapping","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Steady-state","Probability distribution","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","discrete time systems","Markov processes","probability","queueing theory","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference modeling","CDMA cellular network","time-varying interference","discrete-time Markov chain","Lloyd algorithm","Jackson queueing network","probability distribution","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","interference","queueing network","shadowing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Interference modeling and generalized static capacity for uplink CDMA cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4448597/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9829313","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference modeling and generalized static capacity for uplink CDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039432S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4448598,"authors":[{"name":"Mahrokh G.

Adaptive beamforming exploits the spatial knowledge from antenna arrays in suppressing co-channel interference. On the other hand, adaptive modulation maximizes the throughput while maintaining a given target bit error rate (BER) by selecting the modulation mode according to the instantaneous channel quality. In order to maximize the benefits from both techniques, their combination is considered. The simulation of fixed modulation adaptive beamforming (FM-ABF) shows that the degradation in BER is reasonably small even for a large reduction in weight recalculation rate. This motivates the investigation of joint adaptive modulation adaptive beamforming (AM-ABF) system, where adaptive modulator assists adaptive beamformer in determining the need to recalculate the weight. The novelty of this paper lies in the ability of the joint technique to adapt the weight recalculation rate according to the near instantaneous signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which represents the channel fading rate. Simulation results are shown to compare the performance of the proposed joint AM-ABF with the FM-ABF for the case of one and two interferers.

In this paper, we propose a novel interference cancellation scheme by using the joint multiple access system from the merge of CDMA and SDMA systems to form dynamic space code multiple access (DSCMA). This multiple access system uses a modified version of large area synchronous (LAS) sequence called LAS even-ternary (LAS-ET) sequence to increase its duty ratio. This sequence also exhibits a region called interference free window (IFW) near zero delay time offset. In order to ensure that all the signal components drop within the IFW, a narrow beam with higher directivity smart antenna system is exploited. The size of IFW is adapted to the smart antenna half-power beamwidth using DSC algorithm. By using this algorithm the spectrum efficiency is further increased. Finally, all the interferences induced in non-uniform traffics can be dramatically reduced in DSCMA system and thus resulting in a higher system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448641","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448641.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interference cancellation scheme using dynamic space code multiple access (DSCMA) system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448641/","displayDocTitle":"An interference cancellation scheme using dynamic space code multiple access (DSCMA) system","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4448641/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9829356","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interference cancellation scheme using dynamic space code multiple access (DSCMA) system","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082349S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4448662,"authors":[{"name":"Sharifah Kamilah Syed-Yusof","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Sharifah Kamilah Syed-Yusof","id":"38271333300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1094-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4448662","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Polynomials","Partial response signaling","Bandwidth","Wireless communication","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM modulation","Gain","Frequency domain analysis","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intercarrier interference","next generation broadband wireless communication system","OFDM signal","peak-to-average power ratio","partial response signaling","integer coefficient system","carrier-to-interference power ratio","fraction time-selective envelope modification technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ICI","OFDM","PAPR","PRS"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the most promising technique for next generation broadband wireless communication system. The major setbacks of OFDM signal are intercarrier interference (ICI) and high peak- to-average power ratio (PAPR). The purpose of this thesis is to develop mechanisms to reduce ICI and PAPR in OFDM systems. Partial response signaling OFDM (PRS-OFDM) with integer coefficient system has been developed to minimise the ICI. The carrier-to-interference power ratio (CIR) is enhanced by 2.6 dB to 5 dB compared to the normal OFDM. The PAPR has been reduced using Fraction Time-Selective (FTS) Envelope Modification technique. The FTS Envelope Modification PRS-OFDM managed to reduce the PAPR by 0.8 dB to 2.8 dB. Efficient bandwidth usage is achieved by manipulating the PRS-OFDM signal characteristics, where minimal side information (SI) is required due to restricted envelope modification factors.","doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448662","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","startPage":"382","endPage":"386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing PAPR in PRS-OFDM system using Fraction Time-Selective (FTS) Envelope Modification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing PAPR in PRS-OFDM system using Fraction Time-Selective (FTS) Envelope Modification","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448662/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9829377","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4448662/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing PAPR in PRS-OFDM system using Fraction Time-Selective (FTS) Envelope Modification","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03438S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4448663,"authors":[{"name":"Faruk Keskin","affiliation":["Research Group for Radio Communications, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Faruk","lastName":"Keskin","id":"37299601700"},{"name":"Paul Walter Baier","affiliation":["Research Group for Radio Communications, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul Walter","lastName":"Baier","id":"37299596900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1093-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1094-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4448663","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","MIMO","OFDM","Downlink","Land mobile radio","Receivers","Channel state information","Transmitters","Signal generators","Radio communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO OFDM multi-user downlinks","THP","soft precoding","downlink transmission concepts","transmit nonlinear zero forcing","amplitude dynamic","imperfect channel state information","nonlinear precoding schemes","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding"]}],"abstract":"In 1993 Nakagawa and Esmailzadeh first proposed the generation of radio signals by precoding. As the asset of such schemes, they excel by a low receiver complexity, which makes them attractive for applications like mobile radio downlinks with their demand of inexpensive terminals. Unfortunately, linear precoding does not offer any transmit power reductions as compared to transmission schemes not resorting to precoding. However, such reductions become feasible - under virtually maintaining the low receiver complexity of linear precoding -, if we use non-linear instead of linear precoding. In the paper two downlink transmission concepts following this rationale will be comparatively assessed, namely a scheme termed Transmit Nonlinear Zero Forcing, and a concept termed soft precoding. Primarily, the assessment focuses on the required transmit powers. However, the aspects of the amplitude dynamic of the received signals and the impact of imperfect channel state information are addressed as well. The target systems of the investigations are MIMO OFDM multi-user downlinks. It turns out that the proposed non-linear precoding schemes not only excel by reduced transmit powers, but also offer increased robustness with regard to imperfect channel state information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient MIMO OFDM multi-user downlinks: THP based versus soft precoding","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448663","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448663.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient MIMO OFDM multi-user downlinks: THP based versus soft precoding","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4448663/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9829378","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient MIMO OFDM multi-user downlinks: THP based versus soft precoding","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064481S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4448664,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim S.

The analysis focuses on scattering coefficient and atmospheric attenuation effects on low visibility, which falls in the range of 1.8 km to 4.5 km. The performance comparison is also done for the wavelength of 850 nm and 1550 nm. The result shows that the performance of 1550 nm is better than 850 nm in both performance parameters. As the link range between transmitter and receiver increases, the atmospheric attenuation increases too. Deployment distance of less than 1km can reduce the effect of atmospheric attenuation. These challenges limit FSO to the short distance application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4448669/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9829384","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the effect of haze on free space optical communication in the Malaysian environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the effect of haze on free space optical communication in the Malaysian environment","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035837S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4448670,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The detector supports two MIMO-OFDM schemes, SFBC-OFDM and SDM-OFDM, in order to achieve higher performance and throughput. However, symbol detection processes for these two schemes have high computational complexity, which is a burden to hardware implementation of MIMO-OFDM symbol detectors. In order to reduce the complexity, we propose a cost-efficient algorithm for SDM-OFDM and novel hardware architecture for MIMO-OFDM symbol detectors. The proposed detector with shared-architecture, where similar functional blocks are merged and share the hardware resources, can be used for not only SDM-OFDM but also SFBC-OFDM systems. The proposed symbol detector reduces the logic gates by 54% and the occupation ratio by 12.8% compared to a conventional symbol detector employing two individual detectors. Therefore, the proposed symbol detector will be a vast contribution to the low complexity design of MIMO-OFDM systems, since the MIMO-OFDM symbol detector is one of the largest modules in the systems, in which the low complexity design is a very important issue.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Wireless LAN","Hardware","MIMO","OFDM","Throughput","Fading","Algorithm design and analysis","Detection algorithms","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol detector","MIMO-OFDM","wireless LAN","two-transmit antennas","two-receive antennas","SFBC-OFDM","SDM-OFDM","symbol detection processes","computational complexity","cost-efficient algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output","symbol detection","space-frequency block coded OFDM","space division multiplexing OFDM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448690","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448690.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient design of symbol detector for MIMO-OFDM based wireless LANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient design of symbol detector for MIMO-OFDM based wireless LANs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448690/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4448690/","accessionNumber":"9829405","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient design of symbol detector for MIMO-OFDM based wireless LANs","confLoc":"Penang","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042639S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4448691,"authors":[{"name":"Sridhar Nandula","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sridhar","lastName":"Nandula","id":"37869881800"},{"name":"K.

Time orthogonal as well as simultaneously transmitted training sequences are considered. The channel is assumed to be slowly varying time-dispersive, i.e., constant during one OFDM symbol but changing from symbol to symbol. Channel estimation is performed in time-domain followed by zero-forcing equalization in the frequency-domain. The computational complexity is significantly reduced by applying the matrix inversion lemma. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator with time orthogonal training sequences has better estimation performance over a range of Doppler spreads compared to the case when the training sequences are simultaneously transmitted from the different transmit antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448692","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications and Malaysia International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4444356/4448552/04448692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448552","startPage":"520","endPage":"525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain RLS-based channel estimation for MIMO OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain RLS-based channel estimation for MIMO OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448692/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9829407","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4448692/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain RLS-based channel estimation for MIMO OFDM systems","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312008-00140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076379S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4444356","isNumber":"4448552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4444356","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4448552","articleId":"4448692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4448694,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Higher voltage DC has been proposed as an energy efficient distribution option for both types of facilities, and this paper presents an analytical evaluation of several data center power delivery architectures over a range of loads, showing that a 400 V facility-level DC distribution option is the most efficient.

In high-quality DC power systems, the existing DC protection devices, such as the fuse and the Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB), cannot conduct quick and stable circuit breaking. Therefore, we developed a semiconductor switch that uses a metal oxide semiconductor-field effect transistor (MOS-FET) as a new DC protection device. However, although it is possible to quickly break a HVDC circuit using this semiconductor switch, the possibility of a malfunction still exists because the semiconductor switch is an active device. Therefore, we included a retry function that repeats the turn on and turn off of the MOS-FET at certain periods, thus devising a method of evading malfunctions.

This development has influenced the actual existing standards for power supply interfaces. European Telecommunication Standardization Institute (ETSI) is the regional organization that is recognized by the EC and EFTA as one of the three official standards-making bodies in Europe, and is responsible for standardization in the whole field of telecommunications, including radio, broadcasting and private telecommunications. The requirements for the power distribution to the interface \"A\" for -48V/-60V are standardized in ETSI EN 300 132-2. The mixing of traditional telecommunication equipment with new broadband and IT equipment in the Central Office (CO) and access network need a solution for powering and safe installation (earthing, grounding, batteries) with higher efficiency and reliability. In the year 2003 ETSI published ETSI EN 300 132-3 for direct powering the transmission equipment with 400 V. In several workshops at INTELEC 2003, 2004, 2005 and worldwide initiatives, the different experiences and solutions in connection to several pilot projects were discussed. A wide use of DC in electrical installations offers high energy efficiency, and improves power quality in the AC distribution network. This presentation will give a small overview of the standardization in the last 5 years with the actual results, problems and trends in the worldwide realization of higher efficient powering of the new internet equipment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 4 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448761/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4448761/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9810340","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-4 Oct. 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ETSI standards and guides for efficient powering of telecommunication and datacom","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ETSI standards and guides for efficient powering of telecommunication and datacom","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282008-00050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041737S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 4 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4448710","isNumber":"4448711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4448710","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4448711","articleId":"4448761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4448800,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Leccese","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Leccese","id":"37670115700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1627-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1628-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-0473"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5210"}],"articleNumber":"4448800","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448800","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Condition monitoring","Humans","Contracts","Power engineering and energy","Low voltage","Substations","Instruments","Manufacturing","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply quality","telecommunication power supplies","transformer substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rome","perceived power quality","electrical energy","medium/low voltage transformer rooms","telecommunication power substations","Italian telecommunication society","self-made instrument"]}],"abstract":"A monitoring of power quality parameters it is been effected inside four medium/low voltage transformer rooms of telecommunication power substations of the biggest Italian telecommunication society.

The advantage of the DiSOM is that it allows the sampling frequency of the digital compensator to be higher than the switching frequency, but it also has the ability to shape the quantization noise on the switching output due to clock frequency quantization. An envelope tracking power supply for an RF power amplifier (RFPA) can help improve system efficiency by reducing the power consumption of the RFPA. To show the advantage of the DiSOM over traditional counter based digital PWM modulators two designs were compared in both simulation and by experiment. The results shows that the DiSOM could give an increase in open loop bandwidth by more than a factor of two and reduce the closed loop output impedance of the power supply by a factor of 5 at the output filter resonance frequency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4448711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.2007.4448857","publicationTitle":"INTELEC 07 - 29th International Telecommunications Energy Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"INTELEC 07 - 29th International Telecommunications Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4448710/4448711/04448857.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"642","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.2007.4448857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digitally controlled envelope tracking power supply for an RF power amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 4 2007","displayDocTitle":"Digitally controlled envelope tracking power supply for an RF power amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-4 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4448857/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9810394","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448857/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digitally controlled envelope tracking power supply for an RF power amplifier","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282008-00146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056443S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 4 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4448710","isNumber":"4448711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4448710","xplore-issue":"4448711","articleId":"4448857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4448871,"authors":[{"name":"Jim McDowall","affiliation":["Saft America, Inc., North Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"McDowall","id":"37282839600"},{"name":"Philippe Biensan","affiliation":["Saft, Bordeaux, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Biensan","id":"38132049600"},{"name":"Michel Broussely","affiliation":["Saft America, Inc., North Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Broussely","id":"37328355300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1627-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1628-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-0473"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5210"}],"articleNumber":"4448871","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":690},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lithium","Batteries","Product safety","Portable computers","Communication industry","Telecommunication standards","Availability","Temperature","Manufacturing","Containers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["safety","secondary cells","telecommunication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial lithium ion battery safety","telecom network operators","international standards","abuse tolerance","high energy density","potential tradeoffs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448871","abstract":"The issue of lithium ion battery safety has become very prominent of late, but with much larger lithium-based batteries being seriously considered or actively deployed by many telecom network operators, safety has been elevated to a new level.

Recently, the conventional lifting scheme that concerns the construction of 2-channel filter banks has been extended to M-channel filter banks (M > 2), bringing up the desirable properties of the lifting scheme to a broader range of applications. Many hand-crafted lifting-based VLSI architectures exist, which mostly concentrate on a single and specific target application having fixed data throughput and resource consumption. However, the reusability of such architectures is limited due to the lack of scalability. To overcome this issue, we present a design methodology for automatic synthesis of VLSI architectures suitable for arbitrary lifting-based M -channel filter banks and transforms. The proposed methodology enables high parameterizability in terms of data throughput, resource consumption, and arithmetic precision for the generated architectures. The concept of parameterizing design elements is important for modern system-on-chip design, since it features design space exploration and increases reusability. The proposed methodology is implemented as a high-level compilation tool that generates VLSI architectures at the register transfer level. We present results on the implementation of different architectures that were generated by our tool.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145748","htmlLink":"/document/4448961/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Approach for Synthesizing VLSI Architectures of Lifting-Based Filter Banks and Transforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Approach for Synthesizing VLSI Architectures of Lifting-Based Filter Banks and Transforms","sourcePdf":"55tcsi07-bartholoma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086033S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4599140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4599140","articleId":"4448961","onlineDate":"08 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4448962,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Bin Hsieh","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4599140/4448962/4448962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi-Bin Hsieh (S'07) was born in 1973, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Applications of these flows are increasingly abundant in the future as the Internet evolves. Since these flows require use of CPUs in network elements, both bandwidth and CPU resources can be a bottleneck and thus congestion control must deal with ldquocongestionrdquo on both of these resources. In this paper, we show that conventional TCP/AQM schemes can significantly lose throughput and suffer harmful unfairness in this environment, particularly when CPU cycles become more scarce (which is likely the trend given the recent explosive growth rate of bandwidth). As a solution to this problem, we establish a notion of dual-resource proportional fairness and propose an AQM scheme, called Dual-Resource Queue (DRQ), that can closely approximate proportional fairness for TCP Reno sources with in-network processing requirements. DRQ is scalable because it does not maintain per-flow states while minimizing communication among different resource queues, and is also incrementally deployable because of no required change in TCP stacks. The simulation study shows that DRQ approximates proportional fairness without much implementation cost and even an incremental deployment of DRQ at the edge of the Internet improves the fairness and throughput of these TCP flows. Our work is at its early stage and might lead to an interesting development in congestion control research.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.900415","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4484072/04448985.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.900415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4484072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Resource TCP/AQM for Processing-Constrained Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4448985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4448985/","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Resource TCP/AQM for Processing-Constrained Networks","volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921302","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4448985/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Resource TCP/AQM for Processing-Constrained Networks","sourcePdf":"16tnet02-shin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110506S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4484072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4484072","articleId":"4448985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4448986,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Shu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Management Information Systems, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4542818/4448986/4448986-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen-Shu Wang is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Management Information Systems, National Cheng-Chi University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.","Her research interests include artificial intelligence, recommendation system and knowledge discovery, reverse logistics management, and soft mining applications."]},"firstName":"Chen-Shu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538398900"},{"name":"Ching-Ter Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Chung Hua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4542818/4448986/4448986-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ching-Ter Chang received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Information Management, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1992 and 1997, respectively.","He is currently a Full Professor and Dean of the Library, National Chunghua University of Education, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Two of the challenges encountered during the exploitation of more efficient architectures for the SA-DCT and SA-IDCT are addressed. One challenge is to handle the architectural irregularity due to the shape-adaptive nature. The other one is to provide acceptable throughput using minimal hardware. In the algorithm-level optimization, this work exploits the numerical properties found in the transform matrices of various lengths, and derives a fine-grained zero-skipping scheme for the IDCT which can perform 22.6% more zero-skipping than the common vector-based coarse-grained zero-skipping scheme does. In the architecture-level design, the 1-D variable-length DCT/IDCT architectures designed on the basis of the numerical properties are proposed. An auto-aligned transpose memory that aligns the data of different lengths is also incorporated. In addition, a zero-index table is also included in the transpose memory to support the fine-grained zero-skipping in the SA-IDCT. The synthesized designs of the SA-DCT and SA-IDCT are implemented using UMC 0.18-mum technology. The SA-DCT architecture has 26 635 gates, and its average cycle-throughput is 0.66 pixels/cycle, which is comparable to other proposed architectures. On the other hand, the SA-IDCT architecture has 29 960 gates, and its cycle-throughput is 6.42 pixels/cycle. While decoding for CIF@30FPS, the SA-IDCT is clocked at 0.7 MHz, and the power consumption is 0.14 mW. Both the throughput and power consumption of the proposed SA-IDCT architecture are an order better than those of the existing SA-IDCT architectures.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.918275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4479597/04449077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.918275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479597","startPage":"375","endPage":"386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture Design of Shape-Adaptive Discrete Cosine Transform and Its Inverse for MPEG-4 Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Architecture Design of Shape-Adaptive Discrete Cosine Transform and Its Inverse for MPEG-4 Video Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920801","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4449077/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture Design of Shape-Adaptive Discrete Cosine Transform and Its Inverse for MPEG-4 Video Coding","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt03-hsu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089393S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4479597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4479597","articleId":"4449077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4449078,"authors":[{"name":"Vasant Patil","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Vasant","lastName":"Patil","id":"37296962000"},{"name":"Rajeev Kumar","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38197965500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4449078","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Discrete cosine transforms","Transcoding","Costs","Matrix decomposition","Spatial resolution","Table lookup","Nonlinear filters","Decoding","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","matrix decomposition","motion compensation","transcoding","vectors","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse motion compensation algorithm","DCT-domain video transcoder","discrete cosine transform","motion vectors","matrix multiplication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain processing","motion compensation","MPEG-2","video transcoding"]},{"kwd":["Video transcoding","DCT domain processing","motion compensation","MPEG-2."]}],"abstract":"The existing methods to perform motion compensation (MC) in discrete cosine transform (DCT) treat each 8 times 8 block as a fundamental unit and, therefore, involve the high cost of reconstructing prediction frames, especially when the half-pixel motion vectors (MVs) are involved.

Coherent communications typically involve a form of M-ary phase shift keyed (MPSK) signaling, combined with one of a variety of channel equalization schemes at the receiver. The most common scheme is the mean square error minimization (MMSE) decision feedback equalizer (DFE), designed in part by Professors John Proakis and Milica Stojanovic and now extended by many developers for a variety of applications. Even though often effective, the performance of the DFE becomes far from the optimal performance that can be obtained by the maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE). While aiming for the optimal performance, our interest is in the use of small, battery- powered, DSP-based devices which have fairly hard constraints on computer resources. We consider an older alternative to the DFE, the maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE), usually implemented with a Viterbi algorithm. Referring to historical coding theory, it is well known that a sequential estimation alternative to MLSE-based decoding is \"almost\" as effective, given a modest increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the computational burden is usually far less than with the conventional Viterbi approach. The focus of this paper is on the development and application of a Fano Sequential Estimator acting as an alternative to the Viterbi algorithm for MLSE-based channel compensation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4449138/","accessionNumber":"9854017","displayDocTitle":"MMSE-Lattice Sequential Equalization of Underwater Acoustic Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE-Lattice Sequential Equalization of Underwater Acoustic Channels","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"OCEANS07-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041814S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446228","isNumber":"4449115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446228","xplore-issue":"4449115","articleId":"4449138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTSIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449173,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Cochenour","affiliation":["Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Cochenour","id":"37400032600"},{"name":"Linda Mullen","affiliation":["Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Mullen","id":"37294084600"},{"name":"Alan Laux","affiliation":["Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Laux","id":"37400032400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0933957-35-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"4449173","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":758},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital communication","Wireless communication","Optical fiber communication","Optical scattering","Optical modulation","Underwater communication","Optical devices","Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature phase shift keying","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication","optical communication","optical links","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","underwater optics","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase coherent digital communications","wireless optical links","turbid underwater environment","optical signal spatial distribution","underwater optical communication","underwater scattering environment","temporally encoded information","underwater optical links","BPSK modulation","QPSK modulation","8- PSK modulation","16-QAM modulation","32-QAM modulation","link quality effects","water turbidity effects"]}],"abstract":"Previous studies by the authors have included a theoretical and experimental investigation of the spatial distribution of an optical signal used for communications in underwater scattering environments.

To this end, channel estimation for sparse underwater acoustic channels is examined. Based on the on-off keying techniques developed in [1], a new iterative scheme for sparse channel estimation is provided. The method is of lower complexity than that of [1], exploiting features of underwater acoustic channels. The strategy iterates between zero-tap detection and structured channel estimation. The new sparse channel estimation scheme is compared to the Matching Pursuit method. It is shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the latter over realistic underwater acoustic channels and has comparable computational complexity. Furthermore, the new estimation method does not require channel order information, in contrast to Matching Pursuit.","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446228/4449115/04449228.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Sparse Channel Estimator for Underwater Acoustic Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Sparse Channel Estimator for Underwater Acoustic Channels","htmlLink":"/document/4449228/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9854107","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Sparse Channel Estimator for Underwater Acoustic Channels","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"OCEANS07-00-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04301S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446228","isNumber":"4449115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446228","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4449115","articleId":"4449228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTSIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4449247,"authors":[{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Eng, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yahong Rosa","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38184497400"},{"name":"Chengshan Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Eng, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Chengshan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37280816900"},{"name":"T.

The proposed SC-FDE employs a small training signal block for initial channel estimation in the frequency domain and converts the estimated transfer function to a desired DFT (discrete Fourier transform) size for channel equalization of the data blocks. The frequency domain equalizer is designed using the linear minimum mean square error criterion. A new phase coherent detection scheme is also proposed and deployed to combat the phase drift due to the instantaneous Doppler in the underwater channels. The channel transfer functions and group-averaged phase drift are re-estimated adaptively in a decision-directed manner for each data block in a packet, which contains M blocks of QPSK data. The proposed SC-FDE method is applied to single input multiple output (SIMO) systems using the experimental data measured off the coast of Panama City, Florida, USA, June 2007. The uncoded bit error rate of the SIMO systems varies between 1.3% to 6.8 x 10 5 when 4 ~ 8 receive hydrophones are utilized, and the source-receiver range is 5.06 km.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449247","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446228/4449115/04449247.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Single Carrier Underwater Acoustic Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449247/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Single Carrier Underwater Acoustic Communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9854126","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449247/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Single Carrier Underwater Acoustic Communications","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"OCEANS07-00-132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076536S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446228","isNumber":"4449115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446228","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4449115","articleId":"4449247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTSIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4449272,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Chou Lee","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Naval Mechatronic Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Chou","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281499300"},{"name":"Lan-Ting Wang","affiliation":["Tainan University of Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lan-Ting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406752000"},{"name":"Jyun-Gu Ou","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Naval Mechatronic Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyun-Gu","lastName":"Ou","id":"38118342700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0933957-35-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"4449272","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"In this paper, the underwater acoustic imaging is given by diversity techniques.

The proposed method is based on sound field prediction, using software packages ANSYS and SYSNOISE to simulate the process of measuring the array manifold in practical systems. For a given array supporting structure, the numerical boundary element method is used to calculate the array outputs when a test signal is assumed in the far-field of the array so as to obtain the sensor responses including both amplitude and phase of each element. Varying the relative incident angle of the test signal to the array will yield a collection of array responses in different directions and therefore form the array manifold. SYSNOISE provides a powerful tool to implement the idea of predicting the sensor responses. Since SYSNOISE itself does not possess the ability to generate the boundary grids, the finite element software ANSYS is used to fulfill it.

The relative motion between transmitter and receiver creates a Doppler shift of the received signal and introduces a time-scale variation to the channel which is characterized by Doppler spread and channel coherence time. In order to simulate the physically probable time-varying channel, we suggest a channel model which is based on the ray theory. It exploits the eigen-ray information of ray tracing to determine the discrete signal transmission paths and adds them to random diffusive multipaths whose amplitude and phase are modeled by Rayleigh and uniform distribution, respectively. If the carrier frequency is quite large, it satisfies the uncorrelated scattering assumption and gives the scattering function which shows how the signal is distributed over range and frequency. We apply the suggested model to a case of an underwater platform moving in the shallow water and present its result.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449361","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446228/4449115/04449361.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-varying Underwater Acoustic Channel Modeling for Moving Platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449361/","displayDocTitle":"Time-varying Underwater Acoustic Channel Modeling for Moving Platform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9862873","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449361/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-varying Underwater Acoustic Channel Modeling for Moving Platform","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"OCEANS07-00-246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079139S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446228","isNumber":"4449115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446228","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4449115","articleId":"4449361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTSIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449383,"authors":[{"name":"Fengzhong Qu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Fengzhong","lastName":"Qu","id":"37410299300"},{"name":"Liuqing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Liuqing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279440300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0933957-35-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"4449383","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Bandwidth","Transducers","Sonar equipment","MIMO","Channel estimation","Time-varying channels","Underwater communication","Delay effects","Underwater tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal space-time block-differential modulation","underwater acoustic communications channels","acoustic carrier frequency","multi-input multi-output schemes","time delay domain","frequency domain","differential MIMO scheme","doubly-selective UAC channel","channel estimation","basis expansion model","Jakes model"]}],"abstract":"Underwater acoustic communications (UAC) channels are well known to be bandlimited due to the low acoustic carrier frequency. In terrestrial communications, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) schemes have long been proved to provide improved capacity without bandwidth expansion. However, the application of these MIMO designs, especially coherent ones, is challenging since UAC channels are spreading in both the time delay domain and the frequency domain. In such extremely bandlimited and doubly-selective channel conditions, the pilots necessary for accurate channel estimation can considerably reduce the bandwidth efficiency of the system. To avoid such problems, we propose a differential MIMO scheme for doubly-selective UAC channels. Our approach is based on orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC), but bypasses channel estimation. As a result, not only a higher bandwidth efficiency is preserved, but also the processing complexity at the receiver is reduced. We adopt the basis expansion model (BEM) to model the doubly-selective channels. Both analytical and numerical results show that our approach can collect full 3-dimensional diversity: space, Doppler and multipath. The results are verified over both the generated channels using Jakes' model and the estimated channels from a real underwater experiment.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449383","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446228/4449115/04449383.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Space-Time Block-Differential Modulation over Underwater Acoustic Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449383/","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Space-Time Block-Differential Modulation over Underwater Acoustic Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9854201","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449383/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Space-Time Block-Differential Modulation over Underwater Acoustic Channels","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"OCEANS07-00-268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049227S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446228","isNumber":"4449115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446228","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4449115","articleId":"4449383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTSIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4449384,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Data hazards and structure hazards, which are the two most critical issues for a pipelined filter, are analyzed and resolved. Efficient memory organization for both on-chip SRAM and transposition buffers is employed. By using innovative hybrid edge filtering sequence and out-of-order memory update scenario, we obtain zero stall cycle in normal pipeline flow, making the best out of a pipelined architecture. Compared with existing designs, our design achieves at least 18% clock cycle reduction, as well as 20% lower power consumption owing to its efficient pipeline and memory architecture. The total gate count is comparable to other designs in literature without using any expensive two-port or dual-port on-chip SRAMs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920810","htmlLink":"/document/4449469/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Five-Stage Pipeline, 204 Cycles/MB, Single-Port SRAM-Based Deblocking Filter for H.264/AVC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Five-Stage Pipeline, 204 Cycles/MB, Single-Port SRAM-Based Deblocking Filter for H.264/AVC","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt03-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077028S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4479597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4479597","articleId":"4449469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4449470,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4479597/4449470/4449470-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bing Zeng (M'92) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, in 1983 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, in 1991, all in electrical engineering.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the University of Toronto and Concordia University during 1991\u20131993 and was a Visiting Researcher with Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China, in 2000.

With almost no exception, this conventional DCT is implemented separately through two 1-D transforms, one along the vertical direction and another along the horizontal direction. In this paper, we develop a new block-based DCT framework in which the first transform may choose to follow a direction other than the vertical or horizontal one. The coefficients produced by all directional transforms in the first step are arranged appropriately so that the second transform can be applied to the coefficients that are best aligned with each other. Compared with the conventional DCT, the resulting directional DCT framework is able to provide a better coding performance for image blocks that contain directional edges-a popular scenario in many image signals. By choosing the best from all directional DCTs (including the conventional DCT as a special case) for each image block, we will demonstrate that the rate-distortion coding performance can be improved remarkably. Finally, a brief theoretical analysis is presented to justify why certain coding gain (over the conventional DCT) results from this directional framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional Discrete Cosine Transforms\u2014A New Framework for Image Coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.918455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4479597/04449470.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.918455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479597","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Directional Discrete Cosine Transforms\u2014A New Framework for Image Coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4449470/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920812","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional Discrete Cosine Transforms\u2014A New Framework for Image Coding","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt03-zeng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054215S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4479597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4479597","articleId":"4449470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4449486,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Rodrigues","affiliation":["INESC ID/IST-TU Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"38131159000"},{"name":"Horacio Neto","affiliation":["INESC ID/IST-TU Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Horacio","lastName":"Neto","id":"37300331900"},{"name":"Helena Sarmento","affiliation":["INESC ID/IST-TU Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Helena","lastName":"Sarmento","id":"37344442900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1277-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1278-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449486","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Field programmable gate arrays","FCC","Ultra wideband communication","Digital signal processing","Ultra wideband technology","Demodulation","Streaming media","Bandwidth","Ground penetrating radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","OFDM modulation","receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","field programmable gate arrays","ultra wideband communication","UWB receiver","wireless USB","fast Fourier transforms"]}],"abstract":"The rules defined by FFC, for marketing and operation of UWB products, permitted the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to implement UWB communications.

The evaluation of the error bound can be useful for new design paradigms where retry and self-recovering techniques are being applied to the design of high performance processors. The method here described allows to evaluate the performance of these techniques by means of calculating the expected error probability in terms of power supply distribution quality.","doi":"10.1109/DTIS.2007.4449513","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Design & Technology of Integrated Systems in Nanoscale Era","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Design & Technology of Integrated Systems in Nanoscale Era","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446723/4449471/04449513.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DTIS.2007.4449513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error probability in synchronous digital circuits due to power supply noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Error probability in synchronous digital circuits due to power supply noise","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9881611","htmlLink":"/document/4449513/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error probability in synchronous digital circuits due to power supply noise","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056846S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446723","isNumber":"4449471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446723","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4449471","articleId":"4449513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449517,"authors":[{"name":"Ameir Fanei","affiliation":["L2MP UMR CNRS 6137, University of Provence IMT, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Ameir","lastName":"Fanei","id":"38125013600"},{"name":"Philippe Pannier","affiliation":["L2MP UMR CNRS 6137, University of Provence IMT, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Pannier","id":"37270748900"},{"name":"Jean Gaubert","affiliation":["L2MP UMR CNRS 6137, University of Provence IMT, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Gaubert","id":"37270752100"},{"name":"Marc Battista","affiliation":["L2MP UMR CNRS 6137, University of Provence IMT, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Battista","id":"37599032700"},{"name":"Yannick Bachelet","affiliation":["L2MP UMR CNRS 6137, University of Provence IMT, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Bachelet","id":"37681362800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1277-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1278-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449517","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Circuit noise","Testing","Bandwidth","CMOS technology","Frequency","Wideband","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","computational electromagnetics","integrated circuit noise","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic simulation","substrate noise","ultra wideband low noise amplifier","UWB systems","lumped model","substrate coupling","frequency 6 GHz to 10 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Substrate noise","substrate coupling","substrate noise modeling","ultra wideband","EM simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449517","abstract":"Impact of substrate noise on a 6-10 GHz low noise amplifier (LNA) is investigated in this work.

We propose a novel technique to estimate the area utilization of LUT (Look-Up Table) based FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) for custom instruction realizations. The technique contributes to rapid design exploration by computing the hardware area utilization of custom instructions without actual hardware synthesis. The proposed area estimation technique is achieved in two stages. In the first stage, a set of partitions are obtained from the custom instruction data-paths based on some rule-sets that satisfy the FPGA constraints. Each partition represents a unique LUT configuration that can be implemented on a FPGA logic element. In the second stage, the partitions are combined to maximize the area efficiency on FPGA. We show that the proposed technique can overcome the limitation of existing datapath merging methods that are based on maximizing resource sharing. Experimental results show that an average of 12 unique LUT configurations (about 22% of the logic elements in the smallest Xilinx Virtex FPGA) can sufficiently cater to seven applications from the MiBench benchmark suite.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449544","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449544.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"High level area estimation of custom instructions for FPGA-based reconfigurable processors","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828031","htmlLink":"/document/4449544/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High level area estimation of custom instructions for FPGA-based reconfigurable processors","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068182S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449547,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay K.

As spectrum sensing forms an important functionality for these systems, the following areas were investigated into in this paper. Firstly, the basic spectrum sensing schemes were integrated with data and decision fusion techniques to improve performance in the presence of multiple secondary users. Further analysis of Ad Hoc sensing schemes was done with emphasis on distributed sensing schemes. The effects of varying the number of participating neighbours on fusion values were studied in detail. It was seen that varying the sensing time and the number of participating neighbours produces changes in the throughput and detection probabilities. The changes produced by varying these parameters were discussed in detail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9828034","htmlLink":"/document/4449547/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Data and decision fusion for distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data and decision fusion for distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040936S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449575,"authors":[{"name":"Xiumei Li","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xiumei Li","id":"37579037500"},{"name":"Guoan Bi","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Guoan Bi","id":"37280818700"},{"name":"Yingtuo Ju","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yingtuo Ju","id":"37279650700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449575","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Fourier transforms","Radar imaging","Signal resolution","Radar applications","Signal analysis","Sonar applications","Time frequency analysis","Signal processing","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","polynomials","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISAR imaging","local polynomial Fourier transform","short time Fourier transform","radar imaging","SNR ratio"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the local polynomial Fourier transform is introduced.

The received TRHKNN consists of \"fast\" Kohonen neural network, \"middle\" Kohonen neural network and \"slow\" Kohonen neural network. The illustrative example - recognition and restoration of distorted low-quality fingerprint - was carried out using this TRHKNN. The received TRHKNN has not only high speed of image recognition, but also high speed of image restoration. The simulations for the TRHKNN were carried out in a MATLAB/Simulink environment.

The advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods in terms of ranging performance, energy saving, and complexity saving are illustrated by analytical and simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity exploiting MIMO-OFDMA ranging","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449592","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449592.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Diversity exploiting MIMO-OFDMA ranging","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449592/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828076","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity exploiting MIMO-OFDMA ranging","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04425S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4449598,"authors":[{"name":"Yunpeng Hu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineerin, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yunpeng Hu","id":"37290867500"},{"name":"Hongyi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineerin, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hongyi Yu","id":"37275011500"},{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineerin, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Bo Liu","id":"37291888300"},{"name":"Hanying Hu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineerin, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hanying Hu","id":"37292017700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449598","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Frequency estimation","Frequency synchronization","AWGN channels","Information science","Paper technology","Signal to noise ratio","Time division multiple access","Ad hoc networks","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","frequency estimation","quadrature phase shift keying","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-data-aided carrier synchronization","QPSK burst transmission","AWGN channel","feedforward estimator","pilot symbols","frequency estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["burst transmission","frequency estimation","semidata-aided","QPSK"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with frequency estimation for QPSK burst-mode transmissions in AWGN channel.

The constraints on magnitude response and array output power are derived as linear functions of the autocorrelation sequence of array weight. The adaptive beamformer, which is formulated as quadratic optimization problem in conventional beamforming methods, is reformulated as linear programming problem. Unlike the conventional robust beamformers, the proposed method can control the beamwidth and response ripple of the robust response region flexibly. With this method, a large robust response region is possible and the resulting beamformer still have high performance on signal- to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement. Numerical results show the superior performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449617","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449617.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449617","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel robust beamformer based on linear optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A novel robust beamformer based on linear optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449617/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449617/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828099","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel robust beamformer based on linear optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056413S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4449619,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To this end, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is specified as the air interface. In OFDMA, the MAC frame extends over two dimensions: time, in units of OFDMA symbols, and frequency, in units of logical sub-channels. The base station (BS) is responsible for allocating data into the MAC frames so as to meet the quality of service (QoS) guarantees of the admitted connections of the mobile stations (MSs). This is done on a frame-by-frame basis by defining the content of map messages, which advertise the position and shape of data regions reserved for transmission to/from MSs. We refer to the latter operation as data region allocation. In this paper, we propose a sample data region allocation algorithm (SDRA), and we evaluate its performance by means of Monte Carlo analysis. The effectiveness of SDRA is assessed in several scenarios, involving mixed voice over IP (VoIP) and best effort MSs, different modulations, and frequency re-use plans.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449619.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Downlink Data Region Allocation Algorithm for IEEE 802.16e OFDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols","Time division multiple access","Quality of service","Frequency conversion","Base stations","Shape","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","broadband networks","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","IEEE standards","Internet telephony","mobile radio","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VoIP","frequency re-use","voice over IP","Monte Carlo analysis","QoS","quality of service","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","fixed broadband wireless access","mobility support","MAC protocol","medium access control protocol","OFDMA","IEEE 802.16e","downlink data region allocation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.16","OFDMA","Channel allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Downlink Data Region Allocation Algorithm for IEEE 802.16e OFDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449619/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828101","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Downlink Data Region Allocation Algorithm for IEEE 802.16e OFDMA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055902S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4449622,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Da","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Bin Da","id":"38125334900"},{"name":"C.C.

This optimization problem is under constraints on transmitted power of each user, bit error rate (BER), equal fairness and restricted subcarrier sharing GPC. We then propose two MDSS algorithms to solve this problem with relatively low computational complexity.

The proposed system exploits the potential spatial and frequency diversity of MIMO systems in frequency-selective fading environments through a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we use space-time coding to exploit the spatial diversity, and in the second stage, we adopt block spreading among blocks of OFDM carriers to obtain frequency diversity. Moreover, by using rotated Hadamard matrix or rotated discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix as the carrier spreading matrix, the system can also possess a certain degree of modulation diversity. Our proposed system enjoys the advantage of high flexibility and low complexity. It allows the use of any existing space-time coding scheme as its component space-time code, and the diversity gains are obtained with only moderate transmit and receive processing complexity. Simulation results show that our proposed system can achieve desired spatial and frequency diversity with low detection complexity. Comparing to some existing space-frequency coding schemes, our proposed system enjoys the merit of low complexity, although it could suffer from some performance degradation, which is caused by the separation of space-time coding and frequency-domain spreading process.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449667","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449667.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM systems based on space-time coding and OFDM carrier block spreading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM systems based on space-time coding and OFDM carrier block spreading","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449667/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828146","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4449667/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM systems based on space-time coding and OFDM carrier block spreading","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079739S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4449669,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Hak Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Hak","lastName":"Kim","id":"37419624200"},{"name":"Cheol-Ho Shin","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheol-Ho","lastName":"Shin","id":"38124669500"},{"name":"Sangsung Choi","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangsung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292417100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449669","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a low power consumption packet detection scheme based on cross correlation and complex multiplication for MB-OFDM UWB system.

The simulation results shows that the proposed system performs better in terms of system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449700","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449700.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlap cut frequency domain equalization for two-layer spreading CDMA uplink system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Overlap cut frequency domain equalization for two-layer spreading CDMA uplink system","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449700/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828176","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4449700/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlap cut frequency domain equalization for two-layer spreading CDMA uplink system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069086S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4449710,"authors":[{"name":"Salina Abdul Samad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Salina Abdul Samad","id":"37087774582"},{"name":"Dzati Athiar Ramli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Dzati Athiar Ramli","id":"37087775858"},{"name":"Aini Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Aini Hussain","id":"37087773711"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449710","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Authentication","Filters","Spectrogram","Displays","Speech processing","Signal processing","Image processing","Reliability theory","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","message authentication","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisample single-source model","spectrographic feature","biometric authentication","correlation filter","speaker authentication","speech signal","inclusion morphological image processing","unconstrained minimum average correlation energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrographic features","multi-sample approach","correlation filter","morphological image processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449710","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449710.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-sample single-source model using spectrographic features for biometric authentication","abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel approach by using spectrographic features and correlation filters as classifiers to perform speaker authentication.

It is discovered that, by applying these two techniques, the verification performance improves significantly. For the classification modeling, Unconstrained Minimum Average Correlation Energy (UMACE) filter is implemented. We propose a multi-sample approach by fusing multiple samples from different utterances at the score level. By using the average operator, both the theoretical and empirical results show that by integrating as many samples as possible can improve the overall reliability of the system.

These codes are essentially extended LDPC codes where the additional redundant symbols come from a larger alphabet. In particular, we address the effects that zero divisors as edge weights in the Tanner graph of LDPC codes over Z, have, from the pseudocodeword perspective. First, we show that weighting certain edges of a Tanner graph with zero divisors of Z, can reduce the number of pseudocodewords arising from its finite degree covers. Second, we prove that in adding a redundant row to a given parity-check matrix, the smaller the number of zero divisors it contains, the more effective it is in constricting the corresponding fundamental polytope. Moreover, we argue that cycles of length four are not bad provided at least one of the four corresponding edge weights is a zero divisor. The culmination of these findings is a procedure for judiciously adding redundant check nodes to the Tanner graph representation of a mixed- alphabet code such that significant performance improvements under iterative decoding may be obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449724/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449724/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828199","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of LDPC codes extended with parity-check symbols from a larger alphabet","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of LDPC codes extended with parity-check symbols from a larger alphabet","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053814S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449728,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Hao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuang-Hao Lin","id":"37291133500"},{"name":"Robert C.

The B-LDPC code, which is a special class of quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC), has an efficient encoding algorithm owing to the simple structure of their parity-check matrices. A proposed distribution of irregular parity-check matrix for the modified B-LDPC is developed so that we can obtain an area-efficient decoder design, good error correction performance, and achievable architecture implementation. The modified B-LDPC code decoding utilizes the iterative min-sum algorithm (MSA) and its decoding architecture design employs the non-overlapping operations of bit node unit (BNU) and check node unit (CNU). Different block matrix sizes for parity-check matrix can be adopted so that the modified B-LDPC code decoding improves the throughput without obvious performance degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture of the modified Block-Type Low-Density parity-check code decoding design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Hardware","Digital communication","Error correction","AWGN","Iterative algorithms","Throughput","Error analysis","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","cyclic codes","decoding","error correction codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified block-type low- density parity-check code decoding design architecture","quasi-cyclic LDPC","encoding algorithm","parity-check matrices","area-efficient decoder design","error correction performance","iterative min-sum algorithm","bit node unit","check node unit","block matrix sizes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)","decoder","encoder","hardware architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of the modified Block-Type Low-Density parity-check code decoding design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449728/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828202","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of the modified Block-Type Low-Density parity-check code decoding design","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041967S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4449733,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yang Han","id":"37293173300"},{"name":"See Ho Ting","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"See Ho Ting","id":"37270082500"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yong Liang Guan","id":"37272208800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449733","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"abstract":"In this paper, we first propose a new class of full rate full diversity quasi-orthogonal space time block code (QO-STBC), namely QO-STBC with blind preceding (BP-QO-STBC).

By exploiting the special structure of BP-QO-STBC, we derived two decoding algorithms with different complexities, namely an optimal maximum likelihood decoder which achieves the lowest decoding complexity known for all full rate full diversity QO-STBC, and a suboptimal linear decoder with even lower complexity. Thus a flexible tradeoff between complexity and performance is achieved. A comparison between the proposed scheme and Random Beamforming in terms of bit error rate is also shown via simulation and the results support our proposed scheme as a better practical candidate for high speed wireless network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449733.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high rate open-loop MIMO multi-user downlink transmission system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Receiving antennas","Maximum likelihood decoding","Space technology","Array signal processing","Bit error rate","Block codes","Broadcasting","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","decoding","MIMO communication","radio links","receiving antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high rate open-loop MIMO system","multiuser downlink transmission","quasiorthogonal space time block code","receiving antenna","decoding algorithm","full rate full diversity QO-STBC","suboptimal linear decoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A high rate open-loop MIMO multi-user downlink transmission system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828207","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high rate open-loop MIMO multi-user downlink transmission system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071258S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449737,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewon Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jaewon Chang","id":"37087314721"},{"name":"Gwyun Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gwyun Jin","id":"37088117784"},{"name":"Seongmin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seongmin Kim","id":"37087201901"},{"name":"Bin-Chul Ihm","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Technology Research Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Anyang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Bin-Chul Ihm","id":"37087555007"},{"name":"Wonjin Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wonjin Sung","id":"37087311031"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449737","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Diversity reception","Demultiplexing","Performance gain","Land mobile radio","Interference","Degradation","Standardization","Adaptive signal detection","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","cellular radio","demultiplexing","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location-adaptive signal detection","maximal ratio combining","spatial demultiplexing","adaptive signal detection strategy","dual-antenna terminals","MIMO channel model","cell boundary","intercell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximal ratio combining","spatial demultiplexing","intercell interference","dual-antenna terminals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449737","abstract":"In typical cellular mobile radio systems, the intercell interference degrades the signal detection performance of mobiles due to the low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) near coverage boundaries. Such performance impairment can be mitigated by the usage of the terminals equipped with dual antennas, as suggested in 3GPP-LTE contributions, e.g., Rl-050829. Standardization and related usages of systems utilizing dual-antenna terminals is expected to keep increasing due to the anticipated performance gain. In this paper, we propose an adaptive signal detection strategy of dual-antenna terminals which can enhance the reception quality and the system bandwidth efficiency, and investigate the performance gain of the proposed scheme. The scheme either uses maximal ratio combining (MRC) between two antennas or performs spatial demultiplexing (SD) under the 2-by-2 MIMO channel model, based on the received SIR value. We first analyze the probability density function (pdf) and the effective SIR for the MRC and SD detection respectively, using the 4-cell and 7-cell configurations. Based on the analysis, we derive the location range within a cell at which the switching location of the adaptive detection mode is applied to the dual-antenna terminals. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme significantly improves the effective SIR and spectral efficiency near the cell boundaries.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449737","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449737.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A location-adaptive signal detection scheme for dual-antenna terminals using maximal ratio combining and spatial demultiplexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A location-adaptive signal detection scheme for dual-antenna terminals using maximal ratio combining and spatial demultiplexing","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449737/","accessionNumber":"9828211","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449737/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A location-adaptive signal detection scheme for dual-antenna terminals using maximal ratio combining and spatial demultiplexing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068937S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4449749,"authors":[{"name":"Jwo-Yuh Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jwo-Yuh Wu","id":"37087145745"},{"name":"Sheng-Po Fan","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-Po Fan","id":"37087336661"},{"name":"Jie-Gang Kuang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jie-Gang Kuang","id":"37087337363"},{"name":"Ta-Sung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ta-Sung Lee","id":"37086999278"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449749","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"abstract":"We propose a minimal BER power allocation scheme for a class of quasi-orthogonal space-time block coded transmission (the so-called ABBA system) over i.i.d.

In the cyclic filter bank, all arguments are interpreted modulo some integer due to the periodicity of signals. This provides more degrees of freedom in design problems. In this paper, we present a systematic method to design two-channel linear phase orthogonal cyclic filter banks with real-valued coefficients. With the aim of employing half-sample symmetric cyclic filters, we derive a condition of the magnitude response for a cyclic filter bank to satisfy the orthogonality. The orthogonal cyclic filter bank with half-sample symmetric filters, which have a nearly ideal magnitude response at discrete values of the frequency, can be designed via the proposed scheme. As one design example, we show such a linear phase orthogonal cyclic filter bank with the period L = 32. Finally, several simulations that compare the performance of our designed cyclic filter bank, the conventional cyclic filter bank and the noncyclic Daubechies 9/7-tap filter bank in image compression are illustrated to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach for images with highly detailed content.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Nonlinear filters","Design methodology","Image coding","Signal processing algorithms","Convolution","Computer science","Frequency","Transform coding","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","linear phase filters","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-channel linear phase orthogonal cyclic filter bank","half-sample symmetric filter","image coding","image compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal transforms","cyclic filter banks","linear phase filters","transform coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449772","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449772.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Two-channel orthogonal cyclic filter banks with half-sample symmetric filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Two-channel orthogonal cyclic filter banks with half-sample symmetric filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449772/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449772/","accessionNumber":"9828242","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Two-channel orthogonal cyclic filter banks with half-sample symmetric filters","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043578S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4449779,"authors":[{"name":"Koichiro Hashiura","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ibaraki University, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichiro","lastName":"Hashiura","id":"37829266400"},{"name":"Hiromasa Habuchi","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ibaraki University, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromasa","lastName":"Habuchi","id":"37269784300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449779","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Broadcasting","Access protocols","Error correction","Educational institutions","Roads","Vehicles","Propagation losses","Correlators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","pull-type packet compensation protocol","perfect MCS-CDMA","broadcasting system","multi-code sense code division multiple access","access control","average packet acquisition time","random code selection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of pull-type packet compensation protocol with perfect MCS/CDMA for the broadcasting system","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449779","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449779","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the pull-type packet compensation protocol with perfect multi-code sense code division multiple access (MCS/CDMA).

In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol based on direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) for wireless networks to guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) which depend on acceptable bit error rate (BER) for different traffic types, named the distributed time slot reservation protocol (DTSRP). A channel is divided into control and data channels to transmit control and data packets in the corresponding control and data frames, respectively. The data frame is further subdivided into several time slots; each time slot can transmit different traffic types such as constant bit rate (CBR), variable bit rate (VBR), and available bit rate (ABR). Each station maintains the available spreading code (ASC) table to understand which time slots and spreading codes have been reserved. DTSRP will allocate time slots and the spreading code for the data frame by using the fixed time slot allocation (FTSA) or the mixed time slot allocation (MTSA). The QoS can be guaranteed by providing the reservation of time slots and the spreading code. A Markov model is applied to analyze the DTSRP DS-CDMA system; the analytical and simulation results show that the proposed DTSRP performs very well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS scheduling based on acceptable BER in DS/CDMA wireless networks","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449784","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449784.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"QoS scheduling based on acceptable BER in DS/CDMA wireless networks","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449784/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885084","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS scheduling based on acceptable BER in DS/CDMA wireless networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049613S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449787,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Kozawa","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ibaraki University, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Yusuke Kozawa","id":"37391642700"},{"name":"Hiromasa Habuchi","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ibaraki University, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromasa","lastName":"Habuchi","id":"37269784300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449787","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical sensors","Optical noise","Multiple access interference","Optical fiber communication","Bit error rate","Multiaccess communication","Optical modulation","Optical pulses","Educational institutions","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical communication","optical modulation","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric optical DS/SS","on-off orthogonal m-sequence pairs","on-off keying","antipodal DS/SS","scintillation","background-noise","avalanche photo-diode noise","thermal noise","multiple access interference","MAI"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, atmospheric optical DS/SS systems with on-off orthogonal m-sequence pairs are considered.

Consequently, the optical DS/SS using the on-off orthogonal m-sequence pairs is superior to the optical DS/SS using extended prime code sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis of atmospheric optical DS/SS with On-Off Orthogonal M-sequence Pairs","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449787","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449787.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis of atmospheric optical DS/SS with On-Off Orthogonal M-sequence Pairs","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449787/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828255","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis of atmospheric optical DS/SS with On-Off Orthogonal M-sequence Pairs","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045046S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449789,"authors":[{"name":"Harya Wicaksana","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Harya","lastName":"Wicaksana","id":"37295035300"},{"name":"Habibul Islam","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Singapore"],"firstName":"Habibul","lastName":"Islam","id":"38557141700"},{"name":"Guan Yong Liang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guan Yong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37667570000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449789","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","RAKE receivers","Sociotechnical systems","Performance analysis","Decorrelation","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Delay effects","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","delays","error statistics","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open loop transmit diversity","downlink CDMA system","multicell CDMA system","delay transmit diversity","orthogonal transmit diversity","space time spreading","RAKE receiver","decorrelating receiver","bit error rate","multiple antenna transmit diversity"]}],"abstract":"We present the performance comparison of delay transmit diversity (DTD), orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD) and space time spreading (STS) schemes in the downlink multicell CDMA systems.

In this paper, to face with the PAPR problem, we propose a new algorithm called Eigenmode Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (EM-THP), by introduction of modulo operations at both the transmitter and the receiver.

Among them the most well-known is orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, or OFDM. Whatever the form, such systems usually transmit many known pilots to assist channel estimation and data detection. We consider receiver techniques that can help improve the bandwidth efficiency by reducing the needed amount of pilots. In particular, we consider using only a block of pilots as the preamble. Then the receiver tracks the channel variation via jointly iterative channel estimation and data detection. It uses a frequency-domain equalizer to reduce the complexity. Simulations show that the tracking ability of the proposed method is good.","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449812.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jointly iterative channel estimation and data detection for cyclic-prefixed block transmission over time-varying channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Jointly iterative channel estimation and data detection for cyclic-prefixed block transmission over time-varying channels","htmlLink":"/document/4449812/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9828276","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jointly iterative channel estimation and data detection for cyclic-prefixed block transmission over time-varying channels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046431S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4449817,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Nan Liu","id":"37291227600"},{"name":"Han Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Han Wang","id":"37292552600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449817","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"Motivated by the advantages of Trace transform and discrete cosine transform (DCT), an integrated face representation is proposed.

In this paper, we analyze the use of baseband predistorters in OFDM systems. Two PA models are considered: the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) model and Wiener-Hammerstein model. Two types of predistorters are investigated: the amplitude and phase predistorter and polynomial-based predistorter with indirect learning architecture. A comparative study of performance of different combinations of PA models and predistorters is presented in terms of both total degradation (TD) and power spectral density (PSD). Simulation results show that both TD and PSD need to be jointly considered for performance evaluation in the development of the predistorter design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of amplitude and phase predistortion and polynomial-based predistortion in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449843","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449843.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of amplitude and phase predistortion and polynomial-based predistortion in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449843/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828305","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of amplitude and phase predistortion and polynomial-based predistortion in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030178S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4449844,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Ashok Bohara","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Vivek Ashok Bohara","id":"37589863200"},{"name":"See Ho Ting","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"See Ho Ting","id":"37270082500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449844","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","OFDM","Polynomials","Power system modeling","Phase noise","Nonlinear distortion","High power amplifiers","Phase detection","Interference","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Gaussian noise","intercarrier interference","nonlinear equations","OFDM modulation","polynomials","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signals","nonlinear polynomial models","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","nonlinear distortion effects","nonlinear high power amplifier","intercarrier interference components","Gaussian nonlinear noise","error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms","OFDM","HPA","nonlinear noise","nonlinear polynomial model"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a theoretical analysis of nonlinear distortion effects in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system when the signal is passed through a nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA) which is modeled as a nonlinear polynomial model. From theoretical analysis of the received OFDM signal it is shown that the data symbol detected after the decision device at the receiver comprises of complex phase shifted version of the original transmitted data symbol as well as intercarrier interference (ICI) components which can be modeled as a Gaussian nonlinear noise term uncorrelated with the data symbol. Analytical expressions for the complex phase shift and nonlinear noise term are derived. Thus from the derived expressions the output signal to noise ratio and hence probability of error can be evaluated theoretically, avoiding a need to perform extensive simulations. A comparison between the theoretical and simulated results are also presented to verify the accuracy of our analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449844","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449844.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis of OFDM signals in nonlinear polynomial models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449844/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis of OFDM signals in nonlinear polynomial models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828306","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449844/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis of OFDM signals in nonlinear polynomial models","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058856S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4449847,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yue Xiao","id":"37556980400"},{"name":"Yongrui Peng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yongrui Peng","id":"38128616000"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Shaoqian Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449847","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Filtering","Multiple access interference","Computational complexity","Frequency domain analysis","Transmitters","Digital video broadcasting","Paper technology","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","interleaved codes","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved OFDMA system","PAPR reduction","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","computational complexity","repeated clipping","filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","PAPR","RCF"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low complexity peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction technique in interleaved orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system.

The use of angles eases the optimization procedure due to the limited search space of plusmnpi.

Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the channel transfer function for the receiver to enhance the system performance.

The activity recognition and tracking are carried out using two levels of approaches. At level 1, the movement and flexion angles of body segments are recovered from accelerometer signal by using extended Kalman filter (EKF). At level 2, the movements of body segments are further aggregated by using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for activity recognition. The proposed system is applied to monitoring and identifying normal daily activities in an apartment. Experimental results indicate that, by using the proposed system, body activity can be identified with high accuracy and short system latency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wearable sensors","Monitoring","Hidden Markov models","Service oriented architecture","Data acquisition","Sensor systems","Control systems","Real time systems","Accelerometers","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","condition monitoring","hidden Markov models","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time physical activity classification","wearable sensors","sensor-network physical activity monitoring system","body activity tracking","data acquisition","service-oriented architecture","real-time service management","activity recognition","extended Kalman filter","accelerometer signal","hidden Markov model","HMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wearable sensors","service-oriented architecture (SOA)","activity classification","extend Kalman filter","hidden Markov model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449890","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449890.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time Physical Activity classification and tracking using wearble sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time Physical Activity classification and tracking using wearble sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449890/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4449890/","accessionNumber":"9828349","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time Physical Activity classification and tracking using wearble sensors","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036431S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4449895,"authors":[{"name":"Yeon Ho Chung","affiliation":["Division of Electronics, Computers and Telecommunications, Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yeon Ho Chung","id":"37087597959"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0983-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4449895","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4449895","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Multiaccess communication","Turbo codes","Multiuser detection","Transmitters","Iterative decoding","Forward error correction","Interference cancellation","Convolutional codes","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","error statistics","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-spread interleaves","random interleaver","bandwidth efficiency","repetition code","BER","interleave division multiple access scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple access scheme","IDMA","interleaver","bandwidth efficiency"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents high-spread (HS) random interleavers based interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) scheme. High-spread feature of a randodecm interleaver offers high-spread characteristics to interleavers and thus produces extrinsic values with low correlation. As interleavers are key components for user separation in the IDMA, the HS interleavers are employed in the IDMA for performance improvement. In addition, by replacing random interleavers with the HS interleavers in the IDMA, bandwidth efficiency is achieved by means of reducing the length of the repetition code. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme of the IDMA with the HS interleavers provides significant BER performance improvement and moderate increase in bandwidth efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4449533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449895","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4446227/4449533/04449895.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and bandwidth efficient interleave-division multiple access scheme with high-spread interleavers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance and bandwidth efficient interleave-division multiple access scheme with high-spread interleavers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4449895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9828353","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4449895/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and bandwidth efficient interleave-division multiple access scheme with high-spread interleavers","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-02062008-00362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050813S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4446227","isNumber":"4449533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4446227","xplore-issue":"4449533","articleId":"4449895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4449896,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel N.
