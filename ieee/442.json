The proposed architecture, able to detect small changes of U.V. absorbance, calculates the analog weighted difference between the gate / source voltages of a floating gate and a reference nMOS transistor fabricated using a single poly technology. The theoretical dependence of the obtained results on both device and circuit parameters has carefully been analyzed. Experimental results show that the circuit offers a valid solution to decrease the error due to temperature variation during operation. Moreover, the measurement procedure is sufficiently quick for neglecting threshold voltage shifts due to mobile charges. Finally, the proposed approach has a particular advantage in integrated system design, since it is compatible with high-density MOS logic.","doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2007.4420011","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interface","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interface","pdfPath":"/iel5/4419989/4419990/04420011.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASI.2007.4420011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4419990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A configurable architecture for the detection of DNA sequences based on a E<sup>2</sup>PROM device","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420011/","displayDocTitle":"A configurable architecture for the detection of DNA sequences based on a E<sup>2</sup>PROM device","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9777768","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4420011/","conferenceDate":"26-27 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A configurable architecture for the detection of DNA sequences based on a E<sup>2</sup>PROM device","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12282007-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064704S","chronDate":"26-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4419989","isNumber":"4419990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4419989","xplore-issue":"4419990","articleId":"4420011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4420017,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In these cases, the lock-in amplifier guarantees the signal recovery from noise (till to 0.1 SNR), provided that the generated small signal, coming from sensor, has a fixed and well-known frequency.

Although many studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in an isolated single source-destination system, applying cooperative relays to a large-scale wireless network remains challenging. We show that a large wireless system with cooperative relays can be penalized by the elevated level of interference it produces. By examining the interdependency between interference management and cooperative relay strategies, the penalty is modeled by an increase in spectrum resource usage and translated into a penalty on single-link throughput. This throughput penalty serves as a reference for designing collaborative relays in isolated scenarios. To mitigate the impact of interference, we present two channel allocation mechanisms for collaborative relay systems with different fairness and utilization trade-offs. Simulation results confirm our analytical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed channel allocation mechanisms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9966283","htmlLink":"/document/4420082/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Impact of Interference on Collaborative Relays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Impact of Interference on Collaborative Relays","sourcePdf":"ttm2008060724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073781S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4494375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4494375","articleId":"4420082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4420084,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Szeliski","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4492939/4420084/4420084-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Richard Szeliski received the PhD degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, in 1988.

It has been known for decades that such problems can be elegantly expressed as Markov random fields, yet the resulting energy minimization problems have been widely viewed as intractable. Algorithms such as graph cuts and loopy belief propagation (LBP) have proven to be very powerful: For example, such methods form the basis for almost all the top-performing stereo methods. However, the trade-offs among different energy minimization algorithms are still not well understood. In this paper, we describe a set of energy minimization benchmarks and use them to compare the solution quality and runtime of several common energy minimization algorithms. We investigate three promising methods-graph cuts, LBP, and tree-reweighted message passing-in addition to the well-known older iterated conditional mode (ICM) algorithm. Our benchmark problems are drawn from published energy functions used for stereo, image stitching, interactive segmentation, and denoising. We also provide a general-purpose software interface that allows vision researchers to easily switch between optimization methods.

The capability of annotating pictures by computers can lead to breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, including Web image search, online picture-sharing communities, and scientific experiments. In this work, the authors developed new optimization and estimation techniques to address two fundamental problems in machine learning. These new techniques serve as the basis for the automatic linguistic indexing of pictures - real time (ALIPR) system of fully automatic and high-speed annotation for online pictures. In particular, the D2-clustering method, in the same spirit as K-Means for vectors, is developed to group objects represented by bags of weighted vectors. Moreover, a generalized mixture modeling technique (kernel smoothing as a special case) for nonvector data is developed using the novel concept of hypothetical local mapping (HLM). ALIPR has been tested by thousands of pictures from an Internet photo-sharing site, unrelated to the source of those pictures used in the training process. Its performance has also been studied at an online demonstration site, where arbitrary users provide pictures of their choices and indicate the correctness of each annotation word. The experimental results show that a single computer processor can suggest annotation terms in real time and with good accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4492939/04420087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492939","startPage":"985","endPage":"1002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Computerized Annotation of Pictures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Computerized Annotation of Pictures","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9966355","pubMedId":"18421105","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4420087/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Computerized Annotation of Pictures","sourcePdf":"ttp2008060985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116008S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4492939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"262","xplore-issue":"4492939","articleId":"4420087","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4420089,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Sun","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA","Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering (ECSE) Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4471806/4420089/4420089-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Sun (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 2007.","He is currently with Marvell Semiconductor, Sunnyvale, CA.

Although the proposed PRBS generator was designed to produce three uncorrelated 12-Gb/s PRBS sequences, measurement results included in this paper have been obtained at only 5 Gb/s due to test setup limitations. The prototype employs a CMOS latch optimized to operate at frequencies close to the of the process and a current-mode logic (CML) MUX with modified active inductor loads for better high-speed large-signal behavior. In order to reduce the power consumption, a quarter-clock rate linear feedback shift register (LFSR) core in a power-efficient parallel architecture has been implemented to minimize the use of power-hungry, high-speed circuitry. Further power reduction has been achieved through the clever partitioning of the system into static logic and CML. In addition, the prototype design produces three uncorrelated 12-Gb/s data streams from a single quarter-rate LFSR core, thereby amortizing the power across multiple channels which lowers the power per channel by 3 times. The total measured power consumption at 5 Gb/s is 131 mW per lane and the calculated figure of merit per lane is 0.84 pJ/bit, which is significantly better than previously published designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4420096/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9992204","volume":"55","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 3<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>5-Gb/s Multilane Low-Power 0.18-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> CMOS Pseudorandom Bit Sequence Generator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>5-Gb/s Multilane Low-Power 0.18-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> CMOS Pseudorandom Bit Sequence Generator","sourcePdf":"55tcsii05-sham.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070448S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4522633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4522633","articleId":"4420096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4420100,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Huang","affiliation":["Center for Microwave and Radio Frequency Technologies, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4522577/4420100/4420100-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Huang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2005 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China, where he is currently working toward the M.S. degree at the Center for Microwave and RF Technologies (CMRFT).","He is currently engaged in the research on modeling of carbon nanotube (CNT) interconnects and CNT-based antennas."]},"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37597442400"},{"name":"Wen-Yan Yin","affiliation":["Center for Microwave and Radio Frequency Technologies, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4522577/4420100/4420100-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Yan Yin (M\u201999\u2013SM\u201901) received the M.Sc. degree in electromagnetic field and microwave technique from Xidian University (XU), Xian, China, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Xian Jiaotong University (XJU), Xian, in 1994.","From 1993 to 1996, he was an Associate Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnic University (NPU), Xian.

It is still a challenging task to accomplish nanomanipulation automatically. In ambient conditions without stringent environmental controls, the task of nanomanipulation requires extensive human intervention to compensate for the spatial uncertainties of the SPM. Among these uncertainties, the thermal drift, which affects spatial resolution, is especially hard to solve because it tends to increase with time, and cannot be compensated simultaneously by feedback from the instrument. In this paper, a novel automatic compensation scheme is introduced to measure and estimate the drift one-step ahead. The scheme can be subsequently utilized to compensate for the thermal drift so that a real-time controller for nanomanipulation can be designed, as if the drift did not exist. Experimental results show that the proposed compensation scheme can predict drift with a small error, and therefore, can be embedded in the controller for manipulation tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4471806/04420215.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2007.915021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2007.915021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Drift Compensation Using Phase Correlation Method for Nanomanipulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Atomic force microscopy","Scanning probe microscopy","Automatic control","Nanofabrication","Humans","Spatial resolution","Feedback","Instruments","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","nanotechnology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic drift compensation","phase correlation method","nanomanipulation","nanofabrication","atomic force microscopy","AFM","SPM","scanning probe microscopy","thermal drift","real-time controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nanomanipulation","neural network (NN)","phase correlation method","scanning probe microscope","thermal drift"]},{"kwd":["nanomanipulation","Scanning Probe Microscope","thermal drift","phase-correlation method","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Drift Compensation Using Phase Correlation Method for Nanomanipulation","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4420215/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920299","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Drift Compensation Using Phase Correlation Method for Nanomanipulation","sourcePdf":"07tnano02-yang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056852S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4471806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4471806","articleId":"4420215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4420252,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Jen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Jen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37578122200"},{"name":"Hung-Huan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Huan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37336128900"},{"name":"Li-Der Chou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Der","lastName":"Chou","id":"37301808400"},{"name":"Yen-Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37677947300"},{"name":"Haw-Yun Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ming Chuan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Haw-Yun","lastName":"Shin","id":"37668602300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3038-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4420252","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1664},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social networking (online)","Servers","Computer architecture","Web services","Wireless fidelity","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive systems","mobile computing","multimedia computing","social sciences computing","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile social network service","cellular telephone","user-location information","personnel profile matching","Wi-Fi distribution network","Web service","multimedia computing","interactive system"]}],"abstract":"The widespread use of cellular telephones and the availability of user-location information are facilitating personalized location-based applications.

An interactive, multimedia, location-based application approach has been proposed to address the needs that frequently arise in the field work of providing supportive social services. Combining location aware search technology and personnel profile matching, the proposed modular and general architecture enables social workers, their colleagues, and other participating professionals to keep each other connected, informed, and organized as a mobile community and a supportive network for those in need. One of the advantages of the proposed architecture is that no new location modules have to be implemented inside the Wi-Fi distribution network or cellular's core network. Furthermore, mash-up of Web services is used; this approach makes the architecture more modular and easier to leverage existing web services.

Most commercial devices implement on-chip storage by providing several large arrays embedded into the FPGA. Scholars have done some research on implementing user logic memory models with single-port and dual-port physical arrays. However, their work is based on the assumption that user memory models are either single-port or dual- port. Thus, we need an efficient way to implement import memory on FPGA considering that most FPGA vendors do not provide N-port physical arrays (Nges3). In this paper, a novel hierarchical N-port memory architecture, which fits LUT-based FPGAs, is proposed. The principle of hierarchical architecture is mapping distributed memory resources of LUT as l-port Memory Banks. Data in different Memory Banks can be accessed simultaneously. Besides, extend port importance hierarchy (EPIH) algorithm is proposed for basic conflict handling, while block access control (BAC) algorithm is proposed for reducing conflict when processors carry block read/write. Experiment on Xilinx Virtex-II chips shows that this design saves almost 88% LUT resources compared to implementation of N ports in each memory cell.","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420216/4420217/04420253.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Architecture of N-Port Memory Based on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2007.154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2007.154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical Architecture of N-Port Memory Based on FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9893012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4420253/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical Architecture of N-Port Memory Based on FPGA","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30380157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060171S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420216","isNumber":"4420217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420216","xplore-issue":"4420217","articleId":"4420253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4420331,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406658900"},{"name":"Guangcheng Xi","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Guangcheng","lastName":"Xi","id":"37688014200"},{"name":"Yanwei Xing","affiliation":["GuangAnMen Hospital, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yanwei","lastName":"Xing","id":"37573563500"},{"name":"Jie Wang","affiliation":["GuangAnMen Hospital, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089060647"},{"name":"Chenglong Zheng","affiliation":["Orthopedics Traumatology, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China"],"firstName":"Chenglong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37402253400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3038-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4420331","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Neural networks","Clustering algorithms","Cardiac disease","Medical diagnostic imaging","Arteries","Angiography","Partitioning algorithms","Neurons","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angiocardiography","cardiovascular system","diseases","medical diagnostic computing","neural nets","pattern clustering","stochastic processes","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised multivalued stochastic neural network algorithm","coronary heart disease data","pattern clustering","clinical epidemiology survey","coronary artery angiography","medical diagnostic computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420331","abstract":"Clustering of attributes in unsupervised medical data presents a major challenge for many researchers. In this paper We carry out a clinical epidemiology survey of Coronary Heart Disease and obtain 1069 cases. Each case is certainly a CHD case based on the evidence from Coronary Artery Angiography. It includes 78 symptoms and is diagnosed by TCM mentors as syndrome or syndrome combinations. We proposed an unsupervised stochastic neural network algorithm to partition 78 symptoms into several clusters. Each cluster is diagnosed by TCM mentor as syndrome and is clinically verified. The unsupervised stochastic neural network with multi-valued neurons implements clustering of attributes in short duration and obtains seven clusters in the data. The seven clusters correspond to seven syndromes in TCM verified by TCM mentors, which indicates that the cluster is successful and the data surveyed is of high quality, The investigation of stochastic neural network to CHD data to retrieve syndromes in CHD successfully bridges gap between western medicine and TCM.

As the technique that inserts watermarks uniformly in every image in different color spaces causes color alterations and image quality deterioration, watermarks should be selectively inserted in visually less sensitive places. In addition, watermark insertion is needed in devices with various features such as computers, PDAs and mobile phones as users want to use multimedia services on those devices. This paper suggests a watermark insertion technique for color images by selecting frequencies to insert watermarks in Y components that correspond to spatial locations, which are less sensitive to chrominance signals, and creating insertion keys that consider properties of frequency coefficients in multi-level structures. Therefore, insertion, invisibility and robustness of watermarks against JPEG compression for multimedia contents in devices with various performances can be quaranteed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2007.415","startPage":"854","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420216/4420217/04420367.pdf","endPage":"860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2007.415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420367/","displayDocTitle":"Color Images Watermarking of Multi-Level Structure for Multimedia Services","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4420367/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9893125","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Images Watermarking of Multi-Level Structure for Multimedia Services","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30380854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058643S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420216","isNumber":"4420217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4420217","articleId":"4420367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4420379,"authors":[{"name":"Yafei Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Cao","id":"37832740700"},{"name":"Dawei Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279548300"},{"name":"Sikun Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, China"],"firstName":"Sikun","lastName":"Li","id":"37279611800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3038-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4420379","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420379","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Network-on-a-chip","Delay","Throughput","Computer architecture","System-on-a-chip","Algorithm design and analysis","Traffic control","Network topology","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","logic design","network topology","system buses","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crossbar bus synthesis","transaction level modeling","genetic algorithm","SoC","system-on-chip","slave module clustering","static communication traffic balancing algorithm","communication delay constraint","optimal partial crossbar bus topology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2007.74","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420216/4420217/04420379.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","startPage":"931","endPage":"936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2007.74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crossbar Bus Synthesis on Transaction Level Using Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"The communication architectures in modern SoCs (system-on-chip) not only impact the performance of SoC considerably, but also consume a large amount of the design cycle.

In this paper, we develop a method for recognizing 3D face images by combining face component; eyes, cheek, mouth, and nose. For the proposed approach, the first step uses face curvatures which present the facial features for 3D face images, after normalization using the SVD. As a result of this process, we obtain curvature feature for each component range face. Fuzzy neural network, PCA, and Fisherface methods are then applied to each component range face. The reason for adapting PCA and Fisherface method is that the methods maintain the surface attribute for face curvature, even though they can generate reduced image dimension. In the last step, the aggregation of the individual classifiers using the fuzzy integral is explained for each component. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach has outstanding classification performance compared to other methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2007.193","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420216/4420217/04420441.pdf","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1339","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2007.193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Neural Networks and Fuzzy Integral Approach to Curvature-Based Component Range Facial Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Neural Networks and Fuzzy Integral Approach to Curvature-Based Component Range Facial Recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9893199","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4420441/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Neural Networks and Fuzzy Integral Approach to Curvature-Based Component Range Facial Recognition","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30381334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063265S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420216","isNumber":"4420217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420216","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4420217","articleId":"4420441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4420453,"authors":[{"name":"Hsio-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Department of Finance, Ching Yun University of Technology, Jungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsio-Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37695261700"},{"name":"Yu-Fang Juan","affiliation":["Institute of Information Management, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Fang","lastName":"Juan","id":"37824847100"},{"name":"An-Pin Chen","firstName":"An-Pin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277939300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3038-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4420453","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420453","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Predictive models","Stock markets","Econometrics","Artificial intelligence","Economic forecasting","Environmental economics","Mathematical model","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","data mining","economic forecasting","investment","neural nets","pattern classification","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid intelligent trading approach","Taiwan stock index trend forecasting","econometrics","real stock market behaviors","knowledge discovery","artificial intelligence models","financial analysis","extended classifier system","backpropagation neural network","XCS-neural-network based trading system","investment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2007.374","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420216/4420217/04420453.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","startPage":"1408","endPage":"1416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2007.374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Intelligent Trading Approach XCS Neural Network Model for Taiwan Stock Index Trend Forecasting","abstract":"Econometricians build precise hypotheses in advance when they use econometric models to discuss changing stock market trends. However, baffled by these unreasonable hypotheses, economics generally cannot effectively explain real stock market behaviors using mathematical models. Therefore, this study attempts to use genetic theories to produce a rule base that can be adapted to stock market behaviors, and then re-learns it to refine those rules, hopefully discovering knowledge hidden in the stock market. Artificial intelligence models recently have been frequently applied in financial analysis. Compared with econometric models, which require numerous hypotheses and suffer various other limitations, artificial intelligence models are more flexible, able to solve any nonlinear problems, and more suitable for analyzing dynamic environments such as stock markets. This study combines two artificial intelligence technologies: the extended classifier system and backpropagation neural network to establish a XCS-neural-network based trading system, and this system is then used to identify environmental patterns and predict the values of the test set. Experiments reveal that all test data in this study have accuracy rates exceeding 50%. Therefore, this study confidently concludes that the proposed system can help investors make more precise investment decisions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420453/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9893210","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4420453/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Intelligent Trading Approach XCS Neural Network Model for Taiwan Stock Index Trend Forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Intelligent Trading Approach XCS Neural Network Model for Taiwan Stock Index Trend Forecasting","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30381408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056952S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420216","isNumber":"4420217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4420217","articleId":"4420453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4420507,"authors":[{"name":"Kou Wei","affiliation":["Beijing Microelectronics Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Kou","lastName":"Wei","id":"37826569700"},{"name":"Wen Zhiping","affiliation":["Beijing Microelectronics Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Zhiping","id":"37629179600"},{"name":"Zhang Yongxue","affiliation":["Beijing Microelectronics Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yongxue","id":"37841500100"},{"name":"Bi Bo","affiliation":["Beijing Microelectronics Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Bi","lastName":"Bo","id":"37824942900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3038-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4420507","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Global Positioning System","Frequency domain analysis","Computational modeling","Computational complexity","Search methods","Signal sampling","Information technology","Bismuth","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","Global Positioning System","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compress sampling algorithm","GPS signal acquisition","fast Fourier transform","averaging correlation technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420507","doi":"10.1109/ICCIT.2007.98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2007.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420217","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420216/4420217/04420507.pdf","startPage":"1770","endPage":"1774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Compress Sampling Algorithm for FFT-based GPS Signal Acquisition","abstract":"Presently FFT usage in GPS receivers has been a topic of extensive study and many improved FFT-based acquisition methods with averaging correlation technique also have emerged.

In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet transform based approach to achieve the image capture and fusion of 3D surface texture. There are two components in real-world surface textures - rough surface geometry properties and its reflectance properties. 3D surface textures are different from 2D textures as their appearing can vary dramatically with different illumination conditions. A novel wavelet transform based scheme is employed in this paper. Every saliency of wavelet decomposition coefficient is measured in each original input image. The saliency value visually reflects the meaningful contents of the wavelet decomposition coefficients, and it's consistent with human visual perception too. This novel scheme aims to preserve the full content values and retain the meaningful information with respect to human visualization and perception. In addition, the fusion of 3D surface texture composes both the albedo (e.g. color) and geometry properties (e.g. height or gradient map), therefore a new fusion image of the 3D surface texture under arbitrary illuminant direction can be generated. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only captures and fusions 3D surface texture under arbitrary illumination directions, but also has the ability to retain the surface geometry structures and preserve perceptual features in the image.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420623/4420624/04420690.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4420690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4420690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image capture and fusion of 3d surface texture using wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","Surface texture","Wavelet transforms","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Geometry","Layout","Lighting","Humans","Image fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image fusion","image texture","surface fitting","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","3D surface texture","image fusion","image capture","rough surface geometry","wavelet decomposition coefficient","human visual perception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image fusion","3D surface textures","wavelet decomposition","saliency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image capture and fusion of 3d surface texture using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4420690/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891600","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image capture and fusion of 3d surface texture using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080707S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420623","isNumber":"4420624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420623","xplore-issue":"4420624","articleId":"4420690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4420718,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Lu","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yang Lu","id":"37087475576"},{"name":"Z.W.

Traditional algorithms of image deburring have some limits, such as assumption of generalized stationary process and calculating complexity etc in their application. Based on the data of degraded image and original image as trained samples of the RBF network, the similarly degraded image may be restored through recording the reverse process. Combining wavelet transform with neural network, through wavelet decomposition of degraded image and original image, images of different low frequency resolution may be obtained; thus, multi-resolution image pyramids of the two sample images can be constructed. The RBF network structure may be optimized by levels through the sample images trained from the top to the bottom of the pyramid, and the weights obtained from the upper level were used as the original weights of the next level. The image restoration thus can be conducted by the eventually obtained optimized network.

Wavelet transform is utilized to extract feature vectors for various power quality disturbances based on multi-resolution analysis. The decomposition signal is divided into 5 equal length bins in each level. Root mean square (RMS) value of the wavelet coefficients that fall within that bin is regarded as a dimension of feature vectors. These feature vectors are applied to a probabilistic neural network for training and testing. Evolutionary algorithm is used to in this paper as a multivariate optimization scheme for finding multiple sigma values in estimation of probabilistic density function. One of the major virtue of PNN stems from its modular architecture design, then it can be easily extended adapt to a changing environment by appropriate chromosomes and generations. We examined that different decomposition levels of wavelet transform are concerned with the classifier accuracy, and the performance of classification is minor distinction with different wavelet families under the condition of same decomposition level.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4420768","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420623/4420716/04420768.pdf","startPage":"746","endPage":"750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4420768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel probabilistic neural network system for power quality classification based on different wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4420768/","displayDocTitle":"A novel probabilistic neural network system for power quality classification based on different wavelet transform","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891384","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4420768/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel probabilistic neural network system for power quality classification based on different wavelet transform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051936S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420623","isNumber":"4420716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420623","xplore-issue":"4420716","articleId":"4420768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4420773,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Xue","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Xue","id":"37087154149"},{"name":"Ke Liu","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ke Liu","id":"37087265221"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1065-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1066-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"4420773","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4420773","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Networked control systems","Neural networks","Predictive control","Control systems","Neurofeedback","Stability","Hydraulic actuators","Delay systems","Delay effects","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","feedback","linear systems","neurocontrollers","predictive control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-sampling networked control system","neural network prediction","linear time-invariant normal controlled plant","network-induced delay time","predictive error bound","predictive control value","predictive feedback value","stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked control system","event-time driven","variable-sampling","neural network prediction"]}],"abstract":"For linear time-invariant normal controlled plant, under the assumption that controller and actuator adopt the method of event-time driven the system become a variable-sampling networked control system.

The notion of N-inference F-diagnosability was formulated to characterize the class of diagnosable systems in this framework. This property ensures that the ambiguity levels of diagnosis decisions are at most N. A system is said to be inference F-diagnosable if it is N-inference F-diagnosable for some N, i.e., if the number of levels of inferencing required is bounded. In this paper we answer an open question that even in the setting of finite-state plant and specification models, the number of levels of inferencing required is in general unbounded. The following additional results are obtained. We show that the class of N-inference F-diagnosable systems increases strictly monotonically as the parameter N is increased. We also show that the inference F-diagnosability is strictly stronger than the decentralized-diagnosability.","doi":"10.1109/SICE.2007.4421041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SICE.2007.4421041","publicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420927/4420928/04421041.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inference-diagnosability: Nonconvergence and other complexity results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Inference-diagnosability: Nonconvergence and other complexity results","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4421041/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9853517","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421041/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inference-diagnosability: Nonconvergence and other complexity results","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072007-000113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095212S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420927","isNumber":"4420928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420927","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4420928","articleId":"4421041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICEIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4421042,"authors":[{"name":"Shinkichi Inagaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Shinkichi Inagaki","id":"37302232800"},{"name":"Tatsuya Suzuki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Tatsuya Suzuki","id":"37276136600"},{"name":"Mitsuo Saito","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Mitsuo Saito","id":"37830545100"},{"name":"Takeshi Aoki","affiliation":["Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Takeshi Aoki","id":"37349982800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-27-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4421042","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Bayesian methods","Control systems","Programmable control","Electrical equipment industry","Computer architecture","Large-scale systems","Automatic control","Electronic mail","Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Markov processes","programmable controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","event-driven system","Bayesian network","timed Markov model","programmable logic controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized Fault Diagnosis","Bayesian Network","Timed Markov Model","Event-Driven System"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local/global fault diagnosis of Event-Driven Systems based on Bayesian Network and Timed Markov Mode","abstract":"This paper presents a new decentralized (local/global) fault diagnosis strategy for the event-driven controlled systems such as the programmable logic controller (PLC). First of all, the controlled plant is decomposed into some subsystems, and the global diagnosis is formulated using the Bayesian network (BN), which represents the causal relationship between the fault and observation in subsystems. Second, the local diagnoser is developed using the conventional timed Markov model (TMM), and the local diagnosis results are used to specify the conditional probability assigned to each arc in the BN. By exploiting the decentralized diagnosis architecture, the computational burden for the diagnosis can be distributed to the subsystems. As the result, large scale diagnosis problems in the practical situation can be solved. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed strategy is verified through some experimental results of an automatic transfer line.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421042","publicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420927/4420928/04421042.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SICE.2007.4421042","startPage":"540","endPage":"545","doi":"10.1109/SICE.2007.4421042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Local/global fault diagnosis of Event-Driven Systems based on Bayesian Network and Timed Markov Mode","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4421042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9853518","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local/global fault diagnosis of Event-Driven Systems based on Bayesian Network and Timed Markov Mode","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072007-000114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078705S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420927","isNumber":"4420928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420927","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4420928","articleId":"4421042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4421073,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Kok Liang","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics and Physico-Informatics, Keio University, Japan"],"lastName":"Tan Kok Liang","id":"37087348484"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics and Physico-Informatics, Keio University, Japan"],"lastName":"Toshiyuki Tanaka","id":"37087298162"},{"name":"Hidetoshi Nakamura","affiliation":["Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Electric Power Hospital, Japan"],"lastName":"Hidetoshi Nakamura","id":"37087386438"},{"name":"Akitoshi Ishizaka","affiliation":["Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, Keio University, Japan"],"lastName":"Akitoshi Ishizaka","id":"37087523803"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-27-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4421073","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computer aided diagnosis","Computed tomography","Lungs","Diseases","Carbon dioxide","Image segmentation","X-rays","Spirals","Bronchoscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","diseases","feature extraction","image classification","lung","medical image processing","neural nets","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based computer-aided diagnosis","CT lung image","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","emphysema","spirometry","X-rays","spiral chest CT-scan","bronchoscopy","pulse oximetry","arterial blood gas sampling","digital image processing","feature extraction","image classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","region by region","neural network","emphysema"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421073","abstract":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a disease in which the airways and tiny air sacs (alveoli) inside the lungs are partially obstructed or destroyed. The result is labored breathing. There are varying degrees of this illness, and different names for them, but it all comes back to damaged airways and air sacs. Emphysema is what occurs as more and more of the walls between air sacs get destroyed. Instead of having lots of little sacs, the sacs break up and what is left are larger sacs. These bigger sacs have less surface area for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide than the tiny ones. Poor exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide causes shortness of breath. At present, diagnosis of emphysema is done by using spirometry, X-rays, spiral chest CT-scan, bronchoscopy, pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas sampling. This paper proposes a computer-aided diagnostic system for emphysema that segments the lungs into multiple square regions and classifies the segmented regions into 5 classes of severity. The proposed algorithm is divided into three stages: 1. digital image processing, 2. feature extraction, and 3. classification using neural network (NN). The aim of this paper is to analyze the severity of the lungs region by region along with NN classification.","doi":"10.1109/SICE.2007.4421073","startPage":"703","endPage":"709","publicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SICE.2007.4421073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420928","displayPublicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420927/4420928/04421073.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based computer-aided diagnosis of emphysema using CT lung images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421073/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network based computer-aided diagnosis of emphysema using CT lung images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4421073/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9853549","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based computer-aided diagnosis of emphysema using CT lung images","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072007-000145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047273S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420927","isNumber":"4420928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420927","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4420928","articleId":"4421073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICEIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4421092,"authors":[{"name":"Yohei Okada","affiliation":["Department of Production Systems Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Okada","id":"37088306253"},{"name":"Yuji Yamakawa","affiliation":["Department of Information Physics and Computing, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Yamakawa","id":"37569560500"},{"name":"Takanori Yamazaki","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Oyama National College of Technology, Oyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takanori","lastName":"Yamazaki","id":"37277508300"},{"name":"Shigeru Kurosu","affiliation":["Crotech Research Institute, Chikusei, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Kurosu","id":"37277522300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-27-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4421092","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":877},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421092","abstract":"In the previous paper, we proposed the tuning method of PI controller for a plant model described by a first-order lag plus deadtime system based on a desired damping, and demonstrated its effectiveness and limitation by simulation studies. The PI parameters have been adjusted so that their influence on the damping was transparent. It is well known that the derivative action is effective in obtaining the desired damping. In this paper, of particular interest to us is how to tune PID controller to suppress overshoot. In tuning controllers it is often convenient to specify a damping coefficient of the closed system. For PID control, the integral time T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sub>\n and the derivative time Td are kept fixed to degenerate the order of the closed-loop transfer function. This can be easily led to pole-zero cancellation. Thus, the only one parameter of PID controller to be adjusted now becomes the proportional gain k\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n. It can be concluded that the PID controller provides a much better response than the PI controller presented last year. The resultant graphical comparisons document how to give a guide line for tuning of PID controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-term control","Damping","Tuning","Control systems","Proportional control","Transfer functions","PD control","Pi control","Production systems","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","poles and zeros","three-term control","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuning method","PID controller","first-order lag plus deadtime system","desired damping coefficient","tuning controllers","closed-loop transfer function","pole-zero cancellation","PI controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PID control","first-order lag plus deadtime system","Pad\u00e9 approximation","poles-zeros cancellation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SICE.2007.4421092","startPage":"795","endPage":"799","publicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420927/4420928/04421092.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SICE.2007.4421092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning method of PID controller for desired damping coefficient","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tuning method of PID controller for desired damping coefficient","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9853568","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4421092/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning method of PID controller for desired damping coefficient","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072007-000164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04621S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420927","isNumber":"4420928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420927","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4420928","articleId":"4421092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICEIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4421126,"authors":[{"name":"Yongtao Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"lastName":"Yongtao Li","id":"37087747334"},{"name":"Tai Tanaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"lastName":"Tai Tanaka","id":"37088142192"},{"name":"Shigetoshi Nara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"lastName":"Shigetoshi Nara","id":"37087728082"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-27-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4421126","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Robot sensing systems","Chaos","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Mobile robots","Computer simulation","Acoustic sensors","Hardware","Biological systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","chaos","large-scale systems","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","recurrent neural nets","robot dynamics","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["roving robot control","chaotic dynamics","quasi-layered recurrent neural network","sensing neurons","driving neurons","2D mazes","computer simulations","hardware implementation","complex control","adaptive control","ill-posed problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["roving robot","chaotic dynamics","quasi-layered RNN","complex control","adaptive control","ill-posed problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421126","abstract":"We propose a quasi-layered recurrent neural network consisting of sensing neurons (upper layer) and driving neurons (lower layer).

The control input is given by the sum of the output of the simple adaptive controller and the sum of the outputs of the parallel small-scale neural networks. The parallel small-scale neural networks are used to compensate the nonlinearity of plant dynamics that is not taken into consideration in the usual SAC. The role of the parallel smallscale neural networks is to construct a linearized model by minimizing the output error caused by nonlinearities in the control systems.

In the present paper, the authors at first show application of evolutionary multi-objective optimization to design traffic-sensitive MCE controller. The controller for MCE is optimized for different traffic conditions by combining the multi-objective optimization with the exemplar-based policy (EBP) representation that has adequate flexibility and generalization ability as a controller. And a policy visualization method is proposed for analyzing how the traffic-sensitive EBP works.","doi":"10.1109/SICE.2007.4421440","startPage":"2655","endPage":"2662","publicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SICE.2007.4421440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4420928","displayPublicationTitle":"SICE Annual Conference 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420927/4420928/04421440.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-sensitive controllers for multi-car elevators; design, multi-objective optimization and analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421440/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Traffic-sensitive controllers for multi-car elevators; design, multi-objective optimization and analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4421440/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9853913","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-sensitive controllers for multi-car elevators; design, multi-objective optimization and analysis","confLoc":"Takamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12072007-000512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060968S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420927","isNumber":"4420928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420927","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4420928","articleId":"4421440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SICEIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4421447,"authors":[{"name":"Joon-Yong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joon-Yong Lee","id":"38185800200"},{"name":"Min-Soeng Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Min-Soeng Kim","id":"37291555300"},{"name":"Cheol-Taek Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Cheol-Taek Kim","id":"37292322600"},{"name":"Ju-Jang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ju-Jang Lee","id":"37280306200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-907764-27-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4421447","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"abstract":"In this paper, we experimented how the performance of compact genetic algorithms (cGAs) become different according to two competitive encoding schemes: binary encoding and gray encoding scheme.

To solve this problem, we propose an approach based on minimum spanning tree (MST) clustering with new distance measures. First, the connected components of the document image are grouped into a tree by MST clustering with a new distance measure. The edges of the tree are then dynamically cut to form text lines by using a new objective function for finding the number of clusters. This approach is totally parameter-free and can apply to various documents with multi-skewed and curved lines.

Firstly, a help operator was used to help individuals of population according to the given probability. Secondly, the genetic individuals were separated into male individuals and female individuals, and consanguinity was fused into individuals. Two individuals with different sex could reproduce the next generation only if they were distant consanguinity individuals. Based on this improved genetic algorithm, an evolved neural network algorithm named IGA-BP algorithm was proposed. In this algorithm, genetic algorithm was used to optimize and design the structure, the initial weights and thresholds, the training ratio and momentum factor of neural network roundly. The disadvantage of neural networks that their structure and parameters were decided stochastically or by one\u2019s experience was overcome in this way, and the surge of algorithm was restrained. IGA-BP algorithm was used to recognize handwritten numerals, a recognition model of handwritten numerals based on BP neural network was found, and the handwritten numeral recognition scheme based on IGA-BP algorithm was proposed. The experimental results show that this algorithm is better than SGA-BP algorithm and traditional BP algorithm in both speed and precision of convergence, We can obtain a better recognition effect using this algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4421630","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1276","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420623/4421569/04421630.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4421630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4421569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Handwritten Numeral Recognition Method Based on Improved Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Convergence","Character recognition","Algorithm design and analysis","Pattern recognition","Surges","Wavelet analysis","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convergence","genetic algorithms","handwritten character recognition","neural nets","probability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten numeral recognition method","neural network","convergence speed","help operator","probability","improved genetic algorithm-backpropagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Neural network","BP algorithm","Handwritten numeral recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Research on Handwritten Numeral Recognition Method Based on Improved Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4421630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891285","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Handwritten Numeral Recognition Method Based on Improved Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053782S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420623","isNumber":"4421569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420623","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4421569","articleId":"4421630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4421699,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-Quan Cheng","affiliation":["School of Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Guang-Quan Cheng","id":"37534772000"},{"name":"Li-Zhi Cheng","affiliation":["School of Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Li-Zhi Cheng","id":"37336762500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1065-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1066-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"4421699","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis","Filtering","Wavelet domain","Image texture","Transform coding","Interpolation","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","filtering theory","image coding","image representation","image resolution","image texture","interpolation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","adaptive wavelet transform","image texture","directional wavelet filtering","image coding","natural image representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image compression","Adaptive wavelet transform","Image texture","Direction predict","Half-pixel interpolation"]}],"abstract":"The conventional two-dimensional wavelet transform is performed through one-dimensional filtering in horizontal and vertical directions, which fails to provide an effective representation for directional features, while natural images are rich in texture and directional features.

Partitioning the image based on local content, predicting the texture direction of local image, keeping the orthogonal property, applying directional wavelet filtering, we achieve our method by lifting structure with in-place operation. In order to protect the texture information, we get half-pixel by interpolating along predicted direction. The method can be used to construct a new image coder with the EBCOT that was adopted in JPEG2000, coding the coefficients and directional information respectively. The result of our method is more effective for representation of natural images.

The execution speed of the proposed algorithm is increased at least twice as conventional wavelet transform method.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4421712","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420623/4421676/04421712.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4421712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4421676","startPage":"1624","endPage":"1629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Roller eccentricity signal identification and self-adaptive control based on second generation wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Roller eccentricity signal identification and self-adaptive control based on second generation wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421712/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891491","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4421712/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Roller eccentricity signal identification and self-adaptive control based on second generation wavelet transform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272007-00036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056747S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420623","isNumber":"4421676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420623","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4421676","articleId":"4421712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4421715,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Lin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jie Lin","id":"37675006100"},{"name":"Jian-Ping Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jian-Ping Li","id":"37405662600"},{"name":"Ming Ji","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"lastName":"Ming Ji","id":"37824228700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1065-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1066-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"4421715","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Face recognition","Adaptation model","Testing","Facial features","Wavelet analysis","Associative memory","Computational modeling","Data mining","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","face recognition","stability","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust face recognition","wavelet features","model adaptation","multiscale wavelet representations","linear associative memory method","simulated testing data","space complexity","MIT-CBCL face database","Olivetti Research Laboratory face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compensation","face recognition","model adaptation","wavelet"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a face recognition algorithm based on multiscale wavelet representations and model adaptation is proposed.

The amplitude spectral surface of characteristic waveforms is decomposed into a series of reduced time resolution surfaces with B-spline biorthogonal wavelet filter banks. This multi-scale characteristic leads to more efficient quantization by exploiting each surface's perceptual importance and inherent transmission rate requirements. At the CWI encoder, the complex alignment operation is removed and the amplitude spectrum is decomposed without phase spectrum. At the decoder, different scale space is reconstructed separately and random or fixed phase is combined to the spectrum based on voiced degree. Compared with traditional CWI algorithm using lowpass filtering CW decomposition, the proposed WT-CWI algorithm can get lower coding rate and improve coding result. Subjective A-B listening tests indicate that the synthesis speech quality of the proposed 3.3kbps WT-CWI coding algorithm is far better than that of traditional 4.25kbit/s CWI speech coder.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4420623/4421676/04421718.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"411","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4421718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4421718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4421676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3.3kbps CWI speech coding algorithm based on biothogonal wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech coding","Wavelet transforms","Speech synthesis","Surface waves","Filtering algorithms","Interpolation","Spline","Filter bank","Quantization","Surface reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","decoding","interpolation","quantisation (signal)","spectral analysis","speech coding","splines (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CWI speech coding algorithm","biothogonal wavelet transform","characteristic waveform interpolation","amplitude spectral surface","reduced time resolution surfaces","B-spline biorthogonal wavelet filter banks","signal quantization","CWI encoder","decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet transform","waveform interpolation","characteristic waveform decomposition","voiced degree"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A 3.3kbps CWI speech coding algorithm based on biothogonal wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4421718/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891337","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3.3kbps CWI speech coding algorithm based on biothogonal wavelet transform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272007-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05253S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4420623","isNumber":"4421676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4420623","xplore-issue":"4421676","articleId":"4421718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4421737,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Guo Yang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China","Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Shu-Guo Yang","id":"37834664300"},{"name":"Chun-Xia Li","affiliation":["Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Chun-Xia Li","id":"37833485000"},{"name":"Sheng-He Sun","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Sheng-He Sun","id":"37421486400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1065-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1066-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"4421737","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Discrete wavelet transforms","Cryptography","Robustness","Watermarking","Information security","Information technology","Wavelet coefficients","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","cryptography","data encapsulation","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["text information hiding","chaotic map","BCH code","DWT domain","carrier image","information security","network technology","information technology","character encoding","ASCII code","plaintext information code","chaotic encryption","encrypted information","ciphertext information","wavelet coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Text information","chaotic map","ASCII code","BCH code","DWT"]}],"abstract":"The issue of Information security in the transmitting process becomes more and more urgent with the development of the network technology and the information technology.

In this paper, a novel method of implementing wavelet transform using switched-current (SI) technology is presented. Analog VLSI implementation procedure mainly involves the construction of a bank of filters whose impulse responses are the basic wavelet function and its dilations. SI circuits are well suited for this application since the dilation constant across different scales of the transform can be implemented and controlled by the clock frequency precisely. Therefore, the main focus just is on the SI circuit implementation of the basic wavelet function filter. The Marr wavelet is selected as an example with construction procedure and structure of SI circuits elaborated, in which the second-generation SI circuit is employed.

In this paper, region energy and cousin correlation are defined to represent the neighbors and cousins information, respectively. Salience measure, as the combination of region energy and cousin correlation, is defined to obtain fused coefficients in the high-frequency NSCT domain.

However, privacy regulations and other privacy concerns may prevent data owners from sharing information for data analysis. To resolve this challenging problem, data owners must design a solution that meets privacy requirements and guarantees valid data clustering results. To achieve this dual goal, we introduce a new method for privacy-preserving clustering based on the probability distributed model for clustering. This paper proposes square wave-based clustering model, gauss distribution-based clustering model and the multivariate normal distribution-based clustering model based on the information provided by the K-means clustering result separately. And we mainly show the correctness and feasibility of the sampled data for clustering by experiment. This new preserving technique can be used not only for distributed clustering, but also for simultaneous clustering rule and data hiding.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Data privacy","Data mining","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Protection","Conference management","Technology management","Engineering management","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data encapsulation","data mining","data privacy","Gaussian distribution","normal distribution","pattern clustering","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed model based sampling technique","privacy preserving clustering","data mining","data analysis","privacy requirements","data clustering","probability distributed model","square wave-based clustering model","gauss distribution-based clustering model","multivariate normal distribution-based","K-means clustering","data hiding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["density-based clustering","distribution model","privacy preserving clustering","sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMSE.2007.4421846","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4421806/4421807/04421846.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4421807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSE.2007.4421846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Model Based Sampling Technique for Privacy Preserving Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Model Based Sampling Technique for Privacy Preserving Clustering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421846/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4421846/","accessionNumber":"9849729","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Model Based Sampling Technique for Privacy Preserving Clustering","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMSE-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060445S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4421806","isNumber":"4421807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4421806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4421807","articleId":"4421846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TEC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4421877,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Ai-bing","affiliation":["School of Management, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Ai-bing","id":"38272718600"},{"name":"Ma Liang","affiliation":["School of Management, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Liang","id":"37402873500"},{"name":"Xiong Xiao-hua","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Shanghai Second Polytechnic University, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Xiao-hua","id":"38271532400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-7-5603-2278-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-88358-080-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1847"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1855"}],"articleNumber":"4421877","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tree graphs","Roads","Costs","Computer network management","Conference management","Technology management","Engineering management","Computer networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Electronic components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","operations research","optimisation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degree-constrained minimum spanning tree","graph","operational research","NP-hard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["algorithm","degree-constrained minimum spanning tree","minimum spanning tree"]}],"abstract":"The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph defines the cheapest subset of edges that keeps the graph in one connected component which is a classic problem in operational research (OR) with important applications in network design. The degree-constrained minimum spanning tree (DCMST) is a special case of MST, which is also an important problem in network design. It consists of finding a spanning tree whose nodes do not exceed a given maximum degree and whose total edge length is minimum. It is known that computing the DCMST is NP-hard. We design a new algorithm for DCMST. At first, the algorithm employs the properties of the problem to remove the pendant vertexes (vertexes of degree 1) from the graph. Then by adding edges to an empty graph in a setting order, the algorithm gets a tree satisfying all the constraints of DCMST. Finally, a better solution comes into being by swapping the edges. This paper also gives an example to demonstrate the principle and the process of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICMSE.2007.4421877","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4421806/4421807/04421877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSE.2007.4421877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4421807","startPage":"381","endPage":"386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Degree-constrained Minimum Spanning Tree with a New Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Solving Degree-constrained Minimum Spanning Tree with a New Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421877/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9849760","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4421877/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Degree-constrained Minimum Spanning Tree with a New Algorithm","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMSE-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068523S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4421806","isNumber":"4421807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4421806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4421807","articleId":"4421877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TEC","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4421881,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Bai-qing","affiliation":["School of Management, Harbin Institute of Technology, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Bai-qing","id":"37073542100"},{"name":"Zhang Can-xin","affiliation":["School of Management, Harbin Engineering of Technology, China","School of Management, Harbin Engineering University, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Can-xin","id":"38270259400"},{"name":"Chen Xiao-dong","affiliation":["School of International Relations of Economics and Trade, Harbin Institute of Technology, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Xiao-dong","id":"38274192100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-7-5603-2278-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-88358-080-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1847"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1855"}],"articleNumber":"4421881","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neural network hardware","Circuits","Redundancy","Conference management","Technology management","Engineering management","Multi-layer neural network","Testing","Immune system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","logic design","neural chips","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network redundancy","stimulant integrate circuit","multilayer forward neural network","layer-training algorithm","single parameter dynamic searching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","redundancy","SPDS algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4421881","abstract":"The network redundancy is the key problem in the realization of the stimulant integrate circuit using multi-layer forward neural network. It is well known that the weights of the neural network are usually established by the changeable resistances, whose limited range leads to the fixed domain of the weights. This means that a subjected condition of the feasible domain of the weights is added to the neural network. The method of deriving the weights and the layer-training algorithm does well in training neural network, but it has the disadvantages of the slow speed of convergence, as well as the weights and threshold values tend to be out of the feasible domain. Deriving the weights and the layer-training algorithm seems to be good, but it can't always keep the weights in the feable domain. The subjected SPDS algorithm based on the idea of circulating the coordinate in turns works well and it assures all the network parameters keep in the feasible domain for all the time. Furthermore, the training requirement can be realized in relatively short time, and it is fit for hardware design of neural network. The thesis makes a deep analysis of the subjected SPDS algorithm, and presents the method to improve its training speed,and numerical experimentation tests its validity.","doi":"10.1109/ICMSE.2007.4421881","pdfPath":"/iel5/4421806/4421807/04421881.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"409","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSE.2007.4421881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4421807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Subjected SPDS Algorithm of Forward Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4421881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Subjected SPDS Algorithm of Forward Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9849764","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4421881/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Subjected SPDS Algorithm of Forward Neural Network","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICMSE-00-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066065S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4421806","isNumber":"4421807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4421806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4421807","articleId":"4421881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TEC","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4422254,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Wireless sensor networks are characterized by the ad-hoc distribution in an area of many tiny sensor devices. Because these networks often must operate in areas without and pre existing infrastructure, they are typically required to operate for extended periods of time on single battery charge. Thus, low power design techniques are important technologies for wireless sensor networks. Towards this goal, several techniques and novel ideas are presented for improving sensitivity and reducing power requirements. Through the application of these techniques, a 1.0 V, 1 mW low power OOK fully integrated receiver implemented using 0.13 mum CMOS technology is presented. The chip receives a RF signal with a sensitivity of -90 dBm at a data rate of 1 Mbps at 2.2 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/ISDRS.2007.4422349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDRS.2007.4422349","publicationTitle":"2007 International Semiconductor Device Research Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Semiconductor Device Research Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422221/4422222/04422349.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power receiver design utilizing weak inversion and RF energy harvesting for demodulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4422349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low power receiver design utilizing weak inversion and RF energy harvesting for demodulation","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824957","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4422349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power receiver design utilizing weak inversion and RF energy harvesting for demodulation","confLoc":"College Park, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12302007-00127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041871S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422221","isNumber":"4422222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422221","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4422222","articleId":"4422349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4422415,"authors":[{"name":"V.

To keep weight, power consumption, data rate and costs low, the technique of switching subapertures from pulse to pulse has been proposed. While the detection performance using STAP (space-time adaptive processing) has been analysed in several publications, the estimation performance and the mechanisms leading to good or bad aperture switching strategies, have not yet been treated sufficiently. In fact, aperture partitions well suited for detection must not necessarily be good for estimation.

The speckle degrades the quality of the images and makes interpretations, analysis and classifications of SAR images harder. Therefore, some speckle reduction is necessary prior to the processing of SAR images. The speckle noise can be modeled as multiplicative i.i.d. Rayleigh noise. The discrete curvelet transform is a new image representation approach that codes image edges more efficiently than the wavelet transform. On the other hand, wavelet transform codes homogeneous areas better than curvelet transform. In this paper, two combinations of time invariant wavelet and curvelet transforms will be used for denoising of SAR images. Both of the methods use the wavelet transform to denoise homogeneous areas and the curvelet transform to denoise areas with edges. The segmentation between homogeneous areas and areas with edges is done by using total variation segmentation. Simulation results suggested that these denoised schemas can achieve good and clean images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4422841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4422841/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890163","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Combined wavelet and curvelet denoising of SAR images using TV segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined wavelet and curvelet denoising of SAR images using TV segmentation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045163S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4422841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4422847,"authors":[{"name":"Federica Meglio","affiliation":["DAEIMI-Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Federica","lastName":"Meglio","id":"37654591400"},{"name":"Gaetano Panariello","affiliation":["DAEIMI-Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Gaetano","lastName":"Panariello","id":"37348932400"},{"name":"Gilda Schirinzi","affiliation":["DAEIMI-Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Gilda","lastName":"Schirinzi","id":"37284811000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1211-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1212-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4422847","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"abstract":"Multiple SAR signals acquired along different orbits can be exploited for reconstructing a three dimensional (3-D) reflectivity profile of the scene along azimuth, range and elevation co-ordinates. For the 3-D image formation, the problem of the non-uniform spacing of the orbits has to be considered. In this paper we propose a technique based on two steps: 1) a preprocessing step, in which the samples of the multi-pass signal is computed on a grid which is uniform in the elevation direction, starting from its unevenly spaced samples; 2) a 3-D image focusing based on a simple 3-D convolution operator.

This is a consequence of the inherent homodyne configuration of the radar front-end. A simple way to reduce further the data rate is to use few bits per sample. The paper analyzes the effects of low bit sampling in FMCW Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A low number of bits used to sample the FMCW deramped signal could produces spurious peaks and intermodulation products of the sinusoidal signal. However, it is shown in the paper that, for typical value of signal to noise ratio in FMCW systems, white noise suppresses the spurious products.

A noise-shaping process increases the sparsity of the redundant transform-coefficient set, resulting in a high degree of regional coherency within the coefficient subbands. This coherency, as well as correlation across subbands, is exploited by a coding algorithm that performs set-partitioning using k-d trees. Prior experiments have shown that the proposed set-partitioning algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art JPEG2000 when coding video. However, experimental results indicate that the same coder fails to show similar gains when coding hyperspectral data, suggesting that hyperspectral data does not have properties that can be exploited by the increased directionality of the dual-tree transform.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4422977","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04422977.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4422977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral image compression with the 3D dual-tree wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4422977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral image compression with the 3D dual-tree wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4422977/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890923","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4422977/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral image compression with the 3D dual-tree wavelet transform","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046737S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4422977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4423009,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Of the many theoretical / computational approaches to dimensionality reduction, we discuss the local intrinsic dimensionality derived from the ISOMAP manifold approach. The ISOMAP algorithm itself provides one measure of global dimensionality, the eigenvalue spectrum. However, other estimation techniques are more easily adapted to determine the local dimensionality; chief among these are methods that measure minimum spanning path lengths for subsets of the full image. While intrinsic dimensionality is inherently scene dependent, knowledge of the information content, and underlying dimensionality, can guide data analysis methods and suggest appropriate data compression limits.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423103.pdf","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1542","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local intrinsic dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery from non-linear manifold coordinates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Local intrinsic dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery from non-linear manifold coordinates","htmlLink":"/document/4423103/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9890516","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local intrinsic dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery from non-linear manifold coordinates","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048859S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4423105,"authors":[{"name":"Charles M.

The approach is based on the extraction of a reduced dimensionality representation in manifold coordinates of a sufficiently large representative set of hyperspectral imagery [4]. The manifold coordinates are derived from a scalable version [4] of the isometric mapping (ISOMAP) algorithm [12] [11]. In the present work and in [5], these coordinates are used to establish an interpolating look-up table for bathymet- ric retrieval by associating the representative data with ground truth data, in this case from a LIDAR estimate in the representative area. The compression of look-up tables could also readily be applied to look-up tables generated by forward radiative transfer models [9]. In this paper, we analyze the approach using data acquired by the PHILLS [6] hyperspectral camera over the Indian River lagoon Florida in 2004. Within a few months of the PHILLS overflights, SHOALS LIDAR data was obtained for a portion of this lagoon, principally covering the beach zone and in some in stances portions of contiguous river channels.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","startPage":"1548","endPage":"1551","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423105.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bathymetric retrieval from manifold coordinate representations of hyperspectral imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4423105/","displayDocTitle":"Bathymetric retrieval from manifold coordinate representations of hyperspectral imagery","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890457","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bathymetric retrieval from manifold coordinate representations of hyperspectral imagery","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070386S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4423106,"authors":[{"name":"Jinn-Min Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jinn-Min Yang","id":"37087161823"},{"name":"Pao-Ta Yu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Educational Measurement and Statistics, National Taichung University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pao-Ta Yu","id":"37087284322"},{"name":"Bor-Chen Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Chen Kuo","id":"37087159889"},{"name":"Hsiao-Yun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Information Science, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsiao-Yun Huang","id":"37087732971"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1211-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1212-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4423106","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Hyperspectral imaging","Scattering","Matrix decomposition","Computer science","Data engineering","Vectors","Data mining","Statistics","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","S-matrix theory","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric weighted feature extraction","hyperspectral image classification","training samples","vector projection magnitude","scatter matrix","nonparametric discriminant analysis","Washington DC Mall data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feature extraction","hyperspectral data classification","small sample size"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423106","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423106.pdf","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel non-parametric weighted feature extraction method for classification of hyperspectral image with limited training samples","abstract":"In this paper, a novel non-parametric weighted linear feature extraction method has been developed for classifying hyperspectral image data with limited training samples.

Moreover, the accuracy of SSI estimation for cloudy condition is substantially lower than for clear sky. This study aims to generate a neural network based cloud factor retrieval system, which can improve accuracy of SSI estimation for cloudy condition. In this study, multilayer feed-forward (MLF) neural network (NN) was employed with Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation (LM-BP) and early stopping method to avoid the over-fitting. The number of hidden nodes was determined by using trial and error method since too complicated network was apt to be over-fitting, while a too simple network structure will have difficult training the network The validation of the estimated SSI using NN-based cloud factor was performed with pyranometer measurement data obtained from 22 meteorological stations over Korea peninsula. This SSI estimation for cloudy condition showed a good agreement with ground-based measurements (RMSE = 66.0 W/m). This accuracy indicates that the use of NN-based cloud factor leads an improvement for SSI estimation in comparison with use of previous system of cloud factor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423142/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423142/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890304","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"A improvement for the surface solar insolation retrieval from geostationary sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A improvement for the surface solar insolation retrieval from geostationary sensor","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044952S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4423143,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Five criterions, namely Mean Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Relative Error (MRE) and correlation coefficient (R2) were utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing the retrieved and the observed air temperature quantitatively. Systematic analyses suggested that the satisfied retrieval of daily mean and maximum near-surface air temperature can be achieved with MRE of 3.02% and 2.23% and RMSE of 0.93\u25a1 and 0.9\u25a1 respectively.

Under this framework, the traditional image restoration approach is extended by incorporating underwater optical properties into the system response function, specifically the point spread function (PSF) in spatial domain and modulation transfer function (MTF) in frequency domain. Due to the intensity variations involved in underwater sensing, denoising is carefully carried out by wavelet decompositions. This is necessary to explore different effects of restoration constrains, and especially their response to underwater environment where the effects of scattering can be easily treated as either signal or noise. The images are then restored using measured or modeled PSFs. An objective image quality metric, tuned with environmental optical properties, is designed to gauge the effectiveness of the restoration, and serves to check the optimization approach. This metric utilizes previous wavelet decompositions to constrain the sharpness metric based on grayscale slopes at the edge, weighted by the ratio of the power of high frequency components of the image to the total power of the image. Modeled PSFs, based on Wells' small angle approximations, are compared to those derived from Monte Carlo simulation using measured scattering properties. Initial results are presented, including estimation of water optical properties from the imagery-derived MTFs, and optimization outputs applying automated restoration framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated underwater image restoration and retrieval of related optical properties","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423193","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423193.pdf","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Automated underwater image restoration and retrieval of related optical properties","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423193/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890099","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated underwater image restoration and retrieval of related optical properties","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076801S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4423200,"authors":[{"name":"Li Liwei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, IRSA CAS, Beijing, China","Graduate School, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Liwei","id":"37087518550"},{"name":"Ma Jianwen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, IRSA CAS, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ma Jianwen","id":"37087170302"},{"name":"Chen Xue","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, IRSA CAS, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chen Xue","id":"37087389407"},{"name":"Wen Qi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, IRSA CAS, Beijing, China","Graduate School, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wen Qi","id":"37087521001"},{"name":"Xi Xiaoyan","affiliation":["School of Remote Sensing Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Xi Xiaoyan","id":"37087518027"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1211-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1212-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4423200","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Remote sensing","Image segmentation","Neural networks","Neurons","Computational efficiency","Pixel","Digital images","Joining processes","Earth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","image segmentation","neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high spatial resolution remote sensing","temporal independent pulse-coupled neural network","digital image segmentation","computational cost","spatial characteristics","spectral characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Temporal-Independent","Pulse-Coupled","Neuron Network","Segmentation","High spatial resolution remote sensing image"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423200","abstract":"Temporal Independent Pulse-Coupled Neuron Network (TI-PCNN) has been developed and shows its usefulness on digital image segmentation.

Trajectory nonlinearities have another consequence: The image focusing depends on the terrain elevation, hence motion compensation for irregular trajectories on mountainous areas must take into account terrain elevation data. Bistatic SAR processing is elevation-dependent even if the trajectory are perfectly linear (with the exception of the case where both aircrafts follow the same flight line). Terrain elevation can only be ignored at distance very large with respect to the elevation fluctuations, which is only the case in airborne bistatic SAR imaging when the area flown over is extremely flat. We describe here how the monostatic elevation-dependent motion compensation for omega-k algorithm is adapted to bistatic omega-k synthesis algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423259.pdf","startPage":"2148","endPage":"2151","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elevation-dependent motion compensation for frequency-domain bistatic SAR image synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Image generation","Radar imaging","Frequency domain analysis","Synthetic aperture radar","Bandwidth","Optical propagation","Frequency synthesizers","Airborne radar","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","geophysical techniques","motion compensation","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","topography (Earth)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elevation-dependent motion compensation","frequency-domain SAR image synthesis","bistatic SAR image synthesis","airborne trajectories","trajectory nonlinearities","image focusing","terrain elevation","omega-k algorithm","bistatic omega-k synthesis algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR image synthesis","multistatic radar","motion-compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Elevation-dependent motion compensation for frequency-domain bistatic SAR image synthesis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890848","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevation-dependent motion compensation for frequency-domain bistatic SAR image synthesis","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054611S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4423284,"authors":[{"name":"Gregoire Mercier","affiliation":["GET / ENST Bretagne / dpt.

The model is based on the copula theory for characterizing the dependency between polarimetric channels (HH, VV, HV/VH or the target vector components). The benefit in using copula theory is to extend correlation concept to a wider dependence one, which may not be linear. From this point of view, the model is more flexible than the classical Wishart distribution. But it may include it. The other benefit in using the copula model is to separate the dependence concept from the shape of the marginal pdfs. Hence, this multidimensional characterization may be linked to classical 1D gamma pdf, or to a more flexible Pearson system of distributions. In the case of high resolution data, pdf shapes are becoming of heavy tailed and the Fisher system of distributions seems to be an interesting alternative for such a model. Any parametric 1D model may be used. The paper mainly focuses on the model itself and more precisely on the technique required to construct such multidimensional dependence function. The difficulties arise for copula on 3D in which the dependency is not homogeneous between the components (the link between HH and VV may not be of the same behavior as the one between HH and HV). Illustrations are given on classification and despeckling. Classification will be performed by a stochastic estimation maximisation (SEM). Despeckling will be achieved by a maximum A posteriori technique.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423284","startPage":"2236","endPage":"2239","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423284.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of multidimensional copulas to describe amplitude distribution of polarimetric SAR data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"The use of multidimensional copulas to describe amplitude distribution of polarimetric SAR data","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423284/","accessionNumber":"9890125","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423284/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of multidimensional copulas to describe amplitude distribution of polarimetric SAR data","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073856S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4423294,"authors":[{"name":"Frederick W.

Additional information such as cloud cover and air temperature were added to the process to reduce misidentified snowfall pixels. Two products retrieved from AMSU brightness temperatures were used to estimate surface temperature and to map the snow cover extent. In this project, a neural-network-based model has been developed and has shown a great potential in detecting and estimating the intensity of snowfall events. This algorithm has been applied for different snow storms occurred between 2002 and 2003 in three different locations in the North-East of United States. These locations were selected because of the high amount of snowfall every year. Only pixels with cloud cover and falling within a specific range of temperature are presented to the snowfall detection model. Surface temperature collected from ground station-based observations archived by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) were used for this test. Different heavy storm events and non-snowfall observations that occurred at the same time as AMSU acquisition were selected. Hourly snow accumulation data collected by the NCDC were used as truth data to train and validate the model. To reduce the risk of erroneous identification of snowfall pixels, only storms lasting more than three hours were selected. Such criteria will undoubtedly increase the level of confidence that snowfall coincides with AMSU acquisition time. The neural network based snowfall product was compared with the snowfall detection algorithm over land developed in 2003 by Kongoli et al [1]. The preliminary results indicate that the neural-network-based model provides a significant improvement in snowfall detection accuracy over existing satellite-based methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423295/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9890647","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423295/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural netwotk based approach for multi-spectral snowfall detection and estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural netwotk based approach for multi-spectral snowfall detection and estimation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043017S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4423320,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Pacifici","affiliation":["Earth Observation Laboratory, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pacifici","id":"37312017600"},{"name":"Fabio Del Frate","affiliation":["Earth Observation Laboratory, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Del Frate","id":"37269662900"},{"name":"Chiara Solimini","affiliation":["Earth Observation Laboratory, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Solimini","id":"37269665900"},{"name":"William J.

At the same time, very high spatial resolution imagery presents a new challenge over other satellite systems, in that a relatively large amount of data must be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors to identify the land cover changes, commonly resulting in a very extensive manual work. To improve on this situation we have developed a new method for land surface change detection that greatly reduces the human effort needed to remove the errors that occur with many methods applied to very high spatial resolution imagery. This change detection algorithm is based on Neural Networks and it is able to exploit in parallel both the multi-band and the multi-temporal data to discriminate between real changes and false alarms. In general the classification errors are reduced by a factor of 2\u20133 using this new method over a simple Post Classification Comparison based on a neural network classification of the same images.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423320","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2381","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing

An evaluation of FARSITE and FlamMap bushfire spread models developed by the Fire Sciences Laboratory at Missoula involved a comparison of fire simulator models over two Californian landscapes representing different terrain and vegetation regimes. The paper includes a discussion on the models, the assumptions and limitations resulting from their application, and also the assembly of data to build landscape files and model outputs over the two test areas. The spatial datasets used in this study are sourced from the USGS EROS Data Center's LANDFIRE database at 30-metre pixel resolution. Information about fuel which has been derived from satellite imagery, terrain modelling and biophysical and local field knowledge was used to build Anderson's 13 Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM13) and Scott and Burgan's 40 Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM40). These were ingested into the FARSITE fire growth simulation model and FlamMap fire potential simulator. The FBFM40 provides a better representation of fuel across the landscape, leading to an improvement in surface fire intensity prediction and increased precision in determining crown fire behaviour. The FARSITE/FlamMap were used to model fire behaviour, and WindWizard simulated wind speed and direction scenarios across the Woodacre and Glen Ellen regions near San Francisco, California. FARSITE and FlamMap are two separate fire simulation models that use the same input datasets (vegetation/ground cover type, crown stand height, crown base height, crown bulk density, temperature, humidity, precipitation, slope, aspect, elevation, wind speed and direction). In this study, the actual fire perimeters were not available to compare the overestimated and underestimated fire growth perimeters/areas after and before using gridded wind data into the fire simulation. However, previous studies demonstrate that incorporation of gridded wind data clearly improves prediction of fire growth perimeters. The preliminary evaluation of FARSITE/FlamMap simulations appropriately predicts fire growth process and assesses resources at risk, suggesting the need for further experiments in areas of different terrain and vegetation, and with varied weather conditions. In future research, it is proposed to evaluate how these models compare with existing Australian fire models by using the example of recent Australian wildfire events.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423478","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423478.pdf","startPage":"3008","endPage":"3013","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying fire spread simulation over two study sites in California lessons learned and future plans","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Applying fire spread simulation over two study sites in California lessons learned and future plans","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4423478/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890189","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423478/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying fire spread simulation over two study sites in California lessons learned and future plans","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077133S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4423527,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In particular, we consider two strategies based on data fusion methods applied to the outputs of the optical heads of the hyperspectral sensor. Furthermore, we consider, two computationally efficient implementations of anomaly detection where the well known RX algorithm is applied to hyperspectral data after dimensionality reduction. The detection performances of the anomaly detection strategies are compared using real data acquired by the MIVIS sensor. An estimate of the reduction of the computational load achieved with the different techniques is also provided.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423527","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International

The spatio-temporal features of infrared (IR) radiation from loaded rock, stick-sliding rock and simulated active fault motion based on experimental IR detection are also introduced. Especially, the experiments on simulated fault activity shows that the TIR anomaly is likely to develop along the primary fault and the both sides of wedge-shaped acute geo-block in condition of intersected fault system, and that the intersection location is usually the coming epicenter. The theoretical mechanism of TIR anomaly before tectonic earthquake is hence suggested to be stress-thermal effect accompanied and strengthened by hydro-geological effect, greenhouse effect, P-hole effect and so on. As a case, the spatio-temporal features of TIR before Zhangbei Ms6.2 1998 earthquake is theoretically analyzed based on the overlay of active fault system on NOAA-AVHHR satellite TIR images. It was discovered that TIR anomaly is controlled by a potential great deep active fault and that the epicenter is exactly the intersection point of the primary great fault and two secondary faults being tow sides of an acute wedge-shaped active geo-block. It is concluded that although the earthquake is a complex and uncertain process of crust motion, the predication of earthquake is not impossible. Referring to the developing GEOSS and generalized remote sensing (GRS), a preliminary procedure for comprehensive multiple parameters analysis on fault activities and earthquake early warning is presented, which is based on massive data fusion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423652.pdf","startPage":"3723","endPage":"3727","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis to impending tectonic earthquake warning based on satellite infrared anomaly","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earthquakes","Satellites","Infrared detectors","Ocean temperature","Remote sensing","Electric shock","Infrared imaging","Global Positioning System","Geographic Information Systems","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Earth crust","earthquakes","faulting","infrared imaging","remote sensing","seismology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tectonic earthquake warning","satellite infrared anomaly","spatiotemporal features","infrared radiation","loaded rock","stick-sliding rock","active fault motion","fault activity","wedge-shaped acute geoblock","fault intersection","stress-thermal effect","hydrogeological effect","greenhouse effect","P-hole effect","Zhangbei earthquake","China","AD 1998","theoretical analysis","active fault system","NOAA-AVHHR satellite TIR images","crust motion","GEOSS","remote sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tectonic earthquake","satellite infrared anomaly","mechanism interpretation","tectonic activity","simulation experiment","early warnin","GEOSS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis to impending tectonic earthquake warning based on satellite infrared anomaly","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423652/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890104","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis to impending tectonic earthquake warning based on satellite infrared anomaly","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093119S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4423666,"authors":[{"name":"Are C.

In hyperspectral images the number of bands can be in the hundreds leading to covariance matrices having tens of thousands of elements. Lately, the use of general linear regression models in estimating the inverse covariance matrix have been introduced in the time-series literature. This paper adopts and expands these ideas to ill-posed hyperspectral image classification problems. The results indicate that at least some of the approaches can give a lower classification error than traditional methods such as the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the regularized discriminant analysis (RDA). Furthermore, the results show that contrary to earlier beliefs, long-range correlation coefficients appear necessary to build an effective hyperspectral classifier, and that the high correlations between neighboring bands seem to allow differing sparsity configurations of the covariance matrix to obtain similar classification results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4423666/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9872674","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Regression approaches to small sample inverse covariance matrix estimation for hyperspectral image classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression approaches to small sample inverse covariance matrix estimation for hyperspectral image classification","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033162S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4423673,"authors":[{"name":"Janete S.

This paper gives an overview of the latest upgrading to acquire large data set without on board deramp-on-receive mode and then present the acquisition campaign at X band for very high resolution single pass interferometric multi-baseline mode. The multi- baseline mode used is a ping-pong mode where four antennas are used.

The method is based on the assumption that due to the resolution of the image, most pixels are mixtures of pure substances, which are relatively rare in the scenes. In the first stage of the algorithm, the background classes, which are the dominant classes in the image, are found. The method consists of robust clustering of a randomly-chosen small percentage of the image pixels. The resulting clusters may be considered as representatives of the background classes in the image. In order to determine the anomalous pixels, a threshold may be applied to the distance between the pixel spectrum and the cluster centres. However, pixels corresponding to anomalies and pure substances will both show high distances. If we consider that the background classes are themselves most likely mixtures of other materials, the pixels within the convex hull formed by the background classes will have positive fractions that are smaller than 1. The pure substances, however, will be outside such a convex hull, and will show negative or superunity fractions. We propose to use the unmixing spectral linear model without the non-negativity constraint, to distinguish between false anomalies corresponding to pure substances and real man-made anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423733","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423733.pdf","startPage":"4029","endPage":"4032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection using spectral unmixing with negative and superunity abundance weights","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423733/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection using spectral unmixing with negative and superunity abundance weights","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9891168","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423733/","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection using spectral unmixing with negative and superunity abundance weights","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048183S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4423734,"authors":[{"name":"Jose M.

This method decomposes a hyperspectral images into a collection of reflectance (or radiance) spectra of the materials present in the scene (end member signatures) and the corresponding abundance fractions at each pixel. DECA assumes that each pixel is a linear mixture of the end-members signatures weighted by the correspondent abundance fractions. These abundances are modeled as mixtures of Dirichlet densities, thus enforcing the constraints on abundance fractions imposed by the acquisition process, namely non-negativity and constant sum. The mixing matrix is inferred by a generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) type algorithm. This method overcomes the limitations of unmixing methods based on independent component analysis (ICA) and on geometrical based approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using simulated data based on U.S.G.S. laboratory spectra and real hyperspectral data collected by the AVIRIS sensor over Cuprite, Nevada.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423734","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423734.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","startPage":"4033","endPage":"4036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral unmixing algorithm via dependent component analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral unmixing algorithm via dependent component analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423734/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890105","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4423734/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral unmixing algorithm via dependent component analysis","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093665S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4423735,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Plaza","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Plaza","id":"37299997700"},{"name":"Antonio Plaza","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Plaza","id":"37299689800"},{"name":"Rosa Perez","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Rosa","lastName":"Perez","id":"37285700300"},{"name":"Pablo Martinez","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37285392900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1211-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1212-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4423735","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423735","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Optical imaging","Spectroscopy","Image analysis","Spectral analysis","Pixel","Coupled mode analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Multi-layer neural network","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","image processing","neural nets","remote sensing","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral unmixing","hyperspectral image data","spectral mixture analysis","linear mixing model","multilayer neural network","border training algorithm","mixed signature algorithm","mophological erosion algorithm","digital airborne imaging spectrometers","DAIS 7915","reflective optics system imaging spectrometers","ROSIS","DLR"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423735","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423735.pdf","startPage":"4037","endPage":"4040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint linear/nonlinear spectral unmixing of hyperspectral image data","abstract":"Many available techniques for spectral mixture analysis involve the separation of mixed pixel spectra collected by imaging spectrometers into pure component (endmember) spectra, and the estimation of abundance values for each end- member. Although linear mixing models generally provide a good abstraction of the mixing process, several naturally occurring situations exist where nonlinear models may provide the most accurate assessment of endmember abundance. In this paper, we propose a combined linear/nonlinear mixture model which makes use of linear mixture analysis to provide an initial model estimation, which is then thoroughly refined using a multi-layer neural network coupled with intelligent algorithms for automatic selection of training samples. Three different algorithms for automatic selection of training samples, such as border training algorithm (BTA), mixed signature algorithm (MSA) and mophological erosion algorithm (MEA) are developed for this purpose. The proposed model is evaluated in the context of a real application which involves the use of hyperspectral data sets, collected by the Digital Airborne (DAIS 7915) and Reflective Optics System (ROSIS) imaging spectrometers of DLR, operating simultaneously at multiple spatial resolutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423735/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9891158","publicationDate":"July 2007","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423735/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint linear/nonlinear spectral unmixing of hyperspectral image data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint linear/nonlinear spectral unmixing of hyperspectral image data","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041404S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4423739,"authors":[{"name":"John E.

BBA uses the spectral information divergence (SID) to reduce each pixel's high dimensional data to a scalar value, where the Bhattacharyya distance (BD) is maximized. The initial segmentation is based on feature vectors created from the SID metric. The level set segmentation then enhances areas that do not have spatially homogeneous ground cover. The proposed method is tested on a 72-band compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) image of a farm area in northern Mississippi, U.S.A. The proposed method is compared to a BBA-based maximum-likelihood (ML) method. Quantitative results are compared using segmentation and classification accuracies. Results show that both the initial classification using BBA features and the level set enhancement produced high-quality ground cover maps and outperformed the ML method, as well as previous studies by the authors.

The aim was to detect a detailed \"from-to\" change information; it targets a quantitative estimation of the extent and the magnitude of the changes affecting major identified species of the Moroccan cedar ecosystem: cedar, oak, and deciduous. The major challenge was to identify changes of interest such as identifying the change due to a selective logging which consists on cutting cedar canopy trees while sparing the understory oak trees. To address these issues and achieve our objectives, we adopted a methodology with two main stages. First, we mapped major forest species from multidate satellite images (Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)) using maximum likelihood classification (MLQ and spectral mixture analysis (SMA). Second, we performed change detection assessment using two procedures: (i) image products differencing to assess the overall change in the forest cover, (ii) post-classification comparisons using the outputs of the MLC and the relative abundances of forest species as determined by SMA. Results have shown the following: logging has decreased cedar area in a proportion of 12% while reforestation has yielded an increase of 8% in cedar forest; in oak forest, the increment (21%) has exceeded the deforestation effect (17%); conversely, deciduous have either degraded (11%) or remained stable (21%).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deforestation Detection and Monitoring in Cedar Forests of the Moroccan Middle-Atlas Mountains","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423809","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423809.pdf","startPage":"4327","endPage":"4330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Deforestation Detection and Monitoring in Cedar Forests of the Moroccan Middle-Atlas Mountains","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423809/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9902267","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deforestation Detection and Monitoring in Cedar Forests of the Moroccan Middle-Atlas Mountains","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050825S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4423818,"authors":[{"name":"Yakoub Bazi","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Al Jouf University, Al Jouf, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Yakoub","lastName":"Bazi","id":"38480650300"},{"name":"Farid Melgani","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Melgani","id":"37274823900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1211-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1212-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4423818","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Parameter estimation","Particle swarm optimization","Remote sensing","Educational institutions","Communications technology","Image analysis","Costs","Stability","Position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","image processing","oceanographic techniques","particle swarm optimisation","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective particle swarm optimization","MOPSO approach","SVM regression","limited training samples","remote sensing images","SVM estimator","support vector machine","chlorophyll concentration","subsurface waters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biophysical parameter estimation","data inflation","multiobjective particle swarm optimizer (PSO)","semi-supervised regression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423818","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423818.pdf","startPage":"4360","endPage":"4363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiobjective PSO inflation methodology for SVM regression with limited training samples","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach for SVM regression with limited training samples.

The soil emissivity spectra from the ASTER spectral library have been used to produce the training dataset, and the soil emissivity spectra from the MODIS spectral library have been used to produce the test dataset, the result of network test shows the MLP is robust. Meanwhile, ISSTES algorithm has also been used to retrieve the temperature and emissivity from the test dataset. By Comparison the result of MLP and ISSTES, we find MLP can overcome the disadvantage of conventional temperature and emissivity separation algorithms, although the RMSE of derived emissivity using MLP is lower than ISSTES as a whole.

temperature (LST) from passive microwave remote sensing because a single multi-frequency thermal measurement with N bands owns n equations in N+1unknowns (N emissivities and LST) which is a typical ill-posed inversion problem. However, the emissivity is mainly influenced by dielectric constant which is a function of physical temperature, salinity, water content, soil texture, and other factors (the structure and types of vegetation). These make it very difficult to develop a general physical algorithm. This paper intends to utilize the multiple- sensor/resolution and neural network to retrieve land surface temperature from AMSR-E data. MODIS LST product is made as ground data which overcomes the difficulty of obtaining large scale land surface temperature data. The retrieval result and analysis indicate that the neural network can be used to accurately retrieve land surface temperature from AMSR-E data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information retrieval","Land surface","Land surface temperature","Microwave theory and techniques","Temperature sensors","Neural networks","Passive microwave remote sensing","Dielectric measurements","Microwave measurements","Soil measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","land surface temperature","microwave measurement","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network technique","land surface temperature retrieval","AMSR-E passive microwave data","passive microwave remote sensing","single multifrequency thermal measurement","inversion problem","dielectric constant","physical temperature","salinity","water content","soil texture","vegetation","multiple-sensor data","multiple-resolution data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LST","NN","AMSR-E","MODIS"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423835","startPage":"4422","endPage":"4425","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423835.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-network technique for retrieving land surface temperature from AMSR-E passive microwave data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural-network technique for retrieving land surface temperature from AMSR-E passive microwave data","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9902196","publicationDate":"July 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4423835/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural-network technique for retrieving land surface temperature from AMSR-E passive microwave data","confLoc":"Barcelona","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113803S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4423940,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The goal is to extend the algorithm proposed in [1], and successfully applied to MODIS data from band 21, to the case of multiband investigation. A multiple-channel model has been designed, where data from MODIS bands 21 and 31 are projected into a new coordinates system by adopting the principal component analysis (PCA). A preliminary statistical analysis has been performed on both the principal components of data to verify that the Weibull distribution can be adopted for background. Subsequently, a Kendall test has been used to check the level of dependency of the projected data and it has shown that channels independence can be assumed with high significance level. After PCA, a CFAR detection is applied to projected data and thanks to data independence the single detections are combined with an AND rule. The outcome of the AND operation gives the thermal anomalies detected in both channels with an assigned overall probability of false alarm (PFA). The Multiband CFAR algorithm has been applied to a 256 x 256 MODIS image from bands 21 and 31 and results have been compared with those from NASA-DAAC MOD14.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423940","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423940.pdf","startPage":"4822","endPage":"4825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiband CFAR detection of thermal anomalies using principal component analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423940/","displayDocTitle":"Multiband CFAR detection of thermal anomalies using principal component analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890473","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423940/","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiband CFAR detection of thermal anomalies using principal component analysis","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042057S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4423942,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser M.

To enable repeat-pass interferometry a high-precision navigation system is needed. Due to the limit of accuracy of such systems, deviations in the order of centimeters remain between the nominal and the processed reference track causing mainly undesirable phase undulations and misregistration in the interferograms, referred as residual motion errors. Up to now only interferometric approaches, as multi-squint, are used to estimate those deviations to compensate for such residuals. In this paper we present for the first time the use of the Autofocus technique for residual motion errors. A very robust autofocus technique has to be used since the accuracy of the estimated motion has to be at millimeter scale. Because we deal with low-altitude-strip- map mode data we propose a new robust autofocus technique based on the WLS (Weighted Least-Squares) phase estimation and Phase Curvature Autofocus (PCA) extended to the range- dependent case. We call this new technique WPCA (Weighted PCA). While the multi-squint approach is only able to estimate the baseline variation from coregistered images, the autofocus approach has the advantage of being able to estimate motion deviations independently for each image. Repeat-pass data of the E-SAR system of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An autofocus approach for residual motion errors with application to airborne repeat-pass SAR interferometry","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423956","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423956.pdf","startPage":"4886","endPage":"4889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"An autofocus approach for residual motion errors with application to airborne repeat-pass SAR interferometry","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4423956/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890475","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An autofocus approach for residual motion errors with application to airborne repeat-pass SAR interferometry","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078937S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4423961,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Shibata","affiliation":["JAXA, Earth Observation Research and Application Center, Tsukuba, Japan"],"lastName":"Akira Shibata","id":"37269738800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1211-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1212-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4423961","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ocean temperature","Wind","Contamination","Microwave radiometry","Spatial resolution","Sea surface","Earth Observing System","Aircraft manufacture","Polarization","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ocean temperature","oceanographic techniques","radiometers","remote sensing","sea ice"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positive SST anomalies","high-latitude oceans","northern hemisphere","AMSR-E","sea surface temperature","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer","Earth Observing System","AQUA","Arctic sea ice distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AMSR-E","microwave","SST","high-latitudes","pssitive anomaly"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positive SST anomalies in high-latitude oceans of the northern hemisphere as observed by AMSR-E","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","endPage":"4907","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423961.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423961","startPage":"4906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423961","abstract":"Sea surface temperature (SST) observed by the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) aboard the AQUA, whose data are available from July 2002 to the present, was used to detect SST anomalies in the northern high latitudes oceans.

It has turned out to be a promising alternative technology for low dielectric contrast objects, a difficult detection situation that is often encountered in practise (e.g. detection of plastic mines in dry or sandy soils environment). This paper examines numerically the imaging of buried objects using ultrawide-band (UWB) time domain radar. We develop a simplified model to characterize the system, air-ground-buried targets-antennas and simulate the electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering at a bandwidth of 0.5-2.5 Ghz. All the elements need to be modelled simultaneously in order to obtain an accurate estimation of our radar performance and surface response to the incoming radar pulses. The final goal is to improve the detection rate of plastic antipersonnel mines, reducing the false alarm level. We show some simulated results in 2D and 3D assuming plane waves and afterwards we introduce a model for our GPR antennas to characterize the real source.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423974","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","startPage":"4957","endPage":"4960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical simulation of electromagnetic-wave propagation for land mine detection using GPR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical simulation of electromagnetic-wave propagation for land mine detection using GPR","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423974/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890472","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4423974/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical simulation of electromagnetic-wave propagation for land mine detection using GPR","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063639S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4423994,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Nannini","affiliation":["German Aerospace Centre-DLR, Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Nannini","id":"37391752700"},{"name":"Rolf Scheiber","affiliation":["German Aerospace Centre-DLR, Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Scheiber","id":"37327988200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1211-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1212-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4423994","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Tomography","Focusing","Synthetic aperture radar","Image resolution","Target tracking","Azimuth","Microwave theory and techniques","Airborne radar","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","image registration","motion compensation","radar imaging","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["height dependent motion compensation","image coregistration","airborne SAR tomography","SAR imaging","multiple phase center separation","2D SAR repeat-pass processing","volumetric target","processing correction","tomogram quality","data acquisition","E-SAR system","German Aerospace Centre"]}],"abstract":"SAR tomography (SARTom) is an imaging technique that allows multiple phase centers separation in the vertical (height) direction. It is performed after standard 2D SAR repeat-pass processing and operates on a stack of coregistered SAR images. Theoretically, the coregistration between two images is height dependent and the use of a reference height (or a DEM) is needed, although not ideal in the case of volumetric target (multiple phase centers in one resolution cell). In this paper, the drawbacks related to the choice of this reference in a tomographic context are analysed and a height dependent coregistration approach is proposed. In order to do this, it is also necessary to remove processing corrections related to the reference height, such as motion compensation, and make them height dependent. The inclusion of the height dependency during the tomographic SAR processing results in a better quality of the final tomograms in terms of pseudo-power and phase centers separation. The results of the proposed approach are validated on real data acquired by the E-SAR system of the German Aerospace Centre - DLR.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423994","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04423994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","startPage":"5041","endPage":"5044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Height dependent motion compensation and coregistration for airborne SAR tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4423994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Height dependent motion compensation and coregistration for airborne SAR tomography","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4423994/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9891012","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4423994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Height dependent motion compensation and coregistration for airborne SAR tomography","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036044S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4423994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424027,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The Chirp Scaling Algorithm (CSA) is one of the most important and well-known radar imaging algorithms. It is attractive because of its excellent focusing ability and implementation simplicity. Benefiting from the inherent structure of the FrFT for non- stationary digital signal processing and analysis, especially for chirped-type signals, a new version of the CSA based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) is developed. The introduced Fractional Chirp Scaling Algorithm (FrCSA) applied the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) instead of the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) in the azimuth direction for the analytical development tractability purposes only as it numerically tractable in both dimensions. To demonstrate the resolution and focusing enhancement in the azimuth dimension using the FrCSA and also to be able to perform azimuth fractional filtering, noise removal and flight path nonlinearity compensation, a closed form expression for the azimuth fractional transformation is required. In this talk we present the mathematical derivation for a closed- form expression of the azimuth-fractional Fourier transform of the new FrCSA with application to high resolution imaging. Results to real SAR data images will show significantly enhanced features using the FrFT-based azimuth expression instead of the classical FFT-based one within the fractional chirp scaling algorithm or any other chirped-type SAR imaging algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4424027","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04424027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4424027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","startPage":"5174","endPage":"5177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fractional Fourier transform and its application to high resolution SAR imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The fractional Fourier transform and its application to high resolution SAR imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424027/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9890203","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4424027/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fractional Fourier transform and its application to high resolution SAR imaging","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047616S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4424027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":4424033,"authors":[{"name":"Evan C.

SAR processing assumes that the sensor is moving in a straight line at a constant speed, but in actuality a UAV or airplane will deviate, often significantly, from this ideal. This non-ideal motion can seriously degrade the SAR image quality. In a continuous wave system this motion happens during the radar pulse which means that existing motion compensation techniques, which approximate the position as constant over a pulse, are limited for an LFM-CW SAR. In this paper, the LFM-CW SAR signal model is presented and processing algorithms are discussed. The effects of non-ideal motion during the SAR signal are derived and new methods for motion correction are developed which correct for motion during the pulse. These new motion correction algorithms are verified with simulated data and with actual data collected using the BYU muSAR system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4422707/4422708/04424033.pdf","startPage":"5198","endPage":"5201","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4424033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4424033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full motion compensation for LFM-CW synthetic aperture radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Chirp modulation","Frequency modulation","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Airplanes","Degradation","Image quality","Radar imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","motion compensation","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full motion compensation","LFM-CW synthetic aperture radar","linear frequency modulated continuous wave signal","SAR signal processing","SAR image quality","motion compensation techniques","motion correction algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Full motion compensation for LFM-CW synthetic aperture radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424033/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9891195","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"23-28 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full motion compensation for LFM-CW synthetic aperture radar","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-01325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073144S","chronDate":"23-28 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4422707","isNumber":"4422708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4422707","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4422708","articleId":"4424033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4424061,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Klare","affiliation":["Forschungsgesellschaft f\u00fcr Angewandte Naturwissenschaften e.

In this way, improvements in lighting applications, which is a significant point of energy consumption, could be very much welcomed. Electronic ballast may serve to this goal since they are focused on achieving energy savings, reduction in the utility line harmonic content and reactive power, as well as on implementing dimming control and some other parameter of interest in lighting applications. On the other hand, power quality problems are very common in our power system and any new electric device should be designed taking into account these events. One of the typical problems in electrical distribution systems are voltage sags. These have a great incidence on the electrical equipment connected to the network in the same area. The sags cause more damages than the rest of disturbances because these have a greater frequency of occurrence. In this work, the effects of voltage sags on several 150-W high- pressure sodium lamps combined with two different types of electronic ballast have been studied. One of the ballasts supplies the required voltage to minimize the reactive component in the resonant inverter, while the other regulates the power supplied by the utility line to be constant in long term, the resonant inverter being also in open loop at constant switching frequency providing the short term stability. The results of these electronic ballasts will be compared with those obtained with the traditional electromagnetic ballast. The influence of the lamp age will be also considered in the approach. The final goal of this study is to improve the performance of the ballast prototypes under voltage sags.","doi":"10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424185","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424072/4424073/04424185.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of voltage sags on different types of ballasts for 150-W HPS lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effects of voltage sags on different types of ballasts for 150-W HPS lamps","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424185/","accessionNumber":"9825657","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424185/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of voltage sags on different types of ballasts for 150-W HPS lamps","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12292007-00112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052168S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424072","isNumber":"4424073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424072","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4424073","articleId":"4424185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"LPQIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424197,"authors":[{"name":"Mahda Jenabali Jahromi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Eng, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahda Jenabali","lastName":"Jahromi","id":"37603613500"},{"name":"Ebrahim Farjah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Eng, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Farjah","id":"37388821600"},{"name":"Mansour Zolghadri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Eng, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mansour","lastName":"Zolghadri","id":"37694853500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-84-690-9441-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-6647"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-6655"}],"articleNumber":"4424197","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":597},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424197","abstract":"The necessity for flexible electric systems, changing regulatory and economic scenarios, quality of power and environmental impacts are providing impetus to the development of Distributed Generation (DG), which is predicted to play an increasing role in the electric power systems of the future. With so much new DG being installed, it is essential that the effects on power systems be assessed accurately so that DG can be applied in a manner that not only avoids causing degradation of power quality; but also it enhances specific indices in that category. For these reasons, a new procedure is proposed based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA), capable to establish the optimal distributed generation allocation on a MV distribution network, considering the vulnerability of the system to voltage sag. In order to demonstrate the effect of DG allocation in a network three indices have been examined. Average RMS (Variation) Frequency Index, SARFIx; which represents the average number of specified RMS variation events that occurs over the assessment period per customer served, the Overall Sag Performance (OSP) which is the number or percentage of buses experiencing voltage sag and the Overall Voltage Drop (OVD) which is basically a summation of all voltage drops in the distribution network under study. The first index reveals the effect of the positioning, on the end users, while the other two reflect the effect on the whole network. The most appropriate places for DG installation have been found to be the weakest parts of the network. The results show that the appropriate placement of DG results in a tremendous improvement of the aforementioned indices.","doi":"10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424197","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424072/4424073/04424197.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating voltage sag by optimal allocation of Distributed Generation using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage fluctuations","Distributed control","Genetic algorithms","Power system economics","Power generation economics","Economic forecasting","Environmental economics","Power systems","Degradation","Power quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","genetic algorithms","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage sag","optimal allocation","distributed generation","genetic algorithm","RMS variation events","overall sag performance","OSP","overall voltage drop","OVD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Generation","Voltage Sag","Power Quality","Genetic Algorithm","MV Distribution Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating voltage sag by optimal allocation of Distributed Generation using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424197/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9825675","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating voltage sag by optimal allocation of Distributed Generation using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12292007-00124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0611S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424072","isNumber":"4424073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424072","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4424073","articleId":"4424197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"LPQIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4424208,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The dispatch of renewable distributed energy sources at present is performed in such a way that, when implemented at very large scale, their intermittency can impact on the grids, what leads to concerns in terms of power quality and of security of supply. The objective of this work is to analyse the benefits of a storage system in domestic PV (Photovoltaic) grid- connected installations. The paper explores how micro- storage could minimize some distribution problems for the end-user (micro cut-off, black-out) and could allow injection into the grid with dispatch strategies that combine deferred PV generation and demand-side management of domestic loads.

From an electrical engineering point of view, a new situation will arise for consumers concerning security of supply and power quality, which calls for further technical measures by the grid operators to ensure that the increasingly stringent supply criteria can be met. This article describes a new power electronics based approach which allows a grid compatible integration of predominantly renewable electricity generators even in weak grids making them appear to be electromechanical synchronous machines. As a consequence, all the proven properties of this type of machine which have so far defined the grid continue to do so, even when integrating photovoltaic or wind energy. These properties include, for instance, interaction between grid and generator as in a remote power dispatch, reaction to transients as well as the full electrical effects of a rotating mass. In addition, this new development can be operated in such a way that it provides primary reserve allowing, from a grid point of view, electricity generators such as wind and PV to be regarded as conventional power stations.","doi":"10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424220","publicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424072/4424073/04424220.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual synchronous machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Virtual synchronous machine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424220/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9825709","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424220/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual synchronous machine","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12292007-00147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029645S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424072","isNumber":"4424073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424072","citationCount":"482","xplore-issue":"4424073","articleId":"4424220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"LPQIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4424231,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The parallel evolution branches in the GA are used for the purpose of the optimization acceleration. The application of this GA has been implemented in Matlab. The evaluation part of the GA implementation is based on the steady-state analysis using a linear one-line diagram model of a power network. The results of steady-state solution are compared with the results from the DIgSILENT Power Factory program. Its practical applicability is demonstrated on examples of 22 kV radial and meshed overhead distribution networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424231/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9825726","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424231/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the compensation of a meshed MV network by a modified Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the compensation of a meshed MV network by a modified Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12292007-00158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067237S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424072","isNumber":"4424073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424072","xplore-issue":"4424073","articleId":"4424231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"LPQIIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4424245,"authors":[{"name":"Boguslaw Swiatek","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology (AGH-UST), Cracow, Poland"],"lastName":"Boguslaw Swiatek","id":"37087445688"},{"name":"Marek Rogoz","affiliation":["ENION SA Power Distribution Company, University of Science and Technology (AGH-UST), Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Rogoz","id":"37423572800"},{"name":"Zbigniew Hanzelka","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology (AGH-UST), Cracow, Poland"],"lastName":"Zbigniew Hanzelka","id":"37087166806"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-84-690-9441-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-6647"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-6655"}],"articleNumber":"4424245","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system harmonics","Neural networks","Active filters","Power harmonic filters","Power electronics","Electronics industry","Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques","Industrial pollution","Power distribution","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","neural nets","power engineering computing","power supply quality","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system harmonic estimation","neural networks","harmonics magnitude","harmonics phase","DFT method","power supply quality","discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power quality","harmonics","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424245","abstract":"The increasing application of power electronic facilities in the industrial environment has led to serious concerns about source line pollution and the resulting impacts on system equipment and power distribution systems. Consequently, active power filters (APFs) have been used as an effective way to compensate harmonic components in nonlinear loads. Obviously, fast and precise harmonic detection is one of the key factors to design APFs. Various digital signal analysis techniques are being used for the measurement and estimation of power system harmonics. Presently, neural network has received special attention from the researchers because of its simplicity, learning and generalization ability. This paper presents a neural networkbased algorithm that can identify both in magnitude and phase of harmonics. Experimental results have testified its performance with a variety of generated harmonies and interharmonics. Comparison with the conventional DFT method is also presented to demonstrate its very fast response and high accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424245","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424073","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th International Conference on Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424072/4424073/04424245.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system harmonic estimation using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424245/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power system harmonic estimation using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424245/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9825741","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system harmonic estimation using neural networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-12292007-00172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060943S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424072","isNumber":"4424073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424072","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4424073","articleId":"4424245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"LPQI","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424453,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Rohlfshagen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, UK"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Rohlfshagen","id":"37680134100"},{"name":"John A.

Our method, called implicit alternative splicing (iAS), is repeatedly applied to the individual encodings in the algorithm's population and inverts randomly chosen segments of decreasing size in a systematic fashion. Its goal is to determine the largest possible segment the inversion of which yields no loss in the encoding's quality. The application of iAS potentially produces a new encoding of equal or greater quality that is maximum possible Hamming distance from its source. This allows iAS to uphold the diversity of the population even if a minimal population size is chosen. This significantly improves the performance of an otherwise standard GA on a representative set of three different optimisation problems. Empirical results are compared and analysed and future work prospects are considered.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424453","startPage":"47","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424453.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implicit alternative splicing for genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424453/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implicit alternative splicing for genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424453/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889248","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implicit alternative splicing for genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069552S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424454,"authors":[{"name":"X.

However, most works in this area have so far ignored the effects of cost on Portfolio Optimization, and haven't directly addressed the problem of portfolio management (continuous optimization of a portfolio over time). In this work, we use the Euclidean Distance between the portfolio selection in two consecutive time periods as measure of cost, and the objective sharing method to balance the goals of maximizing returns and minimizing distance over time. We also improve the GA method by adding genetic material from previous runs into the new population (seeding). We experiment our method on historical monthly data from the NASDAQ and NIKKEI indexes, and obtain a better result than pure GA, defeating the index under non-bubble market conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424472/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889514","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424472/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modelling cost into a genetic algorithm-based portfolio optimization system by seeding and objective sharing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling cost into a genetic algorithm-based portfolio optimization system by seeding and objective sharing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057684S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4424486,"authors":[{"name":"Satoko Kikuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoko","lastName":"Kikuchi","id":"37839591400"},{"name":"Goutam Chakraborty","affiliation":["Graduate School of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, Japan"],"firstName":"Goutam","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37328979200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424486","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genomics","Bioinformatics","Genetic algorithms","Decoding","Biological cells","Humans","Assembly systems","Information science","Computational efficiency","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data analysis","genetic algorithms","genetics","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genome fragment assembling","genetic algorithm","heuristic search","shotgun sequencing","genome sequence decoding","chromosome reduction","chromosome length shortening","genetic search","chromosome refinement","greedy heuristics","domain knowledge","hybridization","scaffolds","contig restructuring"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424486","abstract":"Shotgun sequencing is the state-of-the-art to decode genome sequence.

We describe two test problems; the concatenated parity function (CPF), and the concatenated parity/trap function (CP/TF). Although these functions are separable, with bounded complexity and uniformly scaled sub-function contributions, the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) scales exponentially on both. hBOA is able to solve large CPFs with small population sizes when it is unable to solve them with larger population sizes. We argue that test problems containing parity functions are hard for EDAs because there are no interactions in the contribution to fitness between any strict subset of a parity function's bits. This means that as population sizes increase the dependency between variable values for any strict subset of a parity function's bits decreases. Unfortunately most EDAs including hBOA search for their models by looking for dependencies between pairs of variables (at least at first). We make suggestions on how EDAs could be adjusted to handle parity problems, but also comment on the apparently inevitable computational cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424494","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424494.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"369","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The limitations of distribution sampling for linkage learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"The limitations of distribution sampling for linkage learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4424494/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889553","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424494/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The limitations of distribution sampling for linkage learning","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040334S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4424503,"authors":[{"name":"Aimin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"lastName":"Aimin Zhou","id":"37087832234"},{"name":"Qingfu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"lastName":"Qingfu Zhang","id":"37087253087"},{"name":"Yaochu Jin","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH, Germany"],"lastName":"Yaochu Jin","id":"37087147071"},{"name":"Bernhard Sendhoff","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sendhoff","id":"37276617200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424503","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424503","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Couplings","Testing","Probability","Data mining","Sampling methods","Pareto optimization","Principal component analysis","Convergence","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modelling strategy","continuous multiobjective optimization","Pareto optimal set","multiobjective evolutionary algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424503","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424503.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"431","endPage":"437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive modelling strategy for continuous multi-objective optimization","abstract":"The Pareto optimal set of a continuous multiobjective optimization problem is a piecewise continuous manifold under some mild conditions.We have recently developed several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on this property.

These patterns often contain useful information that could be used to guide the EA to the optimum. While an EA is able to quickly locate the general area of a peak, it can take a considerable amount of time to refine the solution to accurately reflect its true location. We present a new technique that can be used with most EAs. A surface is fitted to the previously-found points using a least squares regression. By calculating the highest point of this surface we can guide the EA to the likely location of the optimum, vastly improving the convergence speed. This technique is tested on Moving Peaks, a commonly used dynamic test function generator.

The predictions are evaluated using fitness functions based on potential energies (electrostatic and van der Waals) and hydrophobic interactions. The proposed approach uses dihedral angles and main angles of the lateral chains to model a protein structure. ProtPred is evaluated using relatively complex cases for an Ab initio approach.

However, multi-layer feedforward neural network (MFNN) with wide applications has some disadvantages such as local minimal points on the error surface and over-fitting problem. At the same time, the conventional approaches usually fixing the number of hidden nodes and focusing on the input selection hinder further remove of the redundant information and improvement of network generalization performance. To solve these problems, a feature selection algorithm using double parallel feedforward neural network (DPFNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The algorithm adopts DPFNN with the merits of single-layer feedforward neural network (SFNN) and MFNN as the criterion function, synchronously performs optimization of structure and selection of inputs based on a new defined fitness function keeping balance between network performance and complexity. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively remove the redundant features while improving the generalization ability of network.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424538","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424538.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature selection using Double Parallel Feedforward Neural Networks and Particle Swarm Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424538/","displayDocTitle":"Feature selection using Double Parallel Feedforward Neural Networks and Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889126","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424538/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature selection using Double Parallel Feedforward Neural Networks and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054356S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424541,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Shevertalov","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Shevertalov","id":"37296419300"},{"name":"Edward Stehle","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Stehle","id":"37296416200"},{"name":"Spiros Mancoridis","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Spiros","lastName":"Mancoridis","id":"37264963800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424541","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Histograms","Classification algorithms","Frequency","Application software","Telecommunication traffic","Computer science","Educational institutions","Genetic engineering","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","resource allocation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","binning problem","networked applications detection","network administrators","resource allocation","security policies","binned packet size distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424541","abstract":"Network administrators need a tool that detects the kind of applications running on their networks, in order to allocate resources and enforce security policies.

PNN algorithm takes the combinations two or three inputs to generates one partial description (PD) for the next layer. The output of the PDs becomes the input to the next layer. The number of PDs in each layer increases very fast, which consume lot of time for evaluation of the coefficients of the PDs, consume huge memory and increase complexity of the model. We propose simplified polynomial neural network (SPNN) for the task of classification. PDs for a single layer of the PNN model are developed. The outputs of these PDs along with the original inputs from the dataset are fed to a single perception model of artificial neural network (ANN) without any hidden layers. The ANN is trained with gradient descent method as well as with particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The results of both techniques for training are considered for the comparison of the performance. Simulation and result shows that the performance of SPNN is better than PNN model.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424542","startPage":"721","endPage":"728","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424542.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Polynomial Neural Network for classification task in data mining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Neural networks","Data mining","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","gradient methods","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simplified polynomial neural network","classification task","data mining","mathematical model","partial description","model complexity","artificial neural network","gradient descent method","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Polynomial Neural Network for classification task in data mining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424542/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889609","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Polynomial Neural Network for classification task in data mining","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080693S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424583,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej A.

In the light of the formal models of decentralized environments presented in the last decade, finding an optimal solution to a decentralized control problem is computationally prohibitive, even for moderately complicated environments. The problem, however, is of great significance since many of the real world systems can be treated as multi-agent systems with decentralized control. In this article, the authors propose an approximate algorithm for the problem based on a genetic algorithm. First, the problem is formalized using decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes. Then a way of representing a solution (joint policy) in a chromosome is introduced and a genetic algorithm is proposed as a search mechanism. Finally, a multi-agent tiger problem is used as an experimental framework to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424583","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1034","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424583.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving decentralized multi-agent control problems with genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Multiagent systems","Distributed control","Decision making","Control systems","Optimal control","Automatic control","Medical control systems","Centralized control","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralised control","decision making","decision theory","genetic algorithms","Markov processes","multi-agent systems","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized multi-agent control","genetic algorithm","decision making","approximate algorithm","decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes","search mechanism","multi-agent tiger problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Solving decentralized multi-agent control problems with genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424583/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889250","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving decentralized multi-agent control problems with genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055316S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":4424607,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This algorithm is inspired by swarming behaviors of bacteria, in particular, focusing on the study of tumble and run actions which are the major part of the chemotactic process. Adaptive tumble and run operators are developed to improve the global and local search capability of the BSA, based on the existing bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA). Simplified quorum-sensing mechanism is also incorporated to enhance the performance of this algorithm. BSA has been evaluated, in comparison with existing evolutionary algorithms (EAs), such as fast evolutionary programming (FEP) and particle swarm optimizer (PSO), on a number of mathematical benchmark functions.

It is important to determine the relationships between climatic factors and disease incidence trends, which would be helpful for relevant environment and health agencies in planning appropriate pre-emptive control measures. Climatic factors and dengue case records vary over time. It is therefore difficult to justify the time-lag when a climatic factor affects the mosquito-to-human and human-to-mosquito loops.

In this paper the influence of population re-initialization on the parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) performance is experimentally analyzed. In various PGA architectures three types of re-initialization are described. Next the following factors are studied: re-initialization period and the number of re-initialized nodes. The results are demonstrated on the minimization of real number test functions.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424625","startPage":"1333","endPage":"1338","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424625.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Aspects of Parallel Genetic Algorithms with Population Re-initialization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424625/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Some Aspects of Parallel Genetic Algorithms with Population Re-initialization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424625/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889403","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Aspects of Parallel Genetic Algorithms with Population Re-initialization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044851S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424628,"authors":[{"name":"Lukas Dolivka","affiliation":["Department of Circuit Theory, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Dolivka","id":"37087583308"},{"name":"Jiri Hospodka","affiliation":["Department of Circuit Theory, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Hospodka","id":"38243072600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424628","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424628","abstract":"The optimization of a circuit based on the switched-current technique is described in this paper. The differential evolution - one of the evolutionary algorithm - is used for the optimization. The circuit is applied to low-pass filter realization. The optimization takes into account three requirements. Hence, it is multi-objective (multi-criteria) optimization. The first requirement is the elimination of the of the nonidealities in the circuit on its magnitude frequency response. The nonidealities are the nonzero output conductance of the field-effect transistors realizing the current sources and the nonzero on-state resistance of the switches. The second and third fact respected by the optimization is concerned with the values of transconductances of the transistors in the circuit. The ratio between the highest and lowest one (the spread of transconductance values) and the sum of all of them should be as small as possible. The reason is a better cicuit design. The aim of the optimization is to obtain suitable values of the transconductances satisfying the three requirements.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424628","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1358","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424628.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using deferential evolution algorithm for the multi-objective optimization of a switched-current circuit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching circuits","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","field effect transistors","frequency response","low-pass filters","network synthesis","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential evolution algorithm","multiobjective optimization","switched-current circuit","evolutionary algorithms","low-pass filter realization","multicriteria optimization","magnitude frequency response","field-effect transistors","nonzero on-state resistance","transconductances","circuit design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Using deferential evolution algorithm for the multi-objective optimization of a switched-current circuit","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424628/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889627","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using deferential evolution algorithm for the multi-objective optimization of a switched-current circuit","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091097S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424630,"authors":[{"name":"Juan C.

The interactive genetic algorithm combines computable user interface design metrics with subjective user input to guide evolution. Individuals in our population represent interface specifications and we compute an individual's fitness from a weighted combination of user input and user interface design guidelines. Results from our preliminary study involving three users indicate that users are able to effectively bias evolution towards user interface designs that reflect both user preferences and computed guideline metrics. Furthermore, we can reduce fatigue, defined by the number of choices needing to be made by the human designer, by doing two things. First, asking the user to pick just two (the best and worst) user interfaces from among a subset of nine shown. Second, asking the user to make the choice once every t generations, instead of every single generation. Our goal is to provide interface designers with an interactive tool that can be used to explore innovation and creativity in the design space of user interfaces.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424630","startPage":"1366","endPage":"1373","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424630.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Genetic Algorithms for User Interface Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","User interfaces","Algorithm design and analysis","Guidelines","Fatigue","Computer interfaces","Space exploration","Humans","Technological innovation","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","interactive systems","user interface management systems","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user interface design","interactive genetic algorithm","XML interface definition language","interface specifications","computed guideline metrics","XUL","user fatigue reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Genetic Algorithms for User Interface Design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889643","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Genetic Algorithms for User Interface Design","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06912S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4424632,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Mantere","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, University of Vaasa, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Mantere","id":"37372629300"},{"name":"Janne Koljonen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Koljonen","id":"37267735700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424632","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1726},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Testing","Optimization methods","Automation","Humans","Wikipedia","Europe","Gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Sudoku puzzles","genetic algorithms","multiobjective optimization problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424632","abstract":"This paper studies the problems involved in solving, rating and generating Sudoku puzzles with genetic algorithms (GA). Sudoku is a number puzzle that has recently become a worldwide phenomenon. Sudoku can be regarded as a constraint satisfaction problem. When solved with genetic algorithms it can be handled as a multi-objective optimization problem. The three objectives of this study was: 1. to test if genetic algorithm optimization is an efficient method for solving Sudoku puzzles, 2. can GA be used to generate new puzzles efficiently, and 3. can GA be used as a rating machine that evaluates the difficulty of a given Sudoku puzzle. The last of these objectives is approached by testing if puzzles that are considered difficult for a human solver are also difficult for the genetic algorithm. The results presented in this paper seem to support the conclusion that these objectives are reasonably well met with genetic algorithm optimization.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424632","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424632.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1389","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving, rating and generating Sudoku puzzles with GA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Solving, rating and generating Sudoku puzzles with GA","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9889358","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4424632/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving, rating and generating Sudoku puzzles with GA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064692S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4424635,"authors":[{"name":"Emilio G.

So GAs are most appropriate for multi objective optimization problems, in which there is no single value to be minimized or maximized, but having multiple objectives, usually with tradeoffs involved: one can only be improved at the expense of another. By looking at this strength of GA we have applied MultiObjective GA to support QoS Routing in Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET). A MANET is dynamic multi-hop wireless network established by a group of mobile nodes on a shared wireless channel by virtue of their proximity to each other. To support mobility to user generally low configured nodes are in use, so limited resources, dynamic network topology and link variations are the issues with MANET. So, Routing in such a dynamic environment is a challenging issue, lots of work has been done for routing in MANET but QoS (Quality of Service) requirements are not yet supported that way, and in this scenario to find optimal path is a problem of NP class. We have applied MultiObjective Genetic algorithm: to optimize four QoS parameters bandwidth constraints, delay, traffic from adjacent nodes, and number of hops, and to provide adaptive route in MANET. Our experiment is based on Network Simulator NS-2.28 and results show that GA based approach is better than traditional method.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424638","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1428","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424638.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi objective genetic algorithm based adaptive QoS routing in MANET","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Routing","Mobile ad hoc networks","Quality of service","Ad hoc networks","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Network topology","Constraint optimization","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","genetic algorithms","mobile radio","quality of service","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc network","MANET","multi objective genetic algorithm","adaptive QoS routing","quality of service","dynamic multi hop wireless network","shared wireless channel","dynamic network topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi objective genetic algorithm based adaptive QoS routing in MANET","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424638/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889584","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi objective genetic algorithm based adaptive QoS routing in MANET","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126835S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4424639,"authors":[{"name":"Jason C.

We will experiment using the protein location data from the Horton and Nakai yeast and E.Coli databases. We will then compare the performance of our optimized system with previous methods. Results show that GA enhanced kernel component analysis can improve classification.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424639","startPage":"1429","endPage":"1435","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424639.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced prediction of protein cellular localization sites with genetic algorithm optimal kernel projection analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Genetic algorithms","Kernel","Algorithm design and analysis","Machine learning algorithms","Support vector machines","Performance analysis","Principal component analysis","Fungi","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein cellular localization sites","genetic algorithm optimal kernel projection analysis","machine learning algorithms","e.coli databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classification.","Genetic Algorithms","Kernel Methods","Projection Analysis","Manifold Learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced prediction of protein cellular localization sites with genetic algorithm optimal kernel projection analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424639/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889405","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced prediction of protein cellular localization sites with genetic algorithm optimal kernel projection analysis","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104406S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4424643,"authors":[{"name":"Hironobu Sasaki","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Hironobu Sasaki","id":"37273026500"},{"name":"Naoyuki Kubota","affiliation":["SORST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan","Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoyuki Kubota","id":"37275324300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424643","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424643","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","control engineering computing","genetic algorithms","mobile robots","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavior learning","multiple mobile robots","spiking neural networks","parallel genetic algorithm","artificial neural networks","sensory inputs","motor outputs","collision avoidance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424643","startPage":"1456","endPage":"1461","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavior learning of multiple mobile robots based on spiking neural networks with a parallel genetic algorithm","abstract":"Recently, various types of artificial neural networks are applied for behavioral learning of mobile robots in unknown and dynamic environments.

The algorithm utilizes both bootstrap of training data and random feature subspace techniques to generate an initial and diverse ensemble and evolves the ensem ble with negative correlation learning. The idea of generating ensemble by simultaneous randomization of data and feature is to promote the diversity within the ensemble and encourage different individual NNs in the ensemble to learn different parts or aspects of the training data so that the ensemble can learn better the entire training data. Evolving the ensemble with negative correlation learning emphasizes not only the accuracy of individual NNs but also the cooperation among different individual NNs and thus improves the generalization. As a byproduct of bootstrap, out-of-bag (0013) estimation, which can estimate the generalization performance without any extra data points, serves another benefit of this algorithm. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by several benchmark problems and in these cases the performance of our algorithm is better than the performance of other ensemble algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424645","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1474","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424645.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary random neural ensembles based on negative correlation learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424645/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary random neural ensembles based on negative correlation learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424645/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889722","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary random neural ensembles based on negative correlation learning","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095879S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424649,"authors":[{"name":"Naoyuki Kubota","affiliation":["SORST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan","Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoyuki Kubota","id":"37087313448"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Shimizu","affiliation":["Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Toshiyuki Shimizu","id":"37087810743"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424649","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424649","abstract":"This paper proposes a steady-state genetic algorithm for trajectory generation used in the imitation of a partner robot interacting with a human.

Thus determining robot\u2019s position is one of the most important tasks in mobile robotics. This task consists of \u201cglobal localization\u201f and \u201crobot\u2019s pose tracking\u201f. In this paper two recent sample-based evolutionary methods for globally localizing the position of a mobile robot are proposed. The first method is a modified version of genetic algorithm called Differential Evolution (DE) which is based on natural selection. The second one is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is based on bird flocking. DE evaluates initial population using the probabilistic motion and observation models and the evolution of the individuals is performed by evolutionary operators. PSO adjusts the velocity and location of particles towards target (robot\u2019s pose) through a problem space on the basis of information about each particle\u2019s previous best location and the best previous location of its neighbors. Our results illustrate the excellence of these two methods over standard Monte Carlo localization algorithm with regard to convergence rate, speed and computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424654","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1534","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424654.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile robot global localization using differential evolution and particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424654/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mobile robot global localization using differential evolution and particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424654/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889226","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile robot global localization using differential evolution and particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11129S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424655,"authors":[{"name":"Indra Adji Sulistijono","affiliation":["The Department of Mechatronics, Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya (EEPIS-ITS), Surabaya, Indonesia","The Department of Mechanical Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Indra Adji Sulistijono","id":"37087535873"},{"name":"Naoyuki Kubota","affiliation":["The Department of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoyuki Kubota","id":"37087313448"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424655","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424655","abstract":"This paper discusses the advantage and disadvantage of evolutionary robot vision and particle swarm optimization for multiple human heads tracking.

The rational for this combination is that type-2 fuzzy sets are better able to deal with rule uncertainties, while the optimal GA-based tuning of the T2GA-TSKfnn parameters achieves better classification results. However, a general T2GA-TSKfnn is computationally very intensive due to the complexity of the type-2 to type-1 reduction. Therefore, we adopt an interval T2GA-TSKfnn implementation to simplify the computational process. Simulation results are provided to compare the T2GA-TSKfnn against other fuzzy neural networks.

A necessary consequence of this increased capability is a higher degree of complexity, which in turn leads to gradient-based learning algorithms for RNNs being more likely to be trapped in local optima, thus resulting in sub- optimal solutions. This motivates the use of evolutionary computational methods which center about the use of population- based global-search techniques as an optimization scheme. In this article, we propose the use of a hybrid evolutionary strategy (ES) approach together with an adaptive linear observer, acting as a local search operator, as a learning mechanism for general RNN applications.

While \"better\" solutions should be rated higher than \"worse\" ones, the resulting cost landscapes must also comply with requirements such as continuity and differentiability of the cost surface. The genetic algorithm (GA), which has found application in many areas not amenable to optimization by other methods, is a random search technique which requires the assignment of a scalar measure of quality, or fitness, to candidate solutions. This paper proposes that the fitness assignment be interpreted as, or at least related to, a multicriterion decision process. A suitable decision-making framework, based on goals and priority, is subsequently formulated in term of fuzzy reasoning and shown to encompass a number of simpler decision strategies. Since the GA is a random search process and therefore takes more time to find a solution in the problem domain, a proper search direction is required in order to produce an optimum result. Fuzzy logic cannot provide an exact solution but can be used as a useful tool for reasoning. In this paper, the reasoning capability of fuzzy logic is used to provide a proper direction for genetic search in a problem domain and thus to achieve faster convergence in the GA. The effectiveness of this is shown in neural network optimization applied to dynamic modelling of an experimental flexible manipulator. The results show that the new fuzzy logic approach is superior to conventional exploration of the genetic search region.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424671","startPage":"1648","endPage":"1653","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424671.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic for priority based genetic search in evolving a neural network architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Neural networks","Constraint optimization","Costs","Manipulator dynamics","Genetic algorithms","Optimization methods","Area measurement","Decision making","Fuzzy reasoning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","decision making","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","neural net architecture","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","priority based genetic search","neural network optimization","genetic algorithm","random search technique","fitness assignment","multicriterion decision process","decision making","fuzzy reasoning","convergence rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic for priority based genetic search in evolving a neural network architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424671/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889247","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic for priority based genetic search in evolving a neural network architecture","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067436S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4424673,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong-Qiu Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China","Inteligent Computing Lab, Hefei Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Zhong-Qiu Zhao","id":"37087398233"},{"name":"De-Shuang Huang","affiliation":["Inteligent Computing Lab, Hefei Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"De-Shuang Huang","id":"37087142703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424673","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Pattern classification","Evolutionary computation","Machine intelligence","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary modular neural network","unbalanced pattern classification","multiclass problem","unbalanced training set","symmetrical two-class problem","averaging","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424673","abstract":"In this paper, an evolutionary modular neural network is proposed to solve multi-class problems with unbalanced training sets.

This work consists mainly of two contributions. The first is to develop a mixed optimization approach with genetic algorithm (GA) and back propagation (BP) training for the ENN. In particular, the crossover operator of the genetic algorithm is performed with multiple neural networks that have heterogeneous structures: either different number of nodes in a hidden layer or different number of hidden layers. Hence, this optimization process enables co-evolution of multiple NN structures which present different nonlinear models, and facilitates the selection of the most suitable forecasting model from multiple candidates. To expedite the searching process for ENN and meanwhile retain an efficient learning rate, the back- propagation training is applied only to the best or the second best chromosome in each generation. The second contribution of this work is the application of the ENN to a real forecasting problem arising from a car-sharing system. Despite the presence of randomness, nonlinearity and complexity in the forecasting process, the ENN demonstrates superior performance when comparing with both classics time series forecasting approaches and other soft-computing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424674","startPage":"1670","endPage":"1676","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424674.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new Evolutionary Neural Network for forecasting net flow of a car sharing system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424674/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new Evolutionary Neural Network for forecasting net flow of a car sharing system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424674/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889714","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new Evolutionary Neural Network for forecasting net flow of a car sharing system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058279S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4424687,"authors":[{"name":"Nayan R.

To make Experiment-Based EMO (EBEMO) using the HILS environment feasible, the most important pre-requisite is reduction of the number of necessary fitness evaluations. In this paper, we apply an acceleration method using fitness estimation to overcome the aforementioned problem for EBEMO of real internal-combustion engines, and the effectiveness of our proposal is examined through real engine experiments.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424688","startPage":"1777","endPage":"1784","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424688.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acceleration of Experiment-Based Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization of internal-combustion engine controllers using fitness estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Engines","Automotive engineering","Design optimization","Torque control","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Hardware","Calibration","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","internal combustion engines","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["experiment-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization","internal-combustion engine controller","fitness estimation","control parameters","automotive engine","environmental emission","fuel consumption","engine torque","hardware in the loop simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration of Experiment-Based Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization of internal-combustion engine controllers using fitness estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424688/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889500","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acceleration of Experiment-Based Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization of internal-combustion engine controllers using fitness estimation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076446S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424713,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Poli","affiliation":["University of Essex, UK"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Poli","id":"37444709300"},{"name":"Dan Bratton","affiliation":["Goldsmiths College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Bratton","id":"37703339900"},{"name":"Tim Blackwell","affiliation":["Goldsmiths College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Blackwell","id":"37330097900"},{"name":"Jim Kennedy","affiliation":["US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37276103200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424713","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Mathematical model","Sampling methods","Stability analysis","Communication standards","Benchmark testing","Topology","Random variables","Algebra","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimiser","mathematical transformation","probabilistic effects","stability analysis","sampling distribution","stagnation","communication topology"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we derive a simpler form of Particle Swarm Optimiser (PSO) which still retains the key properties of the original model.

Although most neural network training uses gradient based schemes such as wellknown back-propagation (BP), but sometimes BP is easily dropped into local minima. In this paper, we train multi-branch neural networks using RasID-GA with constraint coefficient C by which the feasible solution space is controlled. In addition, we use Mackey-Glass time prediction to test a generalization ability of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424727","startPage":"2064","endPage":"2070","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424727.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training of Multi-Branch Neural Networks using RasID-GA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Pattern recognition","Modeling","Probability density function","Testing","Production systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","random processes","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibranch neural network","adaptive random search","genetic algorithm","Mackey-Glass time prediction","RasID-GA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Training of Multi-Branch Neural Networks using RasID-GA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424727/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889442","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training of Multi-Branch Neural Networks using RasID-GA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055132S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424730,"authors":[{"name":"Dimo Brockhoff","affiliation":["The Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dimo","lastName":"Brockhoff","id":"37831210700"},{"name":"Eckart Zitzler","affiliation":["The Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Eckart","lastName":"Zitzler","id":"37276597600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424730","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"abstract":"Hypervolume based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) nowadays seem to be the first choice when handling multiobjective optimization problems with many, i.e., at least three objectives. Experimental studies have shown that hypervolume-based search algorithms as SMS-EMOA can outperform established algorithms like NSGA-II and SPEA2. One problem remains with most of the hypervolume based algorithms: the best known algorithm for computing the hypervolume needs time exponentially in the number of objectives. To save computation time during hypervolume computation which can be better spent in the generation of more solutions, we propose a general approach how objective reduction techniques can be incorporated into hypervolume based algorithms. Different objective reduction strategies are developed and then compared in an experimental study on two test problems with up to nine objectives. The study indicates that the (temporary) omission of objectives can improve hypervolume based MOEAs drastically in terms of the achieved hypervolume indicator values.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Principal component analysis","Testing","Decision making","Pareto analysis","Data mining","Optimization methods","Pareto optimization","Visualization","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypervolume-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms","objective reduction methods","hypervolume-based search algorithms","NSGA-II","SPEA2","hypervolume indicator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424730","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424730","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424730.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424730","startPage":"2086","endPage":"2093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving hypervolume-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms by using objective reduction methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving hypervolume-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms by using objective reduction methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424730/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424730/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889552","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving hypervolume-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms by using objective reduction methods","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074903S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-14"},{"_id":4424735,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Shri Deva Raj Chair Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Kalyanmoy","lastName":"Deb","id":"37272206800"},{"name":"Abhay Kumar","affiliation":["Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Abhay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37834836200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424735","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":736},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Delta modulation","Optimization methods","Decision making","Testing","Design engineering","Computational modeling","Reliability engineering","Design methodology","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","evolutionary computation","operations research","problem solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light beam search","multi-objective optimization","evolutionary algorithms","complex practical optimization problems","Pareto-optimal solutions","decision-making activities","multiple criteria decision making literature"]}],"abstract":"For the past decade or so, evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) methodologies have earned wide popularity for solving complex practical optimization problems, simply due to their ability to find a representative set of Pareto-optimal solutions for mostly two, three, and some extent to four and five-objective optimization problems. Recently, emphasis has been made in addressing the decision-making activities in arriving at a single preferred solution. The multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) literature offers a number of possibilities for such a task involving user preferences which can be supplied in different forms. This paper presents an interactive methodology for finding a preferred set of solutions, instead of the complete Pareto-optimal frontier, by incorporating preference information of the decision maker. Particularly, we borrow the concept of light beam search and combine it with the NSGA-II procedure. The working of this procedure has been demonstrated on a set of test problems and on engineering design problems having two to ten objectives, where the obtained solutions are found to match with the true Pareto-optimal solutions. The results highlight the utility of this approach towards eventually facilitating a better and more reliable optimization-cum-decision-making task.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424735.pdf","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light beam search based multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Light beam search based multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889712","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4424735/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light beam search based multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050961S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4424740,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Banerjee","affiliation":["Evolutionary Computing Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada,\uc2a0Reno, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37274347900"},{"name":"Sushil J.

The results indicate that using an EMO approach simplifies the decision process of choosing a parameter set for a given problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424754/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889457","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424754/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization of Particle Swarm Optimizers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization of Particle Swarm Optimizers","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128929S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424756,"authors":[{"name":"Peng-Yeng Yin","affiliation":["The Department of Information Management, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Peng-Yeng Yin","id":"37087387923"},{"name":"Fred Glover","affiliation":["The Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Glover","id":"37271797000"},{"name":"Manuel Laguna","affiliation":["The Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Laguna","id":"37286968800"},{"name":"Jia-Xian Zhu","affiliation":["The Department of Information Management, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jia-Xian Zhu","id":"37087611666"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424756","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424756","abstract":"A fertile complementarity exists between scatter search (SS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO).

The algorithm evolves the architecture of the ANN and trains its weights simultaneously. Different from the other techniques previously used, the proposed algorithm evolves the architecture along with the weights in two different layers. Tested on a non-linear system, typically a boost converter, the DLPSO evolves an optimal ANN controller to produce more efficient and robust results than the conventional control techniques used. The performance of the DLPSO based ANN controller is compared to that of a conventional PI controller at different operating points of the non-linear system. The tests show that the evolved controller performs equal to or better than the conventional techniques in terms of overshoot voltages and settling times for small and large signal input transients. Also, a comparison between the applicability of a PSO and a real-valued genetic algorithm for the training of weights is presented which shows that the PSO is faster and more efficient as a learning algorithm. Moreover, the proposed approach fully automates the neural network generation process, thus removing the need for time consuming manual design.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424765","startPage":"2350","endPage":"2357","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424765.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual layered PSO Algorithm for evolving an Artificial Neural Network controller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Optimal control","Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation","Algorithm design and analysis","System testing","Robust control","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","nonlinear systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual layered PSO algorithm","artificial neural network controller","particle swarm optimization","evolutionary algorithm","nonlinear system","optimal ANN controller","PI controller","real-valued genetic algorithm","learning algorithm","neural network generation process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Swarm Intelligence","Artificial Neural Networks","Controller design","Boost converter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Dual layered PSO Algorithm for evolving an Artificial Neural Network controller","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424765/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889692","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual layered PSO Algorithm for evolving an Artificial Neural Network controller","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047803S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424766,"authors":[{"name":"Annemari Auvinen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Annemari","lastName":"Auvinen","id":"37689580900"},{"name":"Teemu Keltanen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"lastName":"Teemu Keltanen","id":"37087344129"},{"name":"Mikko Vapa","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Vapa","id":"37421354400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424766","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424766","abstract":"Resource discovery is an essential problem in peer- to-peer networks since there is no centralized index in which to look for information about resources.

In addition to developing different kinds of resource discovery algorithms, one approach is to study the different topologies or structures of the P2P network. In many cases topology management is based on either technical characteristics of the peers or their interests based on the previous resource queries. In this paper, we propose a topology management algorithm which does not predetermine favorable values of the characteristics of the peers. The decision whether to connect to a certain peer is done by a neural network, which is trained with an evolutionary algorithm.

Despite the success and surge in interests on MAs, there is still plenty of scope for furthering our understanding on how and why synergy between population- based and individual learning searchers would lead to successful Memetic Algorithms. In this paper we outline several important design issues of Memetic Algorithms and present a systematic study on each. In particular, we conduct extensive experimental studies on the impact of each individual design issue and their relative impacts on memetic search performances by means of three commonly used synthetic problems.

PRT is a novel transportation paradigm, where many computer-controlled vehicles running on an elevated guideway network (GN). A GN may contain hundreds of guideway links and how to design the minimum-cost feasible GN is a challenging problem. Given a set of stations, the proposed GA models a candidate GN as a union of one or more simple directed cycles visiting two or more stations. This cycle representation not only provides high solution locality but allows us to establish a contraction digraph model, where its feasibility can be efficiently evaluated. We also develop special genetic operators well suited for the cycle representation. Numerical experiments conducted for various problem instances show the proposed GA outperforms the conventional ones once the solution is represented by a moderate number of cycles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424772/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889202","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424772/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm with cycle representation and contraction digraph model for Guideway Network design of Personal Rapid Transit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm with cycle representation and contraction digraph model for Guideway Network design of Personal Rapid Transit","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108143S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424775,"authors":[{"name":"Rolf Dornberger","affiliation":["Institute for Information Systems, University of Applied Sciences, North-Western Switzerland, Basel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Dornberger","id":"37692019200"},{"name":"Lukas Frey","affiliation":["Institute for Information Systems, University of Applied Sciences, North-Western Switzerland, Basel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Frey","id":"37700210500"},{"name":"Claudia Schmid","affiliation":["Qnamic Limited, Hagendorf, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37840797300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424775","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Resource management","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","genetic algorithms","railway engineering","resource allocation","software agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","distributed resource management software","resource planning","railway","service planning","vehicle rotation planning","personnel rotation planning","operations management","distributed software product","RailOpt"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424775","abstract":"Resource management and planning in railway operating companies is a highly complex task.

The results show that tolerance is a property that can be sought by evolution rather than an inherent property of the organism, i.e. genomes that have explicitly been exposed to environmental changes.

This agent consists of an Artificial Neural Network whose weights are updated by the temporal differences (TD) reinforcement learning methods. The NET-FEATUREMAP mapping is used to represent a game board state in the Network input. The network output corresponds to a real number (prediction) that indicates to what extent the input state is favorable to the agent. The agent is trained by self-play coupled with a cloning technique. The minimax algorithm is used to choose the best action to be executed considering the current game board state. Such a learning process is close to that proposed by Mark Lynch (NeuroDraughts). However, the LS-Draughts expands the NeuroDraughts as it automatically generates an effective and concise set of features to be used in the NET-FEATUREMAP mapping, whereas the latter uses a fixed and manually defined set of features. A tournament was promoted between the best player obtained by the LS-Draughts and the best available player of the NeuroDraughts. The tournament was won by the player of the LS-Draughts, which confirms that the GAs can be an important tool for improving the general performance of automatic players.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424788/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889421","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424788/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LS-Draughts - A Draughts Learning System based on genetic algorithms, neural network and temporal differences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LS-Draughts - A Draughts Learning System based on genetic algorithms, neural network and temporal differences","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092919S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4424808,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Vergidis","affiliation":["Doctoral Reseacher at Manufaturing Department, school of Applied Sciences, Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Vergidis","id":"37691854100"},{"name":"Ashutosh Tiwari","affiliation":["Manufacturing Department School of Applied Sciences, Cranfield University, UK"],"firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37275762900"},{"name":"Basim Majeed","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Group, ISRC Laboratory, BT, UK"],"firstName":"Basim","lastName":"Majeed","id":"37267879100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424808","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Process design","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corporate modelling","evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite business processes","evolutionary multiobjective optimization","business process optimization","business process modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424808","abstract":"Business process optimization has received little coverage compared to business process modeling and analysis techniques.

In this networked society, the role of a human being is evolving from the data consumer to the data producer. In these changing circumstances, pipelined processing finds applications where the data obtained from the human producer needs to be processed and interpreted in real-time. For example, in an M- Health system, the vital signs acquired from the patient are processed in the pipelined fashion. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach for the optimal assignment of pipelined processing tasks onto a chain of networked devices that minimizes total end-to-end processing delay considering knowledge about the communication and computation resources as the context information. Although some existing graph-based algorithms can solve this problem in polynomial time, we expect that GA can take less computational time and requires less memory while providing a reasonably good assignment. We compare the performance of GA approach with the graph-based approaches. It is observed that when the number of devices and the number of processing tasks are large, the GA approach performs better in terms of the satisfactory quality of the obtained sub-optimal solution considering the advantage of reduced computational time.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424811","startPage":"2695","endPage":"2702","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424811.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-aware task assignment in ubiquitous computing environment - A genetic algorithm based approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ubiquitous computing","Genetic algorithms","Context","Computer networks","Humans","Mobile computing","Handheld computers","Pervasive computing","Communication networks","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","pipeline processing","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-aware task assignment","ubiquitous computing","genetic algorithm","optimal assignment","pipelined processing task","networked devices","end-to-end processing delay","computation resource","context information","graph-based algorithm","polynomial time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Context-aware task assignment in ubiquitous computing environment - A genetic algorithm based approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424811/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889440","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-aware task assignment in ubiquitous computing environment - A genetic algorithm based approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086949S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424815,"authors":[{"name":"Nand Kishor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineerin, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4424445/4424446/4424815/4424815-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nand Kishor (M 2005) was born in Allahabad, India on July 12, 1975.

However, they consist of heterogeneous computing nodes, in terms of computational power, operating platform, network connectivity and latency. The behavior of parallel memetic algorithms in such environment is poorly understood: the vast majority of current parallel MAs assumes homogeneous environment. To deal with the heterogeneity of the computing resources, a hierarchical model PMA (hPMA-DLS) is proposed to provide the speed-up regardless of the heterogeneity in the distributed environment while preserving the standard behavior of the PMA. The empirical study on several large scale quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) shows that hPMA-DLS can enhance the efficiency of the island model PMA-DLS search without deterioration in the solution quality.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424820","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424820.pdf","startPage":"2758","endPage":"2765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical model parallel memetic algorithm in heterogeneous computing environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical model parallel memetic algorithm in heterogeneous computing environment","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424820/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889715","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical model parallel memetic algorithm in heterogeneous computing environment","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076656S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4424825,"authors":[{"name":"Kusum Deep","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttrakhand, India"],"firstName":"Kusum","lastName":"Deep","id":"37598145400"},{"name":"Dipti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttrakhand, India"],"lastName":"Dipti","id":"37831153000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424825","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organizing","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self organizing migrating genetic algorithm","function optimization","binary coded genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424825","abstract":"This paper presents a new self organizing migrating genetic algorithm (SOMGA) for function optimization, which is inspired by the features of self organizing migrating algorithm (SOMA).

This paper reports our work on applying genetic algorithms on measurement-based load modeling research. Due to its robustness to the initial guesses on the load model parameter identification. Two cases including both the real measurement in a power station and the digital simulation are studied in the paper. For comparison purpose, the classical nonlinear least square estimation method is also applied to find the load model parameters. The simulated outputs from the load model confirm the efficiency of genetic algorithms in measurement-based load modeling analysis.

This paper also examines the following strategies in the implementation of local search: applying local search only to final solutions, applying local search to solutions only in the early generations, and initializing local search when mutation gives rise to improvement in the solution. Simulation results from a target matching test problem indicate that the hybrid algorithm outperforms the multi-objective method without genetic local search when the implementation of local search is appropriate. It is also shown that the hybridization can improve the convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424847/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889510","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424847/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for multiobjective structural optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for multiobjective structural optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063642S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424850,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhao","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory for Complex Systems and Intelligence cience, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Liang Zhao","id":"37087151656"},{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["The Program for Advanced Research in Complex Systems, Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA","The Key Laboratory for Complex Systems and Intelligence cience, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fei-Yue Wang","id":"37087150444"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424850","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424850","abstract":"A novel hybrid learning algorithm to implement automatically structure identification and parameter optimiza tion for designing a self-organizing TSK-Type fuzzy neural network (FNN) is proposed in this paper.

That is, the MSC is used to partition the input vector space to generate initial network structure. Then the MFS is used to prune the least important rule neurons of initial structure and generate optimal network structure. After the structure identification is completed, the PSO-EGA is adopted to perform a global search in free parameter space of the FNN and seek a near optimal initial free parameters point for the next stage. Then, it is considered as the initial weights of the FNN and the MBP is used to perform the learning process until a terminal condition is satisfied.

The proposed operator, named CQA-MEC (Constraint Quadratic Approximation for Multiple Equality Constraints), performs the steps: (i) the approximation of the non-linear constraints via quadratic functions; (ii) the determination of exact equality-constrained projections of some points onto the approximated constraint surface, via an iterative projection algorithm; and (iii) the re-insertion of the constraint- satisfying points in the genetic algorithm population. This operator can be interpreted both as a local search engine (that employs local approximations of constraint functions for correcting the feasibility) and a kind of elitism operator for equality constrained problems that plays the role of \"fixing\" the best estimates of the feasible set. The proposed operator has the advantage of not requiring any additional function evaluation per algorithm iteration, solely making usage of the information that is already obtained in the course of the usual genetic algorithm iterations.

A series-parallel system consists of subsystems that are connected in series and each subsystem consists of components in parallel. There are some heuristic methods to obtain quasi optimal solutions for the component allocation problem of series-parallel systems. Because this problem is one of the NP-complete problems, it is difficult to obtain the exact solutions for large scale problems. We had formulated this problem as a multi-objective optimization problem minimizing the system cost and maximizing the system reliability, and proposed an algorithm that obtains the exact solutions of the problems in an efficient way. The algorithm utilized the depth-first search method to eliminate useless searches and employs the branch-and-bound method to obtain the Pareto solutions. According to the results of our numerical experiments, the algorithm searches the Pareto solutions in practical time for not so large problems. In order to solve larger problems, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). In comparison with the exact solution method we had proposed and the MOGA method, we assure the MOGA method produces the best compromised solutions and the later can solve large scale problems. We have conducted experiments for reasonably large scale problems and have demonstrated reasonably good performance of our method.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424861","startPage":"3058","endPage":"3064","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424861.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A solution method employing a multi-objective genetic algorithm to search for pareto solutions of series-parallel system component allocation problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","resource allocation","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective genetic algorithm","pareto solutions","series-parallel system component allocation problem","optimal system component allocation problem","interchangeable elements","heuristic methods","NP-complete problems","large scale problems","multiobjective optimization problem","depth-first search","branch-and-bound method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A solution method employing a multi-objective genetic algorithm to search for pareto solutions of series-parallel system component allocation problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424861/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889473","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A solution method employing a multi-objective genetic algorithm to search for pareto solutions of series-parallel system component allocation problem","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046676S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424862,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Unveren","affiliation":["Eastern Mediterranean University, Computer Engineering Department, TRNC, Via Mersin 10, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Unveren","id":"37564776800"},{"name":"Adnan Acan","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Eastern Mediterranean University, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Acan","id":"37282625500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424862","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424862","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pareto optimization","Entropy","Stochastic processes","Probability distribution","Clustering algorithms","Optimization methods","Discrete event simulation","Ant colony optimization","Space exploration","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","cross entropy method","stochastic learning","clustered Pareto fronts"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424862","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424862.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"3065","endPage":"3071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization with cross entropy method: Stochastic learning with clustered pareto fronts","abstract":"This paper presents a novel multiobjective optimization strategy based on the cross entropy method (MOCE).

This paper presents a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for multiobjective particle swarm optimization (COMOPSO), which applies the divide-and-conquer approach to decompose decision vectors into smaller components and evolves multiple solutions in the form of cooperative subswarms. Representatives from each evolving subswarm are combined to form the solution to the whole system. The fitness of each individual is related to its ability to collaborate with individuals from other species, thereby encouraging the development of cooperative strategies. An adaptive niche sharing algorithm is introduced to handle the selection of the niche radius in a dynamic manner. Coupled with the adaptive niche sharing algorithm COMOPSO demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency in evolving highly competitive solution sets against various MO algorithms on benchmark problems characterized by different difficulties with consistent results.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424878.pdf","startPage":"3180","endPage":"3186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for multiobjective particle swarm optimization","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for multiobjective particle swarm optimization","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889460","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4424878/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for multiobjective particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074536S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4424884,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar W.

In the past the least mean square algorithm (LMS), genetic algorithm (GA) etc. have been employed for developing a parallel model. During training by LMS algorithm the weights rattle around and does not converge to optimal solution. This gives rise to poor performance of the model. Although GA always ensures the convergence of the weights to the global optimum but it suffers from slower convergence rate. To alleviate the problem we propose a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique for identifying nonlinear systems. The PSO is also a population based derivative free optimization technique like GA, and hence ascertains the convergence of the model parameters to the global optimum, there by yielding the same performance as provided by GA but with a faster speed. Comprehensive computer simulations validate that the PSO based identification is a better candidate even under noisy condition both in terms of convergence speed as well as number of input samples used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424889/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889341","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424889/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identification of nonlinear systems using particle swarm optimization technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of nonlinear systems using particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061139S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-21"},{"_id":4424890,"authors":[{"name":"Shinichi Nakano","affiliation":["Electrical and Information System Engineering Department, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Shinichi Nakano","id":"37087914999"},{"name":"Atsushi Ishigame","affiliation":["Electrical and Information System Engineering Department, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Atsushi Ishigame","id":"37087914227"},{"name":"Keiichiro Yasuda","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Keiichiro Yasuda","id":"37087912975"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424890","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","Tabu search","local optimal solution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424890","abstract":"This paper presents a new Particle Swarm Optimization based on the concept of Tabu Search (TS-PSO). In PSO, when a particle finds a local optimal solution, all of the particles gather around the one, and cannot escape from it. On the other hand, TS can escape from the local optimal solution by moving away from the best solution at the present. The proposed TS-PSO is the method for combining the excellence of both PSO and TS. In this method, particles are divided into two categories called swarml and swarml. And they play the key roles of intensification and diversification respectively. Swarml playing roles of intensification searches the area around the best solution at the present, and swarml playing roles of diversification intends to avoid local optimal solutions and to find global optimal one. Then, the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations with several functions which are well known as optimization benchmark problems comparing to the conventional PSO methods.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424890","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424890.pdf","startPage":"3258","endPage":"3263","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based on the concept of tabu search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based on the concept of tabu search","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9889531","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4424890/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization based on the concept of tabu search","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055111S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424891,"authors":[{"name":"The Jin Ai","affiliation":["Industical Engineering and Management, School of Engineering and Technology,  Asian Institute of Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"lastName":"The Jin Ai","id":"37087387941"},{"name":"Voratas Kachitvichyanukul","affiliation":["Industical Engineering and Management, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Voratas","lastName":"Kachitvichyanukul","id":"37373015500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424891","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization dynamic behavior","iteration process","dispersion index","velocity index"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424891","abstract":"A better balance of exploitation and exploration of solution space by the swarm is often mentioned as the key to a good performance of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Traditionally, the balance of exploitation and exploration ability of a PSO algorithm is usually shown empirically by the final result of the algorithm over some benchmark functions and not by the dynamic behavior of the swarm during the iteration process. In order to observe the dynamic behavior of the swarm in a PSO algorithm in details, two measurement indices, Dispersion Index and Velocity Index, are proposed In an empirical study, these indices are embedded in two PSO Algorithms and applied to six benchmark problems. The results of this study indicate that a good balance between exploration and exploitation does lead to a better PSO. This balance could be achieved by allowing enough time or iteration step for both exploration and exploitation processes to take place. Finally, the utilization of these indices to balance strategy for exploitation and exploration on the PSO is discussed It is also suggested that the velocity index can be used as a basis for controlling the length of iteration step of PSO algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424891","startPage":"3264","endPage":"3271","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424891.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersion and velocity indices for observing dynamic behavior of particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424891/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dispersion and velocity indices for observing dynamic behavior of particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424891/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889125","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersion and velocity indices for observing dynamic behavior of particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058164S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424893,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-hui Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, SUN Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-hui","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37392529300"},{"name":"Jing Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, SUN Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jing Xiao","id":"37309581300"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, SUN Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281461600"},{"name":"Wei-neng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, SUN Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Wei-neng Chen","id":"37834282900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424893","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of acceleration coefficients for particle swarm optimization based on clustering analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424893.pdf","startPage":"3276","endPage":"3282","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424893","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Acceleration","Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","convergence","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","acceleration coefficient","particle swarm optimization","clustering analysis","evolutionary computation","self-cognitive components","social-influence components","adaptive parameter adjustment","K-means algorithm","population distribution","search space","adaptive system","multidimensional mathematical functions","convergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424893","abstract":"Research into setting the values of the acceleration coefficients c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most significant and promising areas in evolutionary computation.

However, because of the large number of possible failure states involved in the power system, it is normally not viable to exhaustively enumerate and evaluate all the states which may contribute to system failure. Meanwhile, time-dependent sources such as wind turbine generators are being more significantly integrated into the traditional power grid for cleaner power generation. The intermittency of wind power sources further complicates the reliability evaluation process. In this paper, a binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is adopted to derive a set of meaningful system states, which significantly affects the adequacy indices of generation system including loss of load expectation (LOLE), loss of load frequency (LOLF), and expected energy not supplied (EENS). A numerical example is used to verify the applicability and validity of the proposed population-based intelligent search (PIS) based evaluation procedure. Especially, a comparative study in relation to the exact method and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is carried out.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424904/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889459","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424904/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reliability evaluation of power-generating systems including time-dependent sources based on binary particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability evaluation of power-generating systems including time-dependent sources based on binary particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077215S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424905,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, as iterative heuristic searching methods, they often suffer from difficulties in obtaining high quality solutions in an efficient manner. Since unnecessary resources used in computation iterations should be avoided, the determination of a proper termination condition for the algorithms is desirable. In this work, termination is cast as a decision-making process to end the algorithm. Specifically, the non-parametric sign- test is incorporated as a hypothetical test method such that a quantifiable termination in regard to specifiable decision-errors can be assured. Benchmark optimization problems are tackled using the PSO as an illustrative optimizer to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed termination condition.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Decision making","Convergence","Iterative algorithms","Mobile robots","Evolutionary computation","Educational institutions","Remotely operated vehicles","Vehicle driving","Birds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","decision-making approach","evolutionary computation algorithms","real-world product design","iterative heuristic searching methods","computation iterations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424905","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424905","startPage":"3353","endPage":"3360","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424905.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424905/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient particle swarm optimization: a termination condition based on the decision-making approach","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9889280","htmlLink":"/document/4424905/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient particle swarm optimization: a termination condition based on the decision-making approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424916,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuyuki Takahama","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Systems, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Tetsuyuki Takahama","id":"37087195965"},{"name":"Setsuko Sakai","affiliation":["Faculty of Commercial Sciences, Hiroshima Shudo University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Setsuko Sakai","id":"37087196034"},{"name":"Akira Hara","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Systems, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Akira Hara","id":"37087196758"},{"name":"Noriyuki Iwane","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Systems, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Noriyuki Iwane","id":"37087194492"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424916","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Robustness","Supervised learning","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Genetic algorithms","Learning systems","Genetic mutations","Testing","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structural learning","neural networks","estimation systems","supervised learning","fuzzy rules","genetic algorithm with degeneration","genetic damage","Gaussian mutation","inverse mapping","differential evolution with degeneration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424916","abstract":"Structural learning, in which the structure of estimation systems are optimized, has been actively studied in researches on supervised learning of neural networks and fuzzy rules.

Both heuristic and evolutionary algorithms are commonly used in real world. Heuristic algorithms converge rapidly but often be trapped in local minima and evolutionary algorithms own high exploration capacity but become time-consuming when handling large-scale systems.

One approach to extend the lifetime is to divide the deployed sensors into disjoint subsets of sensors, or sensor covers, such that each sensor cover can cover all targets and work by turns. The more sensor covers can be found, the longer sensor network lifetime can be prolonged. Finding the maximum number of sensor covers can be solved via transformation to the Disjoint Set Covers (DSC) problem, which has been proved to be NP-complete. For this optimization problem, existing heuristic algorithms either get unsatisfactory solutions in some cases or take exponential time complexity. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm to solve the DSC problem. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can get near-optimal solutions with polynomial computation time and can improve the performance of the most constrained-minimum constraining heuristic algorithm by 16% in solution quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective genetic algorithm to improve wireless sensor network lifetime for large-scale surveillance applications","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424930","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424930.pdf","startPage":"3531","endPage":"3538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An effective genetic algorithm to improve wireless sensor network lifetime for large-scale surveillance applications","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424930/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889604","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective genetic algorithm to improve wireless sensor network lifetime for large-scale surveillance applications","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142112S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4424935,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Such sequences should therefore have a large linear complexity and also a large k-error linear complexity. Efficient algorithms for computing the k-error linear complexity of a sequence over a finite field only exist for sequences of period equal to a power of the characteristic of the field. It is therefore useful to find a general and efficient algorithm to compute a good approximation of the k-error linear complexity. In this paper we investigate the design of a genetic algorithm to approximate the k-error linear complexity of a sequence. Our preliminary experiments show that the genetic algorithm approach is suitable to the problem and that a good scheme would use a medium sized population, an elitist type of selection, a special design of the two point random crossover and a standard random mutation. The algorithm outputs an approximative value of the k-error linear complexity which is on average only 19.5% higher than the exact value. This paper intends to be a proof of concept that the genetic algorithm technique is suitable for the problem in hand and future research will further refine the choice of parameters.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424935","startPage":"3569","endPage":"3576","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424935.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for computing the k-error linear complexity of cryptographic sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Cryptography","Galois fields","Genetic mutations","Random sequences","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms","Linear approximation","Linear feedback shift registers","Character generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","cryptography","genetic algorithms","probability","random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","k-error linear complexity","cryptographic sequence","pseudorandom sequence","finite field","random mutation","two point random crossover","probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for computing the k-error linear complexity of cryptographic sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424935/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889368","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for computing the k-error linear complexity of cryptographic sequences","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056871S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424937,"authors":[{"name":"Karin Zielinski","affiliation":["Intitute for Electromagnetic Theory and Microelectronics, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Karin","lastName":"Zielinski","id":"37686512700"},{"name":"Rainer Laur","affiliation":["Intitute for Electromagnetic Theory and Microelectronics, University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Laur","id":"37325325400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424937","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Evolutionary computation","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Design methodology","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","design of experiments","evolutionary computation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential evolution algorithm","multiobjective optimization","control parameter settings","convergence probability","convergence speed","design of experiments"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424937","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424937.pdf","startPage":"3585","endPage":"3592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential evolution with adaptive parameter setting for multi-objective optimization","abstract":"Control parameter settings influence the convergence probability and convergence speed of evolutionary algorithms but it is often not obvious how to choose them.

Several merit factors for comparing the outcomes of these algorithms have also been proposed. However, evaluating Pareto-surface sample sets is still considered an open problem, since the result of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is a collection of vectors forming a nondominated set, that can be viewed under rather different merit criteria. In this paper, we present a new performance metric: the Integrated Sphere Counting. This metric is motivated on two reasoning principles: (i) the Pareto-surface is an object that is to be described via sample sets, in a sense that is similar to the sampled function description in signal processing; and (ii) the resolution that is to be employed in the Pareto-surface sample set depends on the decision-making procedure resolution, instead of the surface structure itself. We test this metric with two benchmark problems: the 0/1 Knapsack Problem and ZDT number 6 test suite.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424942","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424942.pdf","startPage":"3625","endPage":"3630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A new performance metric for multiobjective optimization: the integrated sphere counting","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889164","htmlLink":"/document/4424942/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new performance metric for multiobjective optimization: the integrated sphere counting","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065933S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424951,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Graham","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Graham","id":"37684766800"},{"name":"Franz Oppacher","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Oppacher","id":"37282643800"},{"name":"Steffen Christensen","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Christensen","id":"37837330600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424951","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424951","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm complexity","evolve systems","dynamic fitness function","parsimony pressure","complex systems","gradualistic nature"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424951","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424951.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"3692","endPage":"3697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Irreducible complexity in a genetic algorithm","abstract":"There has been much news about the ability of evolution to evolve systems where function ceases with the removal of any of its multiple parts.

A simulation environment is also proposed by using scheduling techniques based on the use of genetic algorithms to select the most suitable process model.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424961","startPage":"3766","endPage":"3775","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424961.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating planning and scheduling based on genetic algorithms to an workflow system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Web services","Service oriented architecture","Computer architecture","Web and internet services","Business","Processor scheduling","Application software","Artificial intelligence","Process planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","planning","scheduling","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planning","scheduling","genetic algorithms","workflow system","automatic process model generation","Web Service domain","Web services composition","simulation environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Integrating planning and scheduling based on genetic algorithms to an workflow system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424961/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889263","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating planning and scheduling based on genetic algorithms to an workflow system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079571S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4424965,"authors":[{"name":"Shouichi Matsui","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Laboratory (SERL), Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Komae, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Shouichi Matsui","id":"37087657533"},{"name":"Seiji Yamada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Seiji Yamada","id":"37087349560"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424965","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Job shop scheduling","Biological cells","Decoding","Production","History","Algorithm design and analysis","Simulated annealing","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","job shop scheduling","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["empirical performance evaluation","parameter-free genetic algorithm","job shop scheduling problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424965","abstract":"The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is well known as one of the most difficult NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.

They reported that their algorithm performs well for typical benchmark problems, but the experiments were limited to a small number of problem instances.

The objective of JSSP in this research is to minimize the makespan. In this paper, we propose two Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approaches for solving JSSP. Firstly, we design a simple heuristic to reduce the completion time of jobs on the bottleneck machines that we call the reducing bottleneck technique (RBT). This heuristic was implemented in conjunction with a GA. Secondly; we propose to fill any possible gaps left in the simple GA solutions by the tasks that are scheduled later. We call this process the gap-utilization technique (GUT). With GUT, we also apply a swapping technique that deals only with the bottleneck job. We study 35 test problems with known solutions, using the existing GA and our proposed two algorithms. We obtain optimal solutions for 23 problems, and the solutions are very close for the rest.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424966","startPage":"3804","endPage":"3811","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424966.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified genetic algorithm for job-shop scheduling: A gap utilization technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","genetic algorithms","job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","job-shop scheduling","gap-utilization technique","combinatorial optimization problems","bottleneck machines","reducing bottleneck technique","swapping technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Job-Shop Scheduling","Makespan","Genetic Algorithm","Heuristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modified genetic algorithm for job-shop scheduling: A gap utilization technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424966/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889461","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified genetic algorithm for job-shop scheduling: A gap utilization technique","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083148S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4424967,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Physical Chemistry, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Calcutta, India"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37831651500"},{"name":"S.

The competition mechanism also indirectly helps DCPSO to overcome the fault-tolerance constraint in distributed computation.

The determination of optimal consensus sequences is NP-hard (Gusfield). We present two new algorithms and compare them to earlier, published methods of determining consensus sequences. The first, CONSENSIZE, is an application of the genetic algorithm scheme (GAS). The other is a simple steepest descent search, usually not very useful for NP-hard problems, but surprisingly successful for this application. We discuss both algorithms and experimentally compare their accuracy and efficiency with the simulated annealing, multiple alignment and center string approaches.

The significant enhancements allow the new MSOPS-II ranking process to be used as part of a general-purpose multi/many objective optimisation algorithm, requiring minimal initial configuration.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424985","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","startPage":"3944","endPage":"3951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MSOPS-II: A general-purpose Many-Objective optimiser","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MSOPS-II: A general-purpose Many-Objective optimiser","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424985/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889597","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4424985/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MSOPS-II: A general-purpose Many-Objective optimiser","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039463S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4424988,"authors":[{"name":"Hisao Ishibuchi","affiliation":["Department of Compute Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Hisao Ishibuchi","id":"37276592200"},{"name":"Noritaka Tsukamoto","affiliation":["Department of Compute Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Noritaka Tsukamoto","id":"37534876200"},{"name":"Yusuke Nojima","affiliation":["Department of Compute Science and Intelligent Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Yusuke Nojima","id":"37282893100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424988","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","iterative methods","search problems","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm","quality indicator","hypervolume measure","iterative approach","nondominated solution set","search problem"]}],"abstract":"An emerging trend in the design of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms is to directly optimize a quality indicator of non-dominated solution sets such as the hypervolume measure. Some algorithms have been proposed to search for a set of a pre-specified number of non-dominated solutions that maximizes the given quality indicator. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach to indicator-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization. The main feature of our approach is that only a single solution is obtained by its single run. Thus multiple runs are needed to find a solution set. In each run, our approach searches for a solution with the maximum contribution to the hypervolume of the solution set obtained by its previous runs. We discuss several issues related to the implementation of such an iterative approach.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424988","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424988.pdf","startPage":"3967","endPage":"3974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative approach to indicator-based multiobjective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424988/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative approach to indicator-based multiobjective optimization","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424988/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889480","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative approach to indicator-based multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071313S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4424989,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Grid-based archiving presents a compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Most grid-based archiving algorithms require apriori knowledge of the span of the Pareto front for pre-setting of the grid length or the associated parameter, grid number. Unfortunately the knowledge is often unavailable beforehand in practice. The quality of the attained non-dominated front can be very sensitive to the dimension of the grids. This paper presents a dynamic grid resizing strategy, capable of shrinking or expanding hyper grids as necessity dictates. Empirical study on two- and three-objective test functions demonstrates robust performance with respect to the initial grid sizes. Applied in the context of PAES, the adaptive archiving strategy performed well for initial grid sizes determined from a uniform random distribution. In comparison to AGA, the dynamic strategy presents improved non-dominated solutions in terms of proximity to the Pareto front and diversity for selected test problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889703","htmlLink":"/document/4424989/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic resizing for grid-based archiving in evolutionary multi objective optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic resizing for grid-based archiving in evolutionary multi objective optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111555S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4424990,"authors":[{"name":"Saku Kukkonen","affiliation":["The Department of Information Technology, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeeranta, Finland"],"lastName":"Saku Kukkonen","id":"37548817100"},{"name":"Jouni Lampinen","affiliation":["The Department of Information Technology, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeeranta, Finland"],"lastName":"Jouni Lampinen","id":"37330287700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4424990","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":710},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Hypercubes","Sorting","Genetic algorithms","Information technology","Random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ranking dominance","aggregation function","scalar fitness value","multiobjective optimization","Pareto-dominance relation","Pareto-front","diversity maintenance"]}],"abstract":"An alternative relation to Pareto-dominance is studied. The relation is based on ranking a set of solutions according to each separate objective and an aggregation function to calculate a scalar fitness value for each solution. The relation is called as ranking-dominance and it tries to tackle the curse of dimensionality commonly observed in multi-objective optimization. Ranking-dominance can be used to sort a set of solutions even for a large number of objectives when the Pareto-dominance relation cannot distinguish solutions from one another anymore. This permits the search to advance even with a large number of objectives. Experimental results indicate that in some cases the selection based on ranking-dominance is able to advance the search towards the Pareto-front better than the selection based on Pareto-dominance. However, in some cases it is also possible that the search does not proceed into direction of the Pareto-front because the ranking-dominance relation permits deterioration of individual objectives. The results also show that when the number of objectives increases, the selection based on just Pareto-dominance without diversity maintenance is able to advance the search better than with diversity maintenance. Therefore, diversity maintenance connives at difficulties solving problems with a high number of objectives.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4424990","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04424990.pdf","startPage":"3983","endPage":"3990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4424990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ranking-Dominance and Many-Objective Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4424990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424990/","displayDocTitle":"Ranking-Dominance and Many-Objective Optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889569","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424990/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ranking-Dominance and Many-Objective Optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10557S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4424992,"authors":[{"name":"Arya K.

The objective of optimization is to enhance lubrication within the mould, especially at higher casting speeds, and reduce the intensity of oscillation marks. The need to improve lubrication conditions is primarily addressed by making the mould oscillate on its longitudinal axis. It is known that non-sinusoidal oscillation, where the time for upward motion of the mould is longer than that of downward motion in an oscillation cycle, reduces depth of oscillation marks while providing better lubrication. In the present work, a Genetic Algorithm is applied to optimize the amplitude, frequency, and waveform of the oscillation of the continuous casting mould based on objective functions that maximize the lubrication, and minimize the depth of oscillation marks and the cycle peak friction. Optimization is performed within constraints imposed by machine limits. The objective function and constraints are extracted from an analysis of the physics of oscillation, lubrication and heat transfer within the continuous casting process. The application of the Genetic Algorithm within a unified framework encompassing all oscillation performance metrics and constraints is seen to generate an optimal parameter set that provides better performance than existing oscillation parameters supplied by Original Equipment Manufacturers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4424992/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889338","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4424992/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of continuous casting mould oscillation parameters in steel manufacturing process using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of continuous casting mould oscillation parameters in steel manufacturing process using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068563S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4424992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4424994,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Its computational power was revealed after the introduction of some quantum algorithms such as Grover's search algorithm. Many classical algorithms especially that deal with Error Correcting Codes are introduced to solve an exhaustive search problem. The quantum techniques promise an optimal search speed that is of special importance when the size of the searched domain is quite large. In this paper we devise the use of quantum search algorithm introduced by Grover to implement the viterbi algorithm (VA). Due to lack of resources and the nature of implementing quantum algorithms, only theoretical results are obtained. The use of quantum search algorithm showed that we can reduce the number of search computations exponentially. For example if the classical VA requires 262144 searching operations for a signalling length of 1024 intervals, the quantum algorithm will need only 512 searching operations when single search quantum viterbi algorithm (SSQVA) is used. And for the multi search quantum viterbi algorithm (MSQVA) it needs 16384 searching operations for the same signalling length.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425005","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425005.pdf","startPage":"4094","endPage":"4099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vieterbi decoder algorithm using quantum computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Vieterbi decoder algorithm using quantum computing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9889347","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425005/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vieterbi decoder algorithm using quantum computing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037907S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4425010,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Eskandari","affiliation":["Red Lambda Inc., Longwood, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Eskandari","id":"37649674100"},{"name":"Christopher D.

Hence, our successful hybrid genetic algorithms (HGA) proposed earlier for a square and cube lattice model is being extended in this paper for a 3D FCC model. Furthermore, twins (conformations having similarity with each other), in GA population have also been considered for removal from the search space for improving the effectiveness of GA The HGA combined with the twin removal (TR) strategy showed best performance when compared with the simple GA (SGA), SGA with TR, and HGA only versions.

Although this method has been successfully applied for various engineering structures for damage detection, it is unable to specify the effect of damage on structural properties. The direct indicator of the structural properties is the structural mechanical impedance which can be extracted from the PZT EM admittance signatures. To model the structural impedance, this paper presents a multiple-degrees-of-freedom system consisting of a number of one-degree-of-freedom elements with mass, spring and damper components. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are employed to search for the optimal solution of the unknown dynamic system parameters by minimizing an objective function. Experiment has been carried on a two-storey concrete frame subjected to base vibrations that simulate earthquake. A number of PZT transducers are regularly arrayed and bonded to the frame structure to acquire PZT EM admittance signatures. The changes of the structural parameters in the model system are quantified using GAs. The relation between the distance of the PZT transducer away from the damage and the changes of the structural parameters identified by the PZT transducer is studied.

Optimization methods based on genetic algorithms (GA) have recently been demonstrated to have the potential for overcoming the problems associated with gradient-based methods. The success of the GA depends, to a large extent, on the structural geometry representation scheme used. In this work, some enhancements are incorporated into the recently developed morphological geometric representation scheme coupled with a GA. Based on the morphology of living creatures, a geometric representation scheme had earlier been developed that works by specifying a skeleton which defines the underlying topology/connectivity of a structural continuum together with segments of material surrounding the skeleton. In this work, the flexibility to turn on or off parts of the skeleton is integrated into the scheme. This improves the variability of topological and shape characteristics in the evolutionary process and enhances the representation's versatility.

This paper describes a method of estimating fitness, and the reliability of that estimation, that can be used as an alternative to performing some true fitness calculations. The fitness estimation is always made, but, should the reliability of this fitness estimation drop below a user specified threshold, the estimate is discarded and a true fitness evaluation performed. Results are presented for three problems that show that the number of true fitness evaluations can be significantly reduced by this method without degrading the performance of PSO. Further the value used for the threshold, the only new parameter introduced, is shown not to be sensitive, at least on these test problems. Provided that the time to perform a true fitness evaluation is far longer than the time for the fitness and reliability calculations, a substantial amount of computing time can be saved while still achieving the same end result.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425028","startPage":"4266","endPage":"4272","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425028.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fitness estimation and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Performance evaluation","Computational efficiency","Life estimation","Information technology","Australia","Degradation","Testing","Parallel processing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fitness estimation","particle swarm optimisation algorithm","reliability estimation","true fitness calculations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fitness estimation and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425028/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889267","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fitness estimation and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039059S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4425030,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper deals with a novel real-world optimization problem, called the 'Item-location assignment problem', faced by a logistics company in Shenzhen, China. The objective of the company in this particular operation is to assign items to suitable locations such that the sum of the total traveling time of the workers required for all orders is minimized. We propose to use a stochastic search technique called fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms (FLGA) to solve this operational problem. In GA, a specially designed crossover operation, called a shift and uniform based multi-point (SUMP) crossover, and swap mutation are adopted. Furthermore, the role of fuzzy logic is to dynamically adjust the crossover and mutation rates after each ten consecutive generations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FLGA and make a comparison with the FLGA through simulations, several search methods, branch and bound, standard GA (i.e. without the guide of fuzzy logic), simulated annealing, and tabu search, are adopted. Results show that the FLGA outperforms the other search methods in the considered scenario.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425030","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425030.pdf","startPage":"4281","endPage":"4288","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms for the location assignment of items","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms for the location assignment of items","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9889168","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425030/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms for the location assignment of items","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110264S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4425038,"authors":[{"name":"Tezuka Masaru","affiliation":["Research and Development Section, Hitachi East Japan Solutions Limited, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Tezuka Masaru","id":"37087527818"},{"name":"Ito Yoichi","affiliation":["Financial Solution Division, Hitachi East Japan Solutions Limited, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Ito Yoichi","id":"37087527488"},{"name":"Munakata Satoshi","affiliation":["Research and Development Section, Hitachi East Japan Solutions Limited, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Munakata Satoshi","id":"37087526138"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4425038","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425038","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Indium tin oxide","Risk management","Humans","Design methodology","Companies","Research and development","Biological cells","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["banking","credit transactions","estimation theory","financial management","genetic algorithms","logistics","probability","risk management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","binomial logit","default probability estimation","credit risk management","financial institutes","credit administration","integer-coded GA","covariate optimization","Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425038","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425038.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"4344","endPage":"4349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm approach to design covariates of binomial logit model for estimation of default probability","abstract":"Credit risk management is one of the most important tasks of financial institutes. Default probability is the probability that a company will go into default, or be unable to fulfill an obligation, and it is a critical information for credit administration. Binomial logit model is widely used for default probability estimation. The formulas for computing covariates used in the model are designed by human experts in trial-and error way, based on their experience. In this paper, we propose a method to design covariates. Integer-coded GA is employed and a representation of the chromosome is proposed for the purpose of optimizing the covariate. The method optimizes the covariates using the GA and estimates the coefficient of binomial logit model using Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method. The method is tested on an actual data provided for evaluation by a bank.

To address the registration problem in some practical cases, the evolutionary algorithm based method can be explored. A method based on genertic algorithm, as well as the least squares method, are developed for sensor registration in different simulation scenarios and compared. Simulation results are analyzed to make clear the advantages and disadvantages of the methods.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425047","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425047.pdf","startPage":"4405","endPage":"4409","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the applications of the genetic algorithm to sensor registration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Research on the applications of the genetic algorithm to sensor registration","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9889277","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425047/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the applications of the genetic algorithm to sensor registration","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066009S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4425048,"authors":[{"name":"Glenn Sanders","affiliation":["Operations Support Squadron, Palmerston, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Glenn","lastName":"Sanders","id":"37840059200"},{"name":"Tapabrata Ray","affiliation":[" Australian Defence Force Academy, University of New South Wales, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Tapabrata","lastName":"Ray","id":"37276115400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4425048","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Path planning","Evolutionary computation","Aircraft","Vehicle dynamics","Navigation","Aerospace industry","Computational modeling","Fuels","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","genetic algorithms","microrobots","mobile robots","path planning","remotely operated vehicles","robot dynamics","space vehicles","stochastic processes","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal offline path planning","UAV","evolutionary algorithm","autonomous miniature fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles","path representation","aircraft dynamics","waypoint guidance method","commercial aviation industry","rigorous model validation","optimization algorithm","stochastic method","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Path planning is the process of generating a path between an initial location and a target location that has optimal performance against specific criteria. This paper addresses the problem of offline path planning as applied to autonomous miniature fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles (mini-UAVs). The path representation takes into account aircraft dynamics by incorporating the turn rates and velocities of the UAV and follows a waypoint guidance method that is adopted in commercial aviation industry. The aircraft dynamics model allows the computation of fuel use, throttle, and velocity at different time instants throughout the path. A rigorous model validation is carried out prior to using the model for optimal path identification. An evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize the path distance and threat exposure encountered by the UAV for a mission. The optimization algorithm is a stochastic, zero order, elitist method similar in many respects to nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) but includes explicit diversity maintaining mechanism in both the objective and variable space. A number of case studies are included to highlight the benefits offered by our approach.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425048","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425048.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","startPage":"4410","endPage":"4416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal offline path planning of a fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an evolutionary algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal offline path planning of a fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an evolutionary algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425048/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889158","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4425048/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal offline path planning of a fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an evolutionary algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057942S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4425054,"authors":[{"name":"Mahasak Ketcham","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Mahasak","lastName":"Ketcham","id":"37838692400"},{"name":"Sartid Vongprahip","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sartid","lastName":"Vongprahip","id":"37833135500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4425054","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425054","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Image quality","Signal processing","Noise robustness","Digital signal processing","Low pass filters","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","discrete wavelet transforms","search problems","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent audio watermarking","genetic algorithm","discrete wavelet transforms","watermark optimal intensity","adaptive tabu seacrh","watermarked image quality","optimal localization","digital signal processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425054","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425054.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"4454","endPage":"4461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm for intelligent audio watermaking using genetic algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, we present an innovative watermarking scheme based on genetic algorithms (GA) in the discrete wavelet transforms, we search for the optimal intensity of watermark by using the adaptive tabu search (ATS) is proposed.

Most of the work done in the area have used static route planning algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra\u2019s, Bellman-Ford algorithm etc. Although these algorithms are said to be optimum, they are not capable of dealing with certain real life scenarios. For example, most of these single objective optimizations fails to find the equally good solutions when there is more than one optimum (shortest distance path, least congested path). We believe that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based route planning algorithm proposed in this paper has the ability to tackle the above problems. In this paper, the proposed GA based route planning algorithm is successfully tested on the entire Singapore map with more than 10,000 nodes. Performance of the proposed GA is compared with an ant based path planning algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over ant based algorithm. Moreover, the proposed GA may be used as a basis for developing an intelligent route planning system.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425056","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425056.pdf","startPage":"4469","endPage":"4474","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm based route planner for large urban street networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm based route planner for large urban street networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9889446","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425056/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm based route planner for large urban street networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070584S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4425060,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Xiao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jianhua Xiao","id":"37087434728"},{"name":"Jin Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jin Xu","id":"37087197551"},{"name":"Zehui Shao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Zehui Shao","id":"37087490333"},{"name":"Congfeng Jiang","affiliation":["School of Hydropower and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Congfeng Jiang","id":"37087536414"},{"name":"Linqiang Pan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Linqiang Pan","id":"37088204001"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4425060","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425060","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Constraint optimization","Mathematical model","Testing","Operations research","Mathematics","Industrial engineering","Optimization methods","Quadratic programming","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","multiconstrained function optimization","KS function","agglomeration features"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425060","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425060.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"4497","endPage":"4501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for solving multi-constrained function optimization problems based on KS function","abstract":"In this paper, a new genetic algorithm for solving multi-constrained optimization problems based on KS function is proposed.

In other words, a solution that has been visited before may be revisited. The fitness of the solution has to be evaluated each time. Since fitness evaluation is the most computationally intensive process in the execution of the GA, revisits should be minimized or eliminated. In this paper, a novel dynamic binary partitioning tree archive is proposed to eliminate all revisits. It works as follows: When the GA generates a solution, the tree is accessed. A leaf node is appended to the tree if the solution has not been visited before and so has no record in the tree. Otherwise, a search is initiated from the leaf node that is the duplicate to the solution to find the nearest neighbor solution in the search space that is not visited. During this process, whole sub-trees may be pruned if all the leaf nodes it contains are visited. The search naturally implements a self adaptive mutation mechanism. Hence the GA requires no other mutation parameter or mutation scheme. Experimental results reveal that this new GA is superior in performance compared with the standard GA with revisits, and the tree archive is not memory intensive.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425072","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425072.pdf","startPage":"4583","endPage":"4590","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A non-revisiting Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A non-revisiting Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9889203","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425072/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A non-revisiting Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05122S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4425073,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Graham","affiliation":["Graduate student,School of Computer Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Graham","id":"37684766800"},{"name":"Franz Oppacher","affiliation":["Professor,School of Computer Science, Carleton University, Canada"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Oppacher","id":"37282643800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4425073","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","genetic encoding","genotype-phenotype mapping","niche fitness function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425073","abstract":"In this paper we present a simple genetic algorithm consisting of a number of small niches, each with a different fitness function.

The niche fitness functions have been devised so as to demonstrate the gradual evolution of a population via multiple exaptation events where migrants seed, at each step, a new niche, adapt, and then spread to another in a predictable sequence. Such exaptation events take advantage of \"hidden\" relationships between fitness functions and allow evolving populations to explore regions of phenotype space that are otherwise inaccessible.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425073","startPage":"4591","endPage":"4598","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425073.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple-function toy model of exaptation in a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425073/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multiple-function toy model of exaptation in a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425073/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889389","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple-function toy model of exaptation in a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050001S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4425075,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Hua Gu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jun-Hua","lastName":"Gu","id":"37334671400"},{"name":"Na-Na Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Na-Na","lastName":"Li","id":"37310414300"},{"name":"Qing Tan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Tan","id":"37826414800"},{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","id":"37670889400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4425075","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425075","abstract":"The insufficiency of local search and slow convergence in later generations are two main disadvantages of niche genetic algorithm (NGA).

This new method is used in Shubert function optimization and experimental results show its superiority compared with GA and NGA.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425075","startPage":"4606","endPage":"4609","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel niche genetic algorithm with local search ability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["niche genetic algorithm","local search ability","crossover operator","mutation operator","Shubert function optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A novel niche genetic algorithm with local search ability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425075/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9889209","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel niche genetic algorithm with local search ability","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049405S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4425080,"authors":[{"name":"Maury M.

This work proposes an adaptive evolutionary algorithm to control the population diversity based on a diversity function. The evolutionary process searches for the optimum while the diversity is controlled to track the diversity function. To control the population diversity, the proposed method creates a selection mechanism to adjust the fitnesses of a part of the population based on a fitness penalty. The proposed adaptive method uses the model-reference adaptive system as the control strategy to adjust the fitness penalty parameter. The proposed method is called diversity-reference adaptive control (DRAC). The performance of DRAC method was evaluated for multimodal and dynamic test functions. The results show that DRAC method often reached the optimum area, following environment changes, faster than SGA.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425080","startPage":"4639","endPage":"4645","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425080.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-based model reference for genetic algorithms in dynamic environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425080/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Diversity-based model reference for genetic algorithms in dynamic environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425080/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889353","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-based model reference for genetic algorithms in dynamic environment","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064485S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4425081,"authors":[{"name":"X.

First, an indirect field-oriented mechanism for a LIM drive is introduced to preserve the decoupling control characteristic. Then, the concept of toal sliding-mode control (TSC) is incorporated into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form an on-line TSPSOC framework for preserving the robust control characteristics and reducing the chattering control phenomena of TSC. Moreover, an adaptive inertial weight is devised to accelerate the searching speed effectively. In this control scheme, a PSO control system is utilized to be the major controller, and the stability can be indirectly ensured by the concept of TSC without strict constraint and detailed system knowledge. Numerical simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme for the tracking of periodic reference trajectories. In addition, the superiority of the proposed TSPSOC scheme is indicated in comparison with the TSC, Petri fuzzy-neural-network control (PENNC), and traditional fuzzy-neural-network control (TFNNC) systems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2007.4425092","startPage":"4729","endPage":"4734","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2007.4425092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424446","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4424445/4424446/04425092.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total sliding-model-based particle swarm optimization control design for linear induction motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425092/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Total sliding-model-based particle swarm optimization control design for linear induction motor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425092/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9889284","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total sliding-model-based particle swarm optimization control design for linear induction motor","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232007-00646.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074127S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4424445","isNumber":"4424446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4424445","xplore-issue":"4424446","articleId":"4425092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4425095,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Hui Wang","id":"37310560000"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan"],"lastName":"Hui Li","id":"37539767000"},{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Yong Liu","id":"37279417800"},{"name":"Changhe Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Changhe Li","id":"37536361900"},{"name":"Sanyou Zeng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Sanyou Zeng","id":"37604847300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1339-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1340-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4425095","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":848},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Evolutionary computation","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opposition-based particle swarm optimization","opposition-based learning","dynamic Cauchy mutation"]}],"abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown its fast search speed in many complicated optimization and search problems.

In this study, we introduce and discuss multivariable encoding and decoding mechanisms (referred altogether as a reconstruction problem) expressed in the language of fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations. The underlying performance index associated with the problem helps quantify a reconstruction error that arises when transforming a numeric datum through fuzzy sets (relations) and then reconstructing it into an original numeric format. The clustering platform considered in this study concerns the well-known algorithm of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). The main design aspects deal with the relationships between the number of clusters versus the reconstruction properties and the resulting reconstruction error. The impact of the fuzzification coefficient on the reconstruction quality is investigated. This finding is of interest, given the fact that predominantly all applications involving FCM use the value of the fuzzification coefficient equal to 2. In light of the completed experiments, we demonstrate that this selection may not be experimentally legitimate. We also carry out a comparative analysis of the reconstruction properties of the Boolean decoding that is induced by the fuzzy partition. Experimental investigations involve selected machine learning data. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.913809","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4463931/04425259.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.913809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Development of Fuzzy Encoding and Decoding Through Fuzzy Clustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Development of Fuzzy Encoding and Decoding Through Fuzzy Clustering","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918482","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4425259/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Development of Fuzzy Encoding and Decoding Through Fuzzy Clustering","sourcePdf":"57tim04-pedrycz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077377S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4463931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4463931","articleId":"4425259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4425260,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Woong Choi","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA","The Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ji-Woong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37336479200"},{"name":"Soohee Han","affiliation":["School for Creative Engineering Design, Generation Mechanical and Aerospace Systems, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soohee","lastName":"Han","id":"37278480300"},{"name":"John M.

These detections are then processed by a distributed site-wide tracking system. The detectors themselves are based on boosted user-defined exemplars, which capture both appearance and shape information. The detectors take integral images of both intensity and Sobel responses as input. This data representation enables efficient processing without relying on background subtraction or other motion cues. View-specific person detectors are constructed by iteratively presenting the boosting algorithm with training data associated with each individual camera. These detections are then transmitted from a distributed set of tracking clients to a server, which maintains a set of site-wide target tracks. Automatic calibration methods allow for tracking to be performed in a ground plane representation, which enables effective camera hand-off. Factors such as network latencies and scalability will be discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425286","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425265/4425266/04425286.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"View adaptive detection and distributed site wide tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"View adaptive detection and distributed site wide tracking","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425286/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9860271","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425286/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"View adaptive detection and distributed site wide tracking","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046262S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425265","isNumber":"4425266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425265","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4425266","articleId":"4425286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4425302,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This approach is especially useful in those applications that do not necessarily require the exact identification of the events, but need only the detection of anomalies that should be reported to a human operator (e.g. video surveillance or traffic monitoring applications). In this paper we propose a trajectory analysis method based on Support Vector Machines; the SVM model is trained on a given set of trajectories and can subsequently detect trajectories substantially differing from the training ones. Particular emphasis is placed on a novel method for estimating the parameter v, since it heavily influences the performances of the system but cannot be easily estimated a-priori. Experimental results are given both on synthetic and real-world data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425265/4425266/04425302.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous trajectory detection using support vector machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Event detection","Hidden Markov models","Video sequences","Humans","Video surveillance","Monitoring","Parameter estimation","Time series analysis","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image sequences","support vector machines","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous trajectory detection","support vector machines","video sequences","automatic pattern modelling","trajectory analysis","computer vision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous trajectory detection using support vector machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425302/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9860276","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous trajectory detection using support vector machines","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032008-00036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085415S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425265","isNumber":"4425266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425265","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4425266","articleId":"4425302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":4425316,"authors":[{"name":"Fatih Porikli","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Porikli","id":"37283409500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1695-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1696-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4425316","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Vehicle detection","Cameras","Video surveillance","Bayesian methods","Motion estimation","Statistics","Pixel","Vehicles","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Gaussian processes","image motion analysis","image segmentation","object detection","road vehicles","statistical analysis","traffic engineering computing","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","illegally parked vehicle detection","single static camera video surveillance","Gaussian mixture model","online Bayesian update","motion statistics","temporarily static region","parallel processing architecture","image segmentation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425316","abstract":"This paper presents an abandoned item and illegally parked vehicle detection method for single static camera video surveillance applications. By processing the input video at different frame rates, two backgrounds are constructed; one for short-term and another for long-term. Each of these backgrounds is defined as a mixture of Gaussian models, which are adapted using online Bayesian update. Two binary foreground maps are estimated by comparing the current frame with the backgrounds, and motion statistics are aggregated in a likelihood image by applying a set of heuristics to the foreground maps. Likelihood image is then used to differentiate between the pixels that belong to moving objects, temporarily static regions and scene background. Depending on the application, the temporary static regions indicate abandoned items, illegally parked vehicles, objects removed from the scene, etc. The presented pixel-wise method does not require object tracking, thus its performance is not upper-bounded to error prone detection and correspondence tasks that usually fail for crowded scenes. It accurately segments objects even if they are fully occluded. It can also be effectively implemented on a parallel processing architecture.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425316","startPage":"236","endPage":"241","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425265/4425266/04425316.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of temporarily static regions by processing video at different frame rates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Detection of temporarily static regions by processing video at different frame rates","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425316/","accessionNumber":"9824566","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425316/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of temporarily static regions by processing video at different frame rates","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032008-00050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048633S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425265","isNumber":"4425266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425265","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4425266","articleId":"4425316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4425326,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, the use of an array of pyroelectric sensors can lead to extraction of more features such as direction of movements, speed, number of people and other characteristics. In this work a low-cost pyroelectric infrared sensor based wireless network is set up to be used for tracking people motion. A novel technique is proposed to distinguish the direction of movement and the number of people passing. The approach has low computational requirements, therefore it is well-suited to limited-resources devices such as wireless nodes.

In addition, many surveillance systems are frequently left unattended. Because of these reasons, automated analysis of the live video feed and automatic detection of suspicious activity have recently gained importance. To prevent capture of their images, criminals resort to several techniques such as deliberately obscuring the camera view, covering the lens with a foreign object, spraying or de-focusing the camera lens.

The solution that we propose is based on the combination of two techniques. A blind source separation (BSS) method known as TRINICON [5] is applied to the signals acquired by the microphone arrays. The TRINICON de-mixing filters are used to obtain the Time Differences of Arrival (TDOAs), which are related to the source location through a nonlinear function. A particle filter is then applied in order to localize the sources. Particles move according to a swarm-like dynamics, which significatively reduces the number of particles involved with respect to traditional particle filter. We discuss results for the case of two sources and four microphone pairs. In addition, we propose a method, based on detecting source inactivity, which overcomes the ambiguities that intrinsically arise when only two microphone pairs are used. Experimental results demonstrate that the average localization error on a variety of pseudo-random trajectories is around 40 cm when the T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">60</sub>\n reverberation time is 0.6s.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425373","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425265/4425266/04425373.pdf","startPage":"567","endPage":"572","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking of two acoustic sources in reverberant environments using a particle swarm optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Tracking of two acoustic sources in reverberant environments using a particle swarm optimizer","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9824608","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425373/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking of two acoustic sources in reverberant environments using a particle swarm optimizer","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032008-00107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042843S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425265","isNumber":"4425266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425265","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4425266","articleId":"4425373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4425377,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Recently, the constant impedance, constant current, and constant power load in combination with the induction motor load have been widely used as the composite load model, whose parameters are all identified from the field measurements in measurement-based load modeling practices so far. However, there is virtually no research conducted on whether all these parameters could really be identified. This paper investigates the possibility on reducing the number of composite load model parameters to be identified from field measurements. This paper first shows that direct application of the IEEE load motor parameters in the composite load model may be inadequate on describing the load dynamics over different operating status. Then the perturbation method is used to derive the trajectory sensitivities of the equivalent motor parameters, based on which the reduction on the identified parameters of the composite load model is presented. Two cases of measurement-based load modeling in North China and Northeast China are studied to illustrate the validity of the reduction method. It is shown that the reduction does not lose the model's capability on describing the load dynamics. The reduction on the number of identified parameters not only provides a possible way to solve the multi-valued load model problem based on the current practices on measurement-based load modeling, but it also facilitates building of the load model with more components included in it. Meanwhile, reducing the identified parameters reduces the identification time; thus, the proposed strategy significantly enhances the efficiency of the load modeling work.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4435940/04425382.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"83","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.913206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.913206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Identified Parameters of Measurement-Based Composite Load Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Power system modeling","Power measurement","Power system simulation","Current measurement","Control system synthesis","Induction motors","Impedance measurement","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","power system control","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement-based composite load model","power system simulation","power system control","constant impedance","constant current","constant power load","induction motor load","North China","Northeast China","power system stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Composite load model","field measurements","power system stability","trajectory sensitivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Identified Parameters of Measurement-Based Composite Load Model","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4425382/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748244","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Identified Parameters of Measurement-Based Composite Load Model","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs01-ma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096946S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4435940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"4435940","articleId":"4425382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4425453,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In the dynamic power consumption of the conventional FPGAs, the power consumed by the switch blocks and clock distribution is dominant since FPGAs have complex switch blocks and the large number of registers for high programmability. To reduce the power consumption of switch blocks and clock distribution, asynchronous bit-serial architecture is proposed. To ensure the correct operation independent of data-path lengths, we use the level-encoded dual-rail encoding and propose its area-efficient implementation. The proposed field-programmable VLSI is implemented in a 90 nm CMOS technology. The delay and the power consumption of the proposed FPVLSI are respectively 61% and 58% of those of 4-phase dual-rail encoding which is the most common encoding in delay sensitive encoding.","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2007.4425710","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425676/4425677/04425710.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2007.4425710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Field-programmable VLSI based on an asynchronous bit-serial architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425710/","displayDocTitle":"A Field-programmable VLSI based on an asynchronous bit-serial architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9812693","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425710/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Field-programmable VLSI based on an asynchronous bit-serial architecture","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032008-00033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041692S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425676","isNumber":"4425677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425676","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4425677","articleId":"4425710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4425711,"authors":[{"name":"Hideharu Amano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Hideharu Amano","id":"37280731600"},{"name":"Yohei Hasegawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Yohei Hasegawa","id":"37272576200"},{"name":"Satoshi Tsutsumi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Satoshi Tsutsumi","id":"37285652300"},{"name":"Takuro Nakamura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Takuro Nakamura","id":"37291536300"},{"name":"Takashi Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Takashi Nishimura","id":"37287475500"},{"name":"Vasutan Tanbunheng","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Vasutan Tanbunheng","id":"37829636200"},{"name":"Aepu Parimala","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Aepu Parimala","id":"37063246200"},{"name":"Toru Sano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Toru Sano","id":"37399983100"},{"name":"Masaru Kato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Masaru Kato","id":"37396965500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1359-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1360-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4425711","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":230},"abstract":"Coarse grained dynamically reconfigurable processor arrays (DRPAs) have been received an attention as a flexible and efficient off-loading engine in system-on-chips (SoCs). Evaluation results in recent researches revealed that the parameters of optimal processor array structure: granularity, functions, array size, context size and interconnection flexibility, are completely different for each application. That is, DRPAs should be configurable for target SoCs and applications. MuCCRA is a project for developing a DRPA generator which can generate RTL model, testing environment and programming environment for various types of DRPAs just by selecting the specific parameters. Here, two prototype chips MuCCRA-1 and MuCCRA-2 developed in the project are introduced and evaluated. MuCCRA-1 was implemented with Rohm's 0.18 mum CMOS process mainly for multi-media applications, while MuCCRA-2 with ASPLA's 90 nm CMOS process was designed focusing on area optimization used as a cost-effective IP in multi-core SoCs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits

The rectifier utilizes self Vth cancellation (SVC) scheme in which threshold voltage of MOSFETs is cancelled by applying gate bias voltage generated by output voltage of the rectifier itself. Very simple circuit configuration and no power dissipation feature of the scheme enable excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) especially in small RF input power conditions. At higher RF input power conditions, PCE of the rectifier automatically decreases. This is the built-in self-power-regulation function. Proposed SVC CMOS rectifier has been fabricated with 0.35 mum CMOS process and the measured performance has been compared with other types of rectifiers. The SVC CMOS rectifier achieves 29% PCE at -9.9 dBm RF input power condition.

Electromagnetic interference from power/signal lines and to SRAM was simulated and measured. Interference from power lines for mobile applications (line and space) is smaller than that for high-performance applications (mesh type). Interference from signal lines requires only 9% of additional transmit power even in the worst case of logic circuits. In typical operation range, interference to SRAM is ignorable. Only when supply voltage is much lower than typical range, the bit-line noise from the inductive-coupling link influences SRAM operation. Interference to SRAM is small compared with other influences such as device variations and soft errors.","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2007.4425749","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425676/4425677/04425749.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2007.4425749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference from power/signal lines and to SRAM circuits in 65nm CMOS inductive-coupling link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Interference from power/signal lines and to SRAM circuits in 65nm CMOS inductive-coupling link","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425749/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9812631","conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference from power/signal lines and to SRAM circuits in 65nm CMOS inductive-coupling link","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032008-00072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098355S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425676","isNumber":"4425677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425676","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4425677","articleId":"4425749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4425750,"authors":[{"name":"Shiho Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Shiho Kim","id":"37087381197"},{"name":"Jung-Hyun Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung-Hyun Cho","id":"37087376797"},{"name":"Hyun-Sik Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyun-Sik Kim","id":"37086997048"},{"name":"Haksoo Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Haksoo Kim","id":"37087485416"},{"name":"Hee-Bok Kang","affiliation":["Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hee-Bok Kang","id":"37087195112"},{"name":"Suk-Kyung Hong","affiliation":["Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suk-Kyung Hong","id":"37087484599"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1359-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1360-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4425750","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":898},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425750","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Transponders","Random access memory","Ferroelectric films","Nonvolatile memory","Temperature sensors","Batteries","Protocols","Passive RFID tags","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric storage","protocols","radiofrequency identification","random-access storage","temperature sensors","thin film devices","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive UHF RFID transponder","FeRAM","temperature sensor","semi-active UHF RFID transponder chip","EPC Gen 2 protocol","passive RFID tag","battery power","re-writeable nonvolatile memory bank","EPC memory bank","thin film battery"]}],"abstract":"A fully integrated passive and battery powered semi-active UHF RFID transponder chip supporting EPC Gen 2 protocol is presented.

The shared memory array control scheme is based on direct addressing mode to achieve compatibility with normal SDRAM interface together with fast data transfer speed between two channels.","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2007.4425766","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425676/4425677/04425766.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2007.4425766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 512 mb 2-channel mobile DRAM (oneDRAM\u2122) with shared memory array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425766/","displayDocTitle":"A 512 mb 2-channel mobile DRAM (oneDRAM\u2122) with shared memory array","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425766/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9812650","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 512 mb 2-channel mobile DRAM (oneDRAM\u2122) with shared memory array","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032008-00089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081693S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425676","isNumber":"4425677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425676","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4425677","articleId":"4425766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4425767,"authors":[{"name":"Myounggon Kang","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Team, Semiconductor Research & Development Center,  Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myounggon Kang","id":"37552906300"},{"name":"Ki-Whan Song","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Team, Semiconductor Research & Development Center,  Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Whan Song","id":"37271867900"},{"name":"Hoeju Chung","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Team, Semiconductor Research & Development Center,  Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoeju Chung","id":"37278759400"},{"name":"Jinyoung Kim","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Team, Semiconductor Research & Development Center,  Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jinyoung Kim","id":"38185715200"},{"name":"Yeong-Taek Lee","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Team, Semiconductor Research & Development Center,  Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yeong-Taek Lee","id":"37579195400"},{"name":"Changhyun Kim","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Team, Semiconductor Research & Development Center,  Memory Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Hwaseong, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Changhyun Kim","id":"37279783900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1359-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1360-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4425767","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharge","Protection","Bandwidth","Thyristors","Capacitance","Communication system signaling","Low voltage","Packaging","Earth Observing System","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","electrostatic discharge","thyristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SCR-based ESD protection","high bandwidth DRAM","modified silicon controlled rectifier","low voltage triggering","input capacitance reduction","severe package level EOS test conditions","DDR3-1066 specification","SPICE simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCR","ESD","GGNMOS","input capacitance","high speed","DRAM"]}],"abstract":"A modified SCR (silicon controlled rectifier) is proposed as an ESD protection for high speed signaling systems.

The ECC circuit is optimized with respect to the increase in the chip area and the access-time penalty. The ratio of ECC area increase compared with the conventional mobile DRAM is 15%, and the fast comparing circuits of built-in Hamming code technique check 12 cell data simultaneously and satisfy the specification of 400Mbps DDR SDRAM. The self refresh period at standby state shows about 6 times increase reducing the self refresh current to be less than 100uA at 85degC. The newly adopted DCCS in the ECC, which is resistant from the clustered failures, and the concurrent row redundancy produce a synergistic fault-tolerance effect.

In particular, block transmission techniques with zero padding (ZP) and cyclic prefix (CP) are becoming attractive procedures for their ability to eliminate both intersymbol interference (ISI) and interblock interference (IBI). In this paper, we present a unified approach to blind-channel estimation and interference suppression for block transmission using ZP or CP in both single-carrier (SC) and multicarrier (MC) systems. Our approach uses a generalized multichannel minimum variance principle to design an equalizing filterbank. The channel estimate is then obtained from an asymptotically tight lower bound of the filterbank output power. Through an asymptotic analysis of the subspace of the received signal, we determine an upper bound for the number of interfering tones that can be handled by the proposed schemes. As a performance measure, we derive an unconditional Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) that, similar to the proposed blind channel estimators, does not assume knowledge of the transmitted information symbols. Numerical examples show that the proposed schemes approach the CRB as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases. Additionally, they exhibit low sensitivity to unknown narrowband interference and favorably compare with subspace blind-channel estimators.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.915497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04425795.pdf","endPage":"2791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind-Channel Estimation and Interference Suppression for Single-Carrier and Multicarrier Block Transmission Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.915497","startPage":"2779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind-Channel Estimation and Interference Suppression for Single-Carrier and Multicarrier Block Transmission Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425795/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10222395","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4425795/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind-Channel Estimation and Interference Suppression for Single-Carrier and Multicarrier Block Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-amleh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070941S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4425795","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4425796,"authors":[{"name":"Mamadou Ba\u00cflo Camara","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Systems, University of Franche-Comt\u00e9, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Mamadou Ba\u00cflo","lastName":"Camara","id":"37409476100"},{"name":"Hamid Gualous","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Systems, University of Franche-Comt\u00e9, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Gualous","id":"37271233400"},{"name":"Frederic Gustin","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Systems, University of Franche-Comt\u00e9, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Gustin","id":"37274516000"},{"name":"Alain Berthon","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Systems, University of Franche-Comt\u00e9, Belfort, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Berthon","id":"37274514600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4425796","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":272,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5220},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425796","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","Supercapacitors","Battery powered vehicles","Voltage","Electronic equipment testing","Alternators","System testing","Collaboration","Fluctuations","Rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","DC-DC power convertors","hybrid electric vehicles","road vehicles","secondary cells","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC/DC converters control","share energy","supercapacitors","hybrid electric vehicles","lead-acid batteries","electric power storage","electric power management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buck\u2013boost converter","control strategy","energy management","energy storage","hybrid vehicle","multisource system","supercapacitors"]},{"kwd":["Buck-Boost converter","control strategy","energy management","energy storage","hybrid vehicle","multi source system","supercapacitors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.915491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04425796.pdf","startPage":"2721","endPage":"2735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.915491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and New Control of DC/DC Converters to Share Energy Between Supercapacitors and Batteries in Hybrid Vehicles","abstract":"In this paper, the authors propose the supercapacitor integration strategy in a hybrid series vehicle. The designed vehicle is an experimental test bench developed at the laboratory of electrical engineering and systems (L2ES) in collaboration with the research in electrical engineering and electronics center of Belfort (CREEBEL). This test bench currently has two diesel motors (each connected to one alternator) and lead-acid batteries with a voltage rating of 540 V and a fluctuation margin between +12% and -20% of the rated voltage. The alternators are connected to the dc link by rectifiers. An original strategy of the supercapacitor integration in this vehicle with their control is presented to find a better compromise between the dimensions of the embarked devices, the share energy efficiency, the dynamics of the supply, and the electric power storage. The supercapacitor packs are made up of two modules of 108 cells each and present a maximum voltage of 270 V. The main objective is to provide a peak power of 216 kW over 20 s from supercapacitors to the dc link. Various topologies of dc/dc converters are presented with effective methodologies of electric power management in the hybrid vehicle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10222402","volume":"57","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and New Control of DC/DC Converters to Share Energy Between Supercapacitors and Batteries in Hybrid Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and New Control of DC/DC Converters to Share Energy Between Supercapacitors and Batteries in Hybrid Vehicles","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-camara.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034763S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"272","articleId":"4425796","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4425797,"authors":[{"name":"Hakan Caner","affiliation":["Aselsan, Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4626110/4425797/4425797-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hakan Caner received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","He is a Test Engineer with Aselsan Inc., Ankara.

This region is segmented into disjoint characters for the character recognition phase, where the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is used to identify the characters. The system is portable and relatively faster than computer-based recognition systems. The robustness of the system has been tested with a large database acquired from parking lots and a highway. The memory requirements are uniquely designed to be extremely low, which enables usage of smaller FPGAs. The resulting hardware is suitable for applications where cost, compactness, and efficiency are system design constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04425797.pdf","startPage":"2675","endPage":"2683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.915524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.915524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Embedded Neural-Network-Based License Plate Recognition System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Licenses","Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Gabor filters","Labeling","Character recognition","Neural networks","Portable computers","Robustness","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Gabor filters","optical character recognition","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded neural-network","license plate recognition system","video processing methodology","field-programmable gate array","Gabor filter","connected component labeling algorithm","self-organizing map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Character recognition","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","neural network applications","neural networks","self-organizing maps (SOMs)"]},{"kwd":["Character recognition","Self-organizing maps","Neural networks","Neural networks applications","Field Programmable Gate Arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Embedded Neural-Network-Based License Plate Recognition System","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4425797/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208418","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Embedded Neural-Network-Based License Plate Recognition System","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-caner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068612S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4425797","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4425798,"authors":[{"name":"Parthapratim De","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Parthapratim","lastName":"De","id":"37287055200"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4425798","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1205},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Face detection","Statistics","Signal to noise ratio","Shadow mapping","Receiving antennas","Matrix decomposition","Detection algorithms","Multipath channels","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","low signal-to-noise ratio region","multipath","shadowing","multiple receive antennas","linear prediction","QR decomposition","received signal matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind detection algorithm","cognitive radio","QR decomposition","spectrum sensing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.915520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","endPage":"2842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04425798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.915520","startPage":"2834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425798","abstract":"In a cognitive radio network, the spectrum that is allocated to primary users can be used by secondary users if the spectrum is not being used by the primary user at the current time and location. The only consideration is that the secondary users have to vacate the channel within a certain amount of time whenever the primary user becomes active. Thus, the cognitive radio faces the difficult challenge of detecting (sensing) the presence of the primary user, particularly in a low signal-to-noise ratio region, since the signal of the primary user might be severely attenuated due to multipath and shadowing before reaching the secondary user. In this paper, a blind sensing algorithm is derived, which is based on oversampling the received signal or by employing multiple receive antennas. The proposed method combines linear prediction and QR decomposition of the received signal matrix. Then, two signal statistics are computed from the oversampled received signal. The ratio of these two statistics is an indicator of the presence/absence of the primary signal in the received signal. Our algorithm does not require the knowledge of the signal or of the noise power. Moreover, the proposed detection algorithm in this paper is blind in the sense that it does not require information about the multipath channel distortions the primary signal has undergone on its way to reaching the secondary user. Simulations have shown that our algorithm performs much better than the commonly used energy detector, which usually suffers from the noise uncertainty problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10222405","displayDocTitle":"Blind Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-de.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041916S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"50","articleId":"4425798","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4425799,"authors":[{"name":"Jaesang Ham","affiliation":["The Communication Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaesang","lastName":"Ham","id":"37302181800"},{"name":"Kyeongyeon Kim","affiliation":["The Communication Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeongyeon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292681700"},{"name":"Sangheon Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, The Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangheon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37558343400"},{"name":"Chungyong Lee","affiliation":["The Communication Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chungyong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280420600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4425799","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper proposes new algorithms to improve the bit error rate (BER) and data rate of link-adaptive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) receivers in a multiuser environment.

This problem is encountered due to the presence of local scatterers in the vicinity of a transmitter or due to signals propagating through a random inhomogeneous medium. Since the spatial covariance matrix has full rank for an incoherently distributed source, the performance of most high-resolution DOA estimation algorithms conceived under coherently distributed sources, as well as point source models, degrades when scattering is present. In addition, several DOA estimation techniques devised under a distributed source model require a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the conventional beamforming approach, which estimates the nominal DOA from a spatial maximum peak of the output power. The proposed method is computationally more attractive than the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, although the performance degrades in comparison with the ML estimator, whose asymptotic performance is equivalent to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We derive and compare the asymptotic performances of the proposed method and the redundancy-averaged covariance matching (RACM) method in the single-source case. The simulation results illustrate that the asymptotic performance of the proposed method is better than that of the RACM method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4425804/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208422","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Method for the Direction-of-Arrival Estimation of Incoherently Distributed Sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for the Direction-of-Arrival Estimation of Incoherently Distributed Sources","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-jlee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076495S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4425804","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4425807,"authors":[{"name":"Taiwen Tang","affiliation":["Chengdu Goldtel Electronic Technology Company, Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4626110/4425807/4425807-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taiwen Tang (S'04) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Colorado State University, Fort Collins, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2006.","From August 2001 to July 2003, he was a member of the Radar and Communications Group, Colorado State University, working on remote sensing with dual polarized meteorological radar systems.

We compensate for the effects of the frequency offsets and the propagation delays with these estimated parameters and then use the proposed direct training-based equalizer design algorithm to obtain the equalizer coefficients.

The structure of the MD-DLL is similar to that of a traditional delay lock loop (T-DLL), aside from the fact that the despreading signals in T-DLL are replaced by a linear combination of all the users' code sequences with various weightings and timing offsets. The basic principles of MD-DLL are given as follows: 1) to use the decorrelating technique of a multiuser detector to remove the multiple-access interference at the on-time code position instant and 2) to choose a proper timing offset for the code sequences to reduce the weighting imbalance between the two arms of the tracking loop and suppress noise enhancement. The proposed MD-DLL scheme solves the tracking bias problems in a decorrelated delay lock loop under a low-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) condition. Computer simulations based on Gold code sequences are used to verify the findings. It is shown that MD-DLL achieves a better and stable S-curve with negligible tracking bias, better rms tracking error and mean-time-to-lose-lock performance under high-SNR conditions, and stronger near-far resistance than T-DLL.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.915516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04425809.pdf","startPage":"3293","endPage":"3299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.915516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Decorrelated Delay Lock Loop for Synchronous DS-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425809/","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Decorrelated Delay Lock Loop for Synchronous DS-CDMA Systems","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10208430","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425809/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Decorrelated Delay Lock Loop for Synchronous DS-CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-wong-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058321S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4425809","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4425810,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zhao","affiliation":["LitePoint Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290791500"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093000"},{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538867500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4425810","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Fading","Rayleigh channels","Maximum likelihood decoding","Mobile communication","Receiving antennas","Performance analysis","Channel estimation","Binary phase shift keying","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","modulation","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative relay","binary modulation","Nakagami-m fading channels","wireless relay system","destination node","bit-error probability","differential relay","cooperative communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average bit-error probability (BEP)","cooperative diversity","Nakagami fading","wireless relays"]},{"kwd":["Cooperative diversity","wireless relays","average BEP","Nakagami fading"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425810","abstract":"We consider a wireless cooperative relay system with one source, one relay, and one destination node.

However, despite its merits, MDA remains insufficient for software system development, in the sense that it does not provide a concrete and comprehensive process for governing software development activities. There is therefore a strongly felt need for new model-driven software development methodologies. In this paper we review a number of existing model-driven methodologies, and propose a general framework for model-driven development (MDD) based on MDA. The framework can be used for assessing and comparing methodologies, engineering new methodologies, and adapting existing ones so that they meet the special requirements of the model-driven approach. We have used the framework herein to show how agile methodologies fare in this model-driven development context.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Context modeling","Computer architecture","Software engineering","Standards development","Concrete","Software standards","Engineering management","Software systems","Abstracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","software architecture","systems analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven architecture","software engineering","Object Management Group","software system development","model-driven software development methodology","agile methodology","formal specification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASPEC.2007.58","publicationTitle":"14th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"14th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425817/4425818/04425887.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPEC.2007.58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodology Support for the Model Driven Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Methodology Support for the Model Driven Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425887/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425887/","accessionNumber":"9882574","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodology Support for the Model Driven Architecture","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"30570454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083856S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425817","isNumber":"4425818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425817","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4425818","articleId":"4425887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4425953,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivasa K.G.","firstName":"Srinivasa","lastName":"K.G.","id":"37087155920"},{"name":"Srichand P.","firstName":"Srichand","lastName":"P.","id":"37087153938"},{"name":"Anuj Bhat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Anuj","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37830294700"},{"name":"Venugopal K.R.","firstName":"Venugopal","lastName":"K.R.","id":"37085372096"},{"name":"L.M.

The prob- lem statement is broken down, to describe discrete charac- teristics. Each landscape, described by its fitness landscape is used to optimize or amplify a certain characteristic or set of characteristics. Individuals from each of these pop- ulations are kept geographically isolated from each other. Each population is evolved individually. After a predeter- mined number of evolutions, the system of populations is analysed against a normalized fitness function. Depending on this score and a predefined merging scheme, the popula- tions are merged, one at a time, while continuing evolution. Merging continues until only one final population remains. This population is then evolved, following which the result- ing population will contain the optimal solution. The fi- nal resulting population will contain individuals which have been optimized against all characteristics as desired by the problem statement. Each individual population is optimized for a local maxima. Thus when populations are merged, the effect is to produce a new population which is closer to the global maxima.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2007.75","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425922/4425923/04425953.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2007.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm with Characteristic Amplification through Multiple Geographically Isolated Populations and Varied Fitness Landscapes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm with Characteristic Amplification through Multiple Geographically Isolated Populations and Varied Fitness Landscapes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425953/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm with Characteristic Amplification through Multiple Geographically Isolated Populations and Varied Fitness Landscapes","confLoc":"Guwahati, India","sourcePdf":"30590069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053132S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425922","isNumber":"4425923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425922","xplore-issue":"4425923","articleId":"4425953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4425954,"authors":[{"name":"Praveen Kumar K.","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, Karnataka, IN"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Kumar K.","id":"37087883564"},{"name":"S.

One major difficulty in identifying these gene subsets is the availability of only a few samples compared to the number of genes in the samples. Here we treat this problem as a Multi-objective optimization problem of minimizing the gene subset size and minimizing the number of misclassified samples. We present a new elitist non-dominated sorting-based genetic algorithm (NSGA) called memetic- NSGA which uses the concept of memes. Memes are a group of genes which have a particular functionality at the phenotype level. We have chosen a 50 gene Leukemia dataset to evaluate our algorithm. A comparative study between Memetic-NSGA and another non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, called NSGA-II, is presented. Memetic-NSGA is found to perform better in terms of execution time and gene-subset length identified.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2007.114","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425922/4425923/04425954.pdf","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2007.114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memetic NSGA - a multi-objective genetic algorithm for classification of microarray data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sorting","Genetic mutations","Educational institutions","Gene expression","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","genetic algorithms","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memetic NSGA","multiobjective genetic algorithm","microarray data classification","gene expression","gene subset","multiobjective optimization","memes","leukemia dataset","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Memetic NSGA - a multi-objective genetic algorithm for classification of microarray data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4425954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9903883","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memetic NSGA - a multi-objective genetic algorithm for classification of microarray data","confLoc":"Guwahati, India","sourcePdf":"30590075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072426S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425922","isNumber":"4425923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425922","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4425923","articleId":"4425954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4425955,"authors":[{"name":"Millie Pant","affiliation":["Department of Paper Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Saharanpur, India"],"firstName":"Millie","lastName":"Pant","id":"37603464400"},{"name":"Radha Thangaraj","affiliation":["Department of Paper Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Saharanpur, India"],"firstName":"Radha","lastName":"Thangaraj","id":"37602969200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3059-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4425955","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Diversity reception","Humans","Genetic mutations","Equations","Evolutionary computation","Space exploration","Birds","Paper technology","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadratic crossover","diversity guided PSO algorithm","global optimization problems","swarm population","basic particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4425955","abstract":"In this paper we have presented a new variant of diversity guided PSO algorithm named QIPSO for solving global optimization problems.

With increasing complexity of modern software, there is an increased demand of measurement tools for software maintainability, so that it can be estimated in early phases of the project development and corrective measures can be initiated to make it more manageable and maintainable. The importance of measuring maintainability in the starting phases of software evolution has been widely acknowledged by researchers and software managers, but only few metrics have been proposed to measure it. Recently many researchers have proposed some integrated models for maintainability measurement, which need to be calibrated in spite of their reported validations, as no attention has been paid to evaluate and improve the stability of these methods. This paper proposes a methodology to improve the stability of a fuzzy logic based maintainability metrics system. Fuzzy system parameters are tuned using genetic algorithm with system condition number as objective function for optimization.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2007.69","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425922/4425923/04425956.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2007.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of genetic algorithm for software maintainability metrics' conditioning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4425956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Use of genetic algorithm for software maintainability metrics' conditioning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9903885","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4425956/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of genetic algorithm for software maintainability metrics' conditioning","confLoc":"Guwahati, India","sourcePdf":"30590087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078647S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425922","isNumber":"4425923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425922","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4425923","articleId":"4425956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4425992,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.B.

In future fault tolerant techniques will be important to increase the yield of the VLSI chips in advanced fabrication technologies. In regular structure like FPGA, redundancy is commonly used for fault tolerance. Most of the techniques found so far in literature talk about software based changes in the configuration data. In this work we present a solution in which configuration bit stream of FPGA is modified by a hardware controller that is present on the chip itself. The technique uses redundant columns for replacing faulty cells. Experiments on different circuits using VPR tool shows that there is an average 2.6% increase in the critical path delay while no increase in the area per cell due to our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425922/4425923/04426018.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2007.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2007.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425923","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Controlled and Software Independent Fault Tolerant FPGA Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Fault tolerance","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Fabrication","Production","Very large scale integration","Redundancy","Circuit faults","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA architecture","fault tolerance","VLSI chip","hardware controller","VPR tool","critical path delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Controlled and Software Independent Fault Tolerant FPGA Architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4426018/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9903908","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Controlled and Software Independent Fault Tolerant FPGA Architecture","confLoc":"Guwahati, India","sourcePdf":"30590497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050932S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425922","isNumber":"4425923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425922","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4425923","articleId":"4426018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426019,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

Leakage power in logic gates is strongly dependent on input patterns. By a suitable choice of input patterns (known as input vector) in standby mode, leakage power consumption can be greatly reduced. In this paper we have presented a genetic algorithm based input vector selection for combinational logic synthesis. We have also carried out a method to adopt high VT transistors wherever there is a gate with worst-case leakage even after applying proper input vector, while maintaining the delay constraint or with small performance degradation. On an average we found that the proposed IVC technique gives 17.15% improvement in leakage power reduction over random average power and with high VT transistors the improvement is as high as 32.49%.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2007.33","startPage":"503","endPage":"509","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2007.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4425923","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4425922/4425923/04426019.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Input State Assignment Technique for Leakage Power Minimization during Combinational Logic Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426019/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Input State Assignment Technique for Leakage Power Minimization during Combinational Logic Synthesis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4426019/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9895754","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Input State Assignment Technique for Leakage Power Minimization during Combinational Logic Synthesis","confLoc":"Guwahati, India","sourcePdf":"30590503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080546S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4425922","isNumber":"4425923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4425922","xplore-issue":"4425923","articleId":"4426019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":4426020,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Human inner ear based `feature extraction' leads to very robust speech understanding in noise. This `Model of Auditory Periphery' is acting as front-end model of this speech recognition process. This paper describes two quantitative models for signal processing in auditory system (i) Gamma Tone Filter Bank (GTFB) and (ii) Wavelet Packet (WP) as front- ends for robust speech recognition. The auditory feature vectors had been used to train neural network. The classification of the feature vectors was done by the neural network using Back Propagation (BP) algorithm. The system performance was measured by recognition rate with various signal-to- noise ratios over -10 to 10 dB. The proposed system's performance was compared with various types of front-ends and recognition methods such as auditory features with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) & Layered Neural Network (LRNN), auditory features with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) & LRNN and vocal tract model: MFCC & HMM, Dynamic time warping (DTW). The performances of proposed models with gamma tone filter bank and wavelet packet as front-ends were also compared.

Therefore, there could be a considerably large number of zero-valued inputs/outputs for the IDFT/DFT or IDCT/DCT on the OFDM transceiver. Hence, the standard methods of DFT and DCT are no longer efficient due to the wasted operations on zero.

Their results were compared to measured data of rain attenuation and their effectiveness and validity were examined through evaluating the slant path length adjustment factor and the rain height.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of Rain Attenuation Parameter for Satellite Communications at 12.25GHz","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2007.82","displayPublicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426076/4426077/04426139.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2007.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of Rain Attenuation Parameter for Satellite Communications at 12.25GHz","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4426139/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895099","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of Rain Attenuation Parameter for Satellite Communications at 12.25GHz","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30480313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043552S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426076","isNumber":"4426077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426076","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4426077","articleId":"4426139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4426140,"authors":[{"name":"Dong You Choi","affiliation":["Department of Information Communication Engineering, Chosun University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong You","lastName":"Choi","id":"37655989900"},{"name":"Jung Jin Park","affiliation":["Department of Information Communication Engineering, Graduate School of Chosun University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Jin","lastName":"Park","id":"37066790700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3048-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4426140","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Base stations","Interference","Frequency","Structural beams","Power engineering and energy","Channel capacity","Directional antennas","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","quality of service","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell sectorization","CDMA mobile communication systems","quality of services","QoS","power control","pilot channel","wide-beam three sector cell","narrow-beam three sector cell"]}],"abstract":"Cell sectorization and improvement of the Ec/Io are technologies to offer good quality of services (QoS) and coverage for new and sophisticated power control to achieve high capacity in CDMA cellular mobile communication networks.

Two perceptual distortion sensitivity models are created to minimize the perceptual distortion rather than traditional MAE distortion. Lagrange multiplier is adjusted adaptively according to these perceptual models during the RDO process. Larger Lagrange multiplier is assigned to regions that are perceptually less sensitive to distortion so that the rate- reduction is weighted more than distortion reductions in these regions. While smaller Lagrange multiplier is arranged to the perceptual distortion sensitive regions. Experimental results show that the proposed PALM method effectively improves the subjective quality in the most perceptually prominent regions with no notable loss in PSNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426076/4426077/04426165.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"463","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2007.179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2007.179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptually Adaptive Lagrange Multiplier for Rate-Distortion Optimization in H.264","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lagrangian functions","Rate-distortion","Video coding","PSNR","Quadratic programming","Bit rate","Automatic voltage control","Motion control","Humans","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","optimisation","rate distortion theory","sensitivity analysis","video coding","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptually adaptive Lagrange multiplier","rate-distortion optimization","H.264 video coding","HVS features","Human Visual System","sensitivity models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Perceptually Adaptive Lagrange Multiplier for Rate-Distortion Optimization in H.264","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4426165/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895125","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptually Adaptive Lagrange Multiplier for Rate-Distortion Optimization in H.264","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30480459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066574S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426076","isNumber":"4426077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426076","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4426077","articleId":"4426165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4426184,"authors":[{"name":"Nanqing Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electrical Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Nanqing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37831448800"},{"name":"Hao Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electrical Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537724300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3048-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4426184","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Nonlinear distortion","Linearity","Support vector machines","Power amplifiers","Peak to average power ratio","Degradation","Filters","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear estimation","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear channel estimation","multi level PN sequences","OFDM systems","nonlinear distortion","power amplifier","ordinary predistortion","power receiver","wireless channel","Vandermonde matrix"]}],"abstract":"Nonlinear distortion of power amplifier is one of the major factor that degrades the performance of OFDM systems. Instead of estimating the nonlinearity at transmitter such as ordinary pre-distortion (PD), this paper estimates the nonlinearity of amplifier at the receiver. The problem is that nonlinear and multipath dispersion mix together at receiver end. And their parameters are generally unknown, so conventional method doesn't work well. In this paper, an algorithm that estimates both the nonlinear parameters of the power amplifier and the impulse response of the wireless channel is proposed. Multi-level PN sequences are transmitted to construct a Vandermonde matrix, which separates the nonlinearity and linearity into different subspaces. The separation makes it easy to estimate the nonlinearity and linearity independently.","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2007.170","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426076/4426077/04426184.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2007.170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426077","startPage":"570","endPage":"574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Channel Estimation Based on Multi-level PN Sequence in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Channel Estimation Based on Multi-level PN Sequence in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426184/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895144","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4426184/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Channel Estimation Based on Multi-level PN Sequence in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30480570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.169741S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426076","isNumber":"4426077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426076","xplore-issue":"4426077","articleId":"4426184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4426203,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Hyouk Lee","affiliation":["Internet Management Technology Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Hyouk","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292722900"},{"name":"Byung-Jin Han","affiliation":["Internet Management Technology Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Jin","lastName":"Han","id":"37291876900"},{"name":"Hyo-Keun Bang","affiliation":["Internet Management Technology Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyo-Keun","lastName":"Bang","id":"37840344600"},{"name":"Tai-Myoung Chung","affiliation":["Internet Management Technology Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tai-Myoung","lastName":"Chung","id":"37292161300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3048-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4426203","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Load management","Quality of service","Bandwidth","Internet","Signal processing","WiMAX","Technology management","Engineering management","Paper technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","genetic algorithms","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access points allocation","genetic algorithm","wireless device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426203","abstract":"This paper presents an optimal access points allocation scheme based on genetic algorithm.

The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed rate-control scheme achieved the target packet error rate while increasing the throughout for ZFBF-MU- MIMO systems as the number of user candidates increases.","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2007.190","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426076/4426188/04426223.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2007.190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Control for Zero-Forcing Beamforming Multiuser MIMO Systems with QR-Decomposition MLD Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426223/","displayDocTitle":"Rate Control for Zero-Forcing Beamforming Multiuser MIMO Systems with QR-Decomposition MLD Receiver","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895176","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4426223/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Control for Zero-Forcing Beamforming Multiuser MIMO Systems with QR-Decomposition MLD Receiver","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30480159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035903S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426076","isNumber":"4426188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426076","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426188","articleId":"4426223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426224,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Luo","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37833348900"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"},{"name":"Choi Look Law","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Choi Look","lastName":"Law","id":"37279807600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3048-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4426224","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426224","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Frequency domain analysis","Peak to average power ratio","Wireless communication","Mean square error methods","Computer simulation","Fading","Interference cancellation","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA","MC-CDMA","per-user MMSE frequency domain equalization","direct sequence code-division multiple access","multicarrier CDMA","high rate wireless communication","linear per user minimum mean square error detection"]}],"abstract":"Direct sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) and multicarrier (MC-) CDMA are two important CDMA schemes for high rate wireless communication.

To resolve this problem, an iterative estimation and cancellation of clipping non-linear distortion scheme is proposed. This paper presents that the performance of iterative estimation and cancellation of clipping non-linear distortion is better than that of clipping noise. The method of iterative estimation and cancellation of clipping non-linear distortion can recover the signal before clipping perfectly with the ideal feedback data. However, if receiver only estimate and cancel the clipping noise the signal will still be influenced by the attenuation caused by clipping. Analysis and simulation results prove the conclusion.

It can reduce the feedback rate by tracking the precoding matrices on Grassmann manifold according to the time domain correlation feature of channel fading. And the main idea of the proposed approach is to adjust the feedback overhead to the varying of channel fading adaptively. It makes sure that the optimal precoding matrices can be chosen by the precoder. Therefore, the degradation of performance can be neglected. The contribution of this paper is to propose an adaptive tracking algorithm on time domain. Compared with the limited feedback precoding, the proposed algorithm can reduce the feedback overhead to the half. In this paper, auto-regressive model is used for temporal correlative channel. Moreover, the numerical simulation results have been demonstrated and some critical factors have been analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426076/4426188/04426234.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2007.46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2007.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Time Domain Tracking Method for Limited-Rate Feedback Precoding in MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","MIMO","Transmitters","Fading","Degradation","Channel state information","Frequency domain analysis","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","channel coding","fading channels","feedback","MIMO communication","precoding","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain tracking method","limited-rate feedback precoding","MIMO systems","time domain correlation","channel fading","optimal precoding matrices","adaptive tracking algorithm","feedback overhead","auto-regressive model","temporal correlative channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Time Domain Tracking Method for Limited-Rate Feedback Precoding in MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4426234/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895187","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Time Domain Tracking Method for Limited-Rate Feedback Precoding in MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30480212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069531S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426076","isNumber":"4426188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426076","xplore-issue":"4426188","articleId":"4426234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426237,"authors":[{"name":"Defu Sun","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Defu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37832824700"},{"name":"Youxi Tang","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Youxi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37277296700"},{"name":"Shihai Shao","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shihai","lastName":"Shao","id":"37544445300"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3048-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4426237","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Space-Time Modulation for Modified V-BLAST System","abstract":"This paper proposes a differential en/decoding scheme for the modified Vertical-Bell Labs layered space-time (V-BLAST) system, where each spatially multiplexed data stream is intentionally inserted with delay offset.

To achieve a large diversity gain for combating fast time-varying and frequency-selective fading as well as tolerating imperfect synchronization among mobile nodes, we propose an asynchronous cooperative transmission scheme using distributed unitary space-frequency coded OFDM (USFC-OFDM), which has a lower decoding complexity with no need for any channel estimation and can provide better reliability and robustness when nodes move fast. A TDMA-based cooperative medium access control (CMAC) mechanism and an on-demand cooperative routing protocol are also proposed to support the USFC-OFDM scheme. Through simulation results, we show that the proposed USFC-OFDM scheme can significantly improve the network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and bit error rate in highly dynamic MANET environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426076/4426188/04426251.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2007.71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2007.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Cooperative Transmission Using Distributed Unitary Space-Frequency Coded OFDM in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Mobile ad hoc networks","Diversity methods","Frequency diversity","Frequency estimation","Fading","Frequency synchronization","Decoding","Channel estimation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel estimation","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","routing protocols","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc networks","asynchronous cooperative transmission","distributed unitary OFDM","space-frequency coded OFDM","diversity gain","time-varying fading","frequency-selective fading","channel estimation","TDMA-based cooperative medium access control cooperative routing protocol","USFC-OFDM scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Cooperative Transmission Using Distributed Unitary Space-Frequency Coded OFDM in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4426251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895204","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Cooperative Transmission Using Distributed Unitary Space-Frequency Coded OFDM in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30480291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052002S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426076","isNumber":"4426188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426076","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426188","articleId":"4426251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4426289,"authors":[{"name":"Ze-Guang Jin","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ze-Guang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37655171300"},{"name":"Heau-Jo Kang","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heau-Jo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37655006500"},{"name":"Yoon-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon-Ho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37657141200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3048-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4426289","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Antenna arrays","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Adaptive systems","Adaptive filters","Filtering","Interference suppression","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","code division multiple access","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","multicarrier CDMA system","Nakagami fading channels","intersymbol interference","interference suppression"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analysis the multicarrier code-division multiple-acess(MC-CDMA) based on a fractionally spreading, ie.

This circuit can be designed with minimal multiplexers, and thus can efficiently generate digit-reversed sequences compared with digit reversal circuits based on a binary counter.","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2007.7","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Future Generation Communication and Networking (FGCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426076/4426188/04426291.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2007.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digit Reversal Circuit for the Variable-Length Radix-4 FFT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Digit Reversal Circuit for the Variable-Length Radix-4 FFT","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895242","htmlLink":"/document/4426291/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digit Reversal Circuit for the Variable-Length Radix-4 FFT","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30480496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058045S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426076","isNumber":"4426188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426076","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4426188","articleId":"4426291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4426299,"authors":[{"name":"Jaemin Kwak","affiliation":["SoC Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaemin","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37421973400"},{"name":"Kitaek Lim","affiliation":["SoC Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute"],"firstName":"Kitaek","lastName":"Lim","id":"37835909300"},{"name":"Pusik Park","affiliation":["SoC Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute"],"firstName":"Pusik","lastName":"Park","id":"37065887200"},{"name":"Daekyo Shin","affiliation":["SoC Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute"],"firstName":"Daekyo","lastName":"Shin","id":"37418409600"},{"name":"Jongchan Choi","affiliation":["SoC Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute"],"firstName":"Jongchan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37422712200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3048-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4426299","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Radio spectrum management","OFDM","Standardization","Transmitters","Intersymbol interference","Estimation error","Guidelines","Frequency synchronization","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal preamble power allocation","frequency offset estimation","OFDM","packet communication systems","preamble sequence","mean squared error performance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an frequency offset estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based packet communication systems is proposed, in which allocated powers of the short training symbols and long training symbols are different while maintaining average power of overall preamble sequence.

EMRI by single point imaging (SPI) modality is a Fourier imaging technique. The bioclearance of the imaging agent as well as the need to minimize the radio frequency (RF) power deposition on the live animals, dictate reduced k-space sampling. This leads to ringing (Gibbs) artifacts which are severe and seen in both directions of the 2D image, because, unlike the conventional MRI, SPI is phase encoding in both directions. To dampen the high frequency components, data tapering windows are multiplicatively applied to provide tolerable blurred resultant image with reduced Gibbs ringing. To find a compromise between blur and ringing artifact, in this paper a method of optimizing the window functions by using genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. The proposed algorithm is validated, using Matlab codes, first reconstructing MRI image of Shepp Logan head phantom from simulated k-space data, and next tested by reconstructing real EMR images of phantoms and live mice from experimentally acquired k-space data. Image quality metrics viz. signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), root mean square error (RMSE), standard deviation (STD) and the Liu's error function F(I) are computed. Our experiments suggest GA-based Kaiser window provides good optimal blur/ringing compromise in EMR tomograms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.167","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426319/04426412.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"471","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary Computational Approach for Artifact-Free Image Reconstruction from Reduced Samples: Application to Fourier EMRI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Computational Approach for Artifact-Free Image Reconstruction from Reduced Samples: Application to Fourier EMRI","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4426412/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895502","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426412/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Computational Approach for Artifact-Free Image Reconstruction from Reduced Samples: Application to Fourier EMRI","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042895S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","xplore-issue":"4426319","articleId":"4426412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426417,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Hence different optimization techniques to improve the performance of the DCT are discussed here. For DCT, VHDL codes were written in behavioral model for pipelined memory optimization design which reduces the memory requirement and cost of implementation. This design was also implemented on FPGA Spartan3e which occupied approximately 69,468 total equivalent gate count.

Wireless telemedicine is a new and evolving area in telemedical and telecare systems. It involves the use of mobile communication and multimedia technologies and their integration for new mobile healthcare delivery systems. In wireless Telemedicine, broadband multimedia data which is a combination of video, audio and externally acquired images is transmitted. This is cumbersome in our conventional wireless systems due to the limitations such as Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) and frequency selective fading. Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (COFDM) mitigates these problems and it can be used effectively for wireless telemedicine applications. COFDM is the best choice for digital audio and video broadcasting i.e. for multimedia data traffic. It is particularly suited for obtaining reliable reception of signals affected by ISI and frequency selective fading and by this technique transmission of high data rates can be achieved. In this paper COFDM technique is proposed as more suitable one for the broadband wireless telemedicine applications. System performance for various modulation schemes has been investigated. The effects of multipath propagation, frequency selective fading and the various fading channels like AWGN and Rayleigh have also been included in the analysis. Performance of COFDM scheme is compared with the uncoded OFDM strategy. Key Words : OFDM, COFDM, ISI, FFT, IFFT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suitability of Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (COFDM) for Multimedia Data Transmission in Wireless Telemedicine Applications","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.166","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426428/04426494.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Suitability of Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (COFDM) for Multimedia Data Transmission in Wireless Telemedicine Applications","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4426494/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suitability of Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (COFDM) for Multimedia Data Transmission in Wireless Telemedicine Applications","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03932S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4426428","articleId":"4426494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426497,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It essential to minimise the amount of noise added in the communication channel. The signal quality can be enhanced, by modelling the channel at the receiver, by means of equalization. Given large number of users employed in the system over multipath channels causing significant multiple-access interference (MAI) & inter symbol interference (ISI), the optimal MUD is thus prohibitively complex. Hence the sub-optimal detectors such as low-complexity linear & non-linear equalizers have to be considered. In this paper, recursive least square (RLS) adaptation algorithm for adaptive decision feedback turbo equalizer (ADFTE) is proposed. Along with the application of the adaptive method to the DFE-RLS equalizer, turbo-principle can easily be applied. The performance of the system is improved in the fashion of exchanging the extrinsic information iteratively among the soft-input/soft-output (SISO) equalizer & SISO channel decoder until convergence is achieved. The proposed turbo equalization implements the LOG-MAP (maximum a posterior) exclusively for both equalization & decoding. At each iteration, the estimated symbol is then saved as a priori information for next iteration. The simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm for DFE & turbo decoding offers performance gain improvement of 0.7 dB over the DFE-LMS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4426498/","accessionNumber":"9895556","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Decision Feedback Turbo Equalization (ADFTE) Using Recursive Least Square (RLS) Algorithm over Least Mean Square (LMS) Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Decision Feedback Turbo Equalization (ADFTE) Using Recursive Least Square (RLS) Algorithm over Least Mean Square (LMS) Algorithm","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034051S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426428","articleId":"4426498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4426502,"authors":[{"name":"Aruna Tripathy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur"],"firstName":"Aruna","lastName":"Tripathy","id":"37285301300"},{"name":"Aruna Tripathy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur"],"firstName":"Aruna","lastName":"Tripathy","id":"37285301300"},{"name":"S.S.

The maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) and soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) have been used as the workhorse of receivers that employ turbo principle. The MAP is preferred to SOVA because of its inherent ability to produce the log likelihood ratio (LLR) on each bit. However, it suffers from huge computational complexity, storage requirements. A sliding window MAP (SWMAP) algorithm addresses these two issues. Our objective in this paper is to investigate the effect of different window sizes on the average bit error rate (BER) performance of a turbo equalizer that uses this SWMAP as the equalizer and a SW SOVA algorithm as the decoder. This study is important as it establishes a lower limit on the window size that is acceptable without sacrificing much performance at a reasonable complexity. We evaluate the performance of this receiver by computer simulations. The results obtained for 3 different window sizes establish that, a window of size three times the length of the ISI channel is adequate to ensure a desirable performance with reduced complexity and storage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4426502/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Window Size on the Performance of a Turbo Equalizer Using a SWMAP Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Window Size on the Performance of a Turbo Equalizer Using a SWMAP Algorithm","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039798S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","xplore-issue":"4426428","articleId":"4426502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4426508,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Kumar Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Krishna Institute of Engineering and Technology, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay Kumar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37826370300"},{"name":"S.

Space-time codes (STC) are designed to exploit Multi-input and Multi-output (MIMO) antenna systems and by doing so, an enormous increase in the capacity of wireless systems can be achieved. STC can be viewed as combined coding and modulation scheme for Multi-input and Multi-output (MIMO) channels. Using an efficient way to allocate different symbols to different antennas, while adding coding redundancy, the code can achieve full antenna diversity and good coding gain. The paper presents space-time codes for MIMO wireless communications. Space-time codes employ redundancy to minimize the effects of fading, noise and interference. In a space-time block code, transmission of the signal takes place in blocks. Although, the Alamouti code does not perform as well as the same space-time trellis code, it is most preferred choice due to its computational, simplicity and satisfactory performance. The computer simulation compares the bit error rate (BER) performance of coherent binary PSK over an uncorrelated Rayleigh-fading channel for three different schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426428/04426508.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of MIMO Space-Time Coded Wireless Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless communication","Space time codes","Redundancy","Bit error rate","Modulation coding","Fading","Interference","Block codes","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","fading channels","interference suppression","MIMO communication","mobile radio","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO space-time coded wireless communication systems","broadband services over wireless links","broadband services over mobile links","MIMO antenna systems","MIMO channels","coding redundancy","antenna diversity","coding gain","space-time block code","bit error rate performance","Rayleigh-fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of MIMO Space-Time Coded Wireless Communication Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4426508/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895562","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of MIMO Space-Time Coded Wireless Communication Systems","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046207S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426428","articleId":"4426508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426513,"authors":[{"name":"S.

SDR is one of the radio platforms which is adaptive and provides future proof solutions to the wireless networks making them very flexible. The conventional hardware is replaced with reconfigurable, reprogrammable radio. SDR platform also balances against the risky condition of committing to fixed function and inflexible hardware in an environment of changing standards. OFDM is the modulation scheme which is mainly used in wireless communication. The orthogonal property maintained in OFDM eliminates the inter symbol interference which is a common problem in wireless communication. In the existing method wind flex platforms are used in which the modulation and coding techniques are implemented. The wind flex platform is limited to the indoor applications and not meant to support the multi standard operation.

Power flow study is the most frequently carried out study performed by power utilities and it is required in almost all the stages of power systems planning, operation and control. In this paper, two modules of counterpropagation neural networks (CPNN) are proposed to solve power flow problem under different loading/contingency conditions for computing bus voltage magnitudes and angles of the given power systems. It implements a pattern mapping task. Due to its fast training, the proposed CPNN will be particularly useful for power systems planning studies, as a number of combinations can be tried using it within a small time frame. The mathematical model of power flow comprises a set of non-linear algebraic equations conventionally solved with the Newton-Raphson method.

These applications include data mining (identifying a \"pattern\", e.g., correlation, or an outlier in millions of multidimensional patterns), document classifications (efficiently searching text documents), organization and retrieval of multimedia database, and biometrics (personal identifications based on various physical attributes such as face and fingerprints). The three best known conventional approaches for pattern recognition are: template matching, statistical classification and syntactic or structural matching. The limitations and constraints of these conventional approaches have made researchers to look for alternate techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks. The main characteristics of neural networks are that they have the ability to learn complex nonlinear input-output relationship, use sequential training procedures, and adapt themselves to the data. In this paper, we discuss implementation and fault tolerance analysis of the most commonly used family of neural networks for pattern classification tasks i.e., the feed forward network, which includes a fully interconnected three layered [25-10-1] perceptron. The delta rule weight adjustment is implemented by taking the gradient of error function, which gives the direction in which weights have to be adjusted to get error value within the predefined threshold. Fault tolerance analysis is done for Gaussian and Uniform distribution of weights. The efficacy of neural network based pattern recognition is tested by the computer simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.219","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","startPage":"222","endPage":"226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426531","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426531/04426583.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Pattern analysis","Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Artificial neural networks","Pattern matching","Computer errors","Data mining","Multidimensional systems","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","Gaussian distribution","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance analysis","neural network","pattern recognition","pattern classification task","delta rule weight adjustment","error function gradient","Gaussian distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault Tolerance Analysis of Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426583/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4426583/","accessionNumber":"9895344","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Tolerance Analysis of Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069699S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426531","articleId":"4426583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4426584,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This work involves selection of neural network, preparation of input training & testing patterns. In order to generate the training patterns two system topologies were considered.

There is a need to reliably detect the condition of the tool because it affects the product quality, increases machine downtime and sometimes affect the machine tool and the personnel. Tool condition monitoring (TCM) is important in the successful automation of manufacturing processes. In this paper, a new constructive learning algorithm proposed by Fritzke, namely Growing Cell Structures (GCS) is being used for tool wear estimation in face milling operation, thereby monitoring the condition of the tool. GCS generates compact network architecture in less training time and performs well on new untrained data, establishing its feasibility in tool wear estimation applications. The performance of this network has been compared with that of another constructive learning algorithm based neural network namely the Resource Allocation Network (RAN). GCS has been found to be effective and efficient for tool wear estimation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.102","startPage":"302","endPage":"319","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426531","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426531/04426597.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Growing Cell Structures (GCS) - A Constructive Learning Neural Network for Tool Wear Estimation Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426597/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Growing Cell Structures (GCS) - A Constructive Learning Neural Network for Tool Wear Estimation Application","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4426597/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9895354","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Growing Cell Structures (GCS) - A Constructive Learning Neural Network for Tool Wear Estimation Application","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073962S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","xplore-issue":"4426531","articleId":"4426597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4426598,"authors":[{"name":"Maya V.

One of the common complaints about the Standard Backpropagation algorithm (SBP) is that it is very slow. Even simple problems may take hundreds of iterations to converge. SBP algorithm reduces only non-linear errors. Much work, therefore has been done in search of faster methods. One of such approach is modified form of the Standard Backpropagation algorithm. Modified Backpropagation algorithm consists of minimizing the sum of the squares of linear and non- linear errors for all output units. This leads to an efficient process in the network. Proper initialization always plays a key role in the robust neural networks. Therefore, the optimum initialization method is used for weight initialization, which ensures the outputs of neurons are in the active region and the range of activation function is fully utilized. Since the proposed method uses the constructive approach, there is no need to make a prior estimate of the correct network size. The proposed method is implemented on 2 bit parity problem, 4 bit parity checker and encoder problem and produced good results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.259","startPage":"325","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426531","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426531/04426601.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Constructive Approach of Modified Standard Backpropagation Algorithm with Optimum Initialization for Feedforward Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426601/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Constructive Approach of Modified Standard Backpropagation Algorithm with Optimum Initialization for Feedforward Neural Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4426601/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Constructive Approach of Modified Standard Backpropagation Algorithm with Optimum Initialization for Feedforward Neural Networks","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057354S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4426531","articleId":"4426601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4426602,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This type of problem is known as multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). In general a MOP has been solved using weighted sums or decision-making schemes. An alternative way is to look for the Pareto-optimal front. Many evolutionary algorithms (EAs) like genetic algorithm (GA) have been suggested to solve a MOP, hence termed as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is one such MOEA which demonstrates the ability to indentify a Pareto-optimal front efficiently. Thus, it provides the decision maker (DM) a complete picture of the optimal solution space. This paper presents an application of NSGA-II in order to solve a multi-objective series system reliability optimization problem. Here, conflicting objectives such as maximization of system reliability and minimization of the system cost have been considered.

Due to the sequential nature of the Web user's activity, Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) is particularly well adapted for the study of Web usage data. Traditional SPM techniques with very low support produce large number of SPs. They are unsuitable for extraction of knowledge about the minority users because of large diversified user's behaviors and difficult to locate. Here, we propose a novel approach called Cluster and Extract Sequential Patterns (CESP) that works based on divisive principle, where initial large Web log data split into smaller clusters(sub-logs) through ART1 neural network based clustering, and then Apriori like SPM technique is applied on each Cluster to extract SPs which reveal the behaviors of minority users. Several experiments were conducted on diversified Web log files, enabled us to discover interesting SPs having very low support (0.06 %). The study reveals that discovery of such SPs by a traditional SPM algorithms were impractical.

With the advent of high-density microelectronic devices, power dissipation of VLSI circuits has become a critical concern. Consequently power estimation accuracy at higher levels is an important issue to avoid costly redesign steps. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with its capability to derive some meaning from complicated or imprecise data has been exploited for this purpose. A simple Back Propagation (BP) algorithm is employed to train a feed-forward neural network with the available data set to find out the weights and biases of the interconnecting layers, and subsequently the neural network is used as a model to determine the power dissipation for test inputs. The experimental results have been compared with that of the previous approaches and accordingly it establishes the effectiveness of the proposed approach for high level power estimation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.117","startPage":"159","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426647","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426647/04426687.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based Macromodels for High Level Power Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426687/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Macromodels for High Level Power Estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4426687/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9903742","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Macromodels for High Level Power Estimation","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056327S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426647","articleId":"4426687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4426689,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

In order to compute convolution of long sequence, overlap-add method (OLA) and overlap-save method (OLS) can be considered. The OLA and OLS are well known efficient schemes for high-order filtering. The most commonly used implementation for digital filtering algorithms are digital signal processors, special purpose digital filtering chips and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for large volumes. In this paper, a high performance, high throughput and area efficient architecture for the field programmable gate array (FPGAs) implementation of block convolution process is proposed. The most significant aspect of the proposed method is the development of a multiplier architecture based on vertical and crosswise structure of ancient Indian Vedic mathematics and embedding it in OLA and OLS methods for improved efficiency. The coding is done in VHDL (very high speed integrated circuits hardware description language) and the FPGA synthesis is done using Xilinx Spartan library. The results shows that OLA and OLS method of block convolution implemented using Vedic multiplication is efficient in terms of area/speed compared to its implementation using conventional multiplier architectures.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.332","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426647/04426689.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Speed Block Convolution Using Ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A High Speed Block Convolution Using Ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4426689/","accessionNumber":"9895405","volume":"2","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Speed Block Convolution Using Ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027684S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","isNumber":"4426647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4426689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4426691,"authors":[{"name":"Swinder Kaur","affiliation":["University Institute of Engineering & Technology, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Swinder","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37839327900"},{"name":"Renu Vig","affiliation":["University Institute of Engineering & Technology, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Renu","lastName":"Vig","id":"37721596100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3050-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4426691","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Cryptography","Hardware","Clocks","Signal processing","Testing","Communication system security","Cryptographic protocols","Circuits","Computational intelligence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426691","abstract":"This paper presents an efficient FPGA implementation approach of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm.

A 119.954 MHz clock frequency is achieved which translates to a throughput of 1.18 Gbps using 6279 Slices and 5 BRAMs. The design handles both encryption and decryption and fits into a single FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.250","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426647/04426691.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Implementation of AES Algorithm in FPGA Device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementation of AES Algorithm in FPGA Device","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4426691/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementation of AES Algorithm in FPGA Device","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055304S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4426647","articleId":"4426691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426692,"authors":[{"name":"Richa Garg","affiliation":["University Institute of Engineering & Technology, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Richa","lastName":"Garg","id":"37838113100"},{"name":"Renu Vig","affiliation":["University Institute of Engineering & Technology, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Renu","lastName":"Vig","id":"37721596100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3050-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4426692","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426692","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Throughput","Arithmetic","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Process design","Logic","Delay","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carry logic","multiplying circuits","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Montgomery multiplication algorithm","RSA cryptographic processor","silicon architecture","multi-bit shifting","carry-save addition","long-integer arithmetic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.272","endPage":"195","startPage":"188","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426647/04426692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Montgomery Multiplication Algorithm and RSA Cryptographic Processor","abstract":"New, generic silicon architecture for implementing Montgomery's multiplication algorithm is presented. This paper proposes an efficient Montgomery modular multiplication technique that employs multi-bit shifting and carry-save addition to perform long-integer arithmetic. The gain in data throughput for Montgomery multiplication is approximately 45.49% (for 1024-bit length) and the hardware reduction is 24.27% of the traditional methods. Hence, the corresponding hardware realization is optimal in terms of area and offer higher data throughput for Montgomery multiplication. The practical application of this approach has been demonstrated by applying this to the design of RSA processor architecture with 512-bit and 1024-bit key size. The RSA processor also offers higher throughput (32.18% for 1024-bit) with a slight increase in area (22.4%). This optimization is also technology independent and thus should suit well not only FPGA implementation but also ASIC. The Montgomery design and RSA processor has been evaluated on Xilinx Virtex-4 series for the practical bit lengths of 512, 1024 and 2048. The resulting Montgomery multiplier and the RSA processor performance results presented at the fastest reported to date in literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426692/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4426692/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9895407","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Montgomery Multiplication Algorithm and RSA Cryptographic Processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Montgomery Multiplication Algorithm and RSA Cryptographic Processor","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03237S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4426647","articleId":"4426692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4426706,"authors":[{"name":"B.V.

This paper presents a novel hybrid pattern recognizer for classification of power quality disturbances. The hybrid learning methodology integrates a multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA) and decision trees (CART) in order to evolve optimal subsets of discriminatory features for robust pattern classification. In the training phase the multiobjective GA based on the wrapper approach is used to find a subset of relevant attributes that minimizes both classification error rate and size of the tree discovered by the classification algorithm, namely CART, using the Pareto dominance approach. For a given feature subset, CART is invoked to produce a decision tree; the classification error and the complexity of the decision tree are used as the fitness functions by the GA to evolve better subsets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed multiobjective GA-CART combined approach yields improved classification performance and reduced classification time as compared to standard CART decision trees.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.339","startPage":"276","endPage":"280","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426318/4426647/04426706.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Learning Using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms and Decision Trees for Power Quality Disturbance Pattern Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Decision trees","Power quality","Pattern recognition","Classification tree analysis","Error analysis","Classification algorithms","Monitoring","Voltage fluctuations","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","Pareto optimisation","pattern recognition","power engineering computing","power supply quality","power system faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid learning","multiobjective genetic algorithm","decision trees","power quality disturbance","pattern recognition","pattern classification","classification error rate","Pareto dominance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Learning Using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms and Decision Trees for Power Quality Disturbance Pattern Recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4426706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9895414","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Learning Using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms and Decision Trees for Power Quality Disturbance Pattern Recognition","confLoc":"Sivakasi, India","sourcePdf":"30500276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047734S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426318","isNumber":"4426647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426318","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426647","articleId":"4426706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4426726,"authors":[{"name":"Pankaj Agarwal","affiliation":["CSE Department, Krishna Institute of Engineering and Technology, Ghaziabad, India"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37085345243"},{"name":"S.A.M.

Since the abnormal heart beats can occur randomly it becomes very tedious and time-consuming to analyze say a 24 hour ECG signal, as it may contain hundreds of thousands of heart beats. Hence it is desired to automate the entire process of heart beat classification and preferably diagnose it accurately In this paper the authors have focused on the various schemes for extracting the useful features of the ECG signals for use with artificial neural networks. Arrhythmia is one such type of abnormality detectable by an ECG signal. The three classes of ECG signals are Normal, Fusion and Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC). The task of an ANN based system is to correctly identify the three classes, most importantly the PVC type, this being a fatal cardiac condition. Discrete Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis, and Discrete Wavelet Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform are the four schemes discussed and compared in this paper.

Compared with the recently-proposed semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation based algorithm, our algorithm has a simpler mathematical formulation, and a much lower computational complexity. In particular, to segment an image of M \u00d7 N pixels into k classes, our algorithm requires only O((M N k)m) complexity--a sharp contrast to the complexity of O((M N k)2n ) offered by the SDP algorithm, where m and n are the polynomial degrees-of- complexity of the corresponding LP solver and SDP solver, respectively (in general we have m n). Moreover, LP has a significantly better scalability than SDP generally. This dramatic reduction in complexity enables our algorithm to process color images of reasonable sizes. For example, while the existing SDP relaxation algorithm is only able to segment a toy-size image of e.g. 10 \u00d7 10 30 \u00d7 30 pixels in a few hours, our algorithm can process larger color image of, say, 100 \u00d7 100 500 \u00d7 500 image in a much shorter time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Image Labelling Using Linear Programming","publicationTitle":"9th Biennial Conference of the Australian Pattern Recognition Society on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2007)","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2007.4426802","displayPublicationTitle":"9th Biennial Conference of the Australian Pattern Recognition Society on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426759/4426760/04426802.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2007.4426802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Color Image Labelling Using Linear Programming","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4426802/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Image Labelling Using Linear Programming","confLoc":"Glenelg, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"30670239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082368S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426759","isNumber":"4426760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426759","xplore-issue":"4426760","articleId":"4426802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426842,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Sriram","affiliation":["University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Sriram","id":"37300269000"},{"name":"David Kearney","affiliation":["University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kearney","id":"37266708400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4426842","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Atmospheric modeling","Computational modeling","Acceleration","Phased arrays","Layout","Apertures","Atmospheric waves","Hardware","Throughput"]}],"abstract":"In infrared (IR) scene simulation, modelling of wave- front distortions over finite aperture is carried out to simulate the phenomenon of scintillating IR sources resulting from atmospheric turbulence. Computation time of algorithms used to model this effect has always been an important issue and for this reason there have been many previous attempts to accelerate these algorithms. In this paper, we expand on our previous work [12] to accelerate phase screen generation using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We were able to develop a more area time efficient phase screen generator by two means. Firstly the key computationally intensive steps of the algorithm were identified and optimized. Secondly a parallel version of the algorithm for implementation on a FPGA was developed. Our best hardware implementation manages a throughput of 13,780 32bit, 201x201 outputs (called phase screen points) per second, which is over 8x the original algorithm's implementation on a Pentium 4(2.8GHz) dual core processor.","publicationTitle":"9th Biennial Conference of the Australian Pattern Recognition Society on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th Biennial Conference of the Australian Pattern Recognition Society on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426759/4426760/04426842.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Area Efficient Kolmogorov Phase Screen Generator Suitable for FPGA Implementation","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2007.4426842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2007.4426842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Area Efficient Kolmogorov Phase Screen Generator Suitable for FPGA Implementation","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4426842/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Area Efficient Kolmogorov Phase Screen Generator Suitable for FPGA Implementation","confLoc":"Glenelg, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"30670528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046241S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426759","isNumber":"4426760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426759","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4426760","articleId":"4426842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4426846,"authors":[{"name":"Ramtin Shams","affiliation":["Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Ramtin","lastName":"Shams","id":"37399292500"},{"name":"Nick Barnes","affiliation":["Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Barnes","id":"37281309800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4426846","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":447},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426846","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Hardware","Histograms","Computer architecture","Graphics","Image registration","Australia Council","Performance gain","Logic","Digital images"]}],"abstract":"We present an efficient method for mutual information (MI) computation between images (2D or 3D) for NVIDIA's `compute unified device architecture' (CUDA) compatible devices. Efficient parallelization of MI is particularly challenging on a `graphics processor unit' (GPU) due to the need for histogram-based calculation of joint and marginal probability mass functions (pmfs) with large number of bins. The data-dependent (unpredictable) nature of the updates to the histogram, together with hardware limitations of the GPU (lack of synchronization primitives and limited memory caching mechanisms) can make GPU-based computation inefficient. To overcome these limitation, we approximate the pmfs, using a down-sampled version of the joint- histogram which avoids memory update problems. Our CUDA implementation improves the efficiency of MI calculations by a factor of 25 compared to a standard CPU- based implementation and can be used in MI-based image registration applications.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2007.4426846","startPage":"555","publicationTitle":"9th Biennial Conference of the Australian Pattern Recognition Society on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th Biennial Conference of the Australian Pattern Recognition Society on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4426759/4426760/04426846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2007.4426846","endPage":"560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4426760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speeding up Mutual Information Computation Using NVIDIA CUDA Hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Speeding up Mutual Information Computation Using NVIDIA CUDA Hardware","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4426846/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speeding up Mutual Information Computation Using NVIDIA CUDA Hardware","confLoc":"Glenelg, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"30670555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050422S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426759","isNumber":"4426760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426759","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4426760","articleId":"4426846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4426853,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Real production grid workloads have shown diverse correlation structures and scaling behavior, which are different than the characteristics of the available supercomputer workloads and cannot be captured by Poisson or simple distribution-based models. We present models that are able to reproduce various correlation structures, including pseudo-periodicity and long range dependence. By conducting model-driven simulation, we quantitatively evaluate the performance impacts of workload correlations in grid scheduling. The results indicate that autocorrelations in workloads result in worse system performance, both at the local and the grid level. It is shown that realistic workload modeling is not only possible, but also necessary to enable dependable grid scheduling studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4426899/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9903976","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Simulation of Grid Scheduling Strategies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Simulation of Grid Scheduling Strategies","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"30640287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078224S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426856","isNumber":"4426857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426856","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4426857","articleId":"4426899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4426954,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Liu","affiliation":["Economics and Management Department, North China Electric Power University, China"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37400635300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3063-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3063-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4426954","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Biological system modeling","Computational biology","Evolution (biology)","Biological cells","Synchronous generators","Information technology","Power generation economics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426954","abstract":"The electric plant construction projects evaluation is a complex, multi-factor, multi-index decision-making problem.

But it is hard to select a proper operator in advance in the real word, because the objects are quite different. To incorporate the characteristic of the operators, several known operators were implemented to PSO all together, the results have shown that the performance was enhanced for most functions, but deteriorated for few functions. Besides which the function evaluations increased sharply with the increase of operators. To address the problem, an adaptive operator selection strategy is introduced where the swarm is divided into groups with different probabilities to employ the operators. The probabilities are adjusted adoptively by comparing the effectiveness of the groups to select a proper operator. The simulation results have shown PSO with the strategy provides robust and consistent performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4426982/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9895867","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4426982/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","conferenceDate":"2-3 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Modified Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Mutation Operator Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Mutation Operator Selection","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"30630133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086948S","chronDate":"2-3 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4426942","isNumber":"4426943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4426942","xplore-issue":"4426943","articleId":"4426982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4426985,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Shang","affiliation":["School of electronics and information, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Shang","id":"37312807000"},{"name":"Zhang Zaiyue","affiliation":["School of electronics and information, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Zaiyue","id":"37312807300"},{"name":"Zhang Xiaoru","affiliation":["School of electronics and information, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Xiaoru","id":"37296983200"},{"name":"Cao Cungen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cao","lastName":"Cungen","id":"37312799000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3063-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3063-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4426985","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4426985","abstract":"An Immune Genetic Algorithm (IGA) is used to solve weapon-target assignment problem (WTA).

Personalized and topic-sensitive PageRank are variants of the algorithm that return a local ranking based on each user's preferences as biased by a set of pages they trust or topics they prefer. In this paper we compare personalized and topic-sensitive local PageRanks to the global PageRank showing experimentally how similar or dissimilar results of personalization can be to the original global rank results and to other personalizations. Our approach is to examine a snapshot of the Web and determine how advantageous personalization can be in the best and worst cases and how it performs at various values of the damping factor in the PageRank formula.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WI.2007.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427044","startPage":"671","endPage":"675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427043/4427044/04427171.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Bounds on the Usefulness of Personalized and Topic-Sensitive PageRank","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4427171/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Bounds on the Usefulness of Personalized and Topic-Sensitive PageRank","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9894840","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Bounds on the Usefulness of Personalized and Topic-Sensitive PageRank","confLoc":"Fremont, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"30260671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030798S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427043","isNumber":"4427044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427043","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4427044","articleId":"4427171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4427210,"authors":[{"name":"Hosein Marzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, Saint Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, NS, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4463931/4427210/4427210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hosein Marzi (M'03\u2013SM'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical systems engineering from Cardiff University, Cardiff, U.K., in 1994.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Information Systems, St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, NS, Canada.

One recent trend is to effectively run desktop PC-oriented heavier applications on MHs. However, due to their miniature, portable size, MHs are resource-constrained and therefore, running these applications directly on an MH is not satisfactory given a user's expectations. To cope with this problem, this article proposes a novel offloading service that can seamlessly offload some of the tasks of a mobile application from an MH to nearby, resource-rich PCs (called surrogates). The system architecture and key components of the proposed offloading service are presented, prototyped, and evaluated. The results of experiments and simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of this offloading service for mobile applications.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4427231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4427218/04427231.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4427231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On effective offloading services for resource-constrained mobile devices running heavier mobile Internet applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","displayDocTitle":"On effective offloading services for resource-constrained mobile devices running heavier mobile Internet applications","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9747992","htmlLink":"/document/4427231/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On effective offloading services for resource-constrained mobile devices running heavier mobile Internet applications","sourcePdf":"013CHEN.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047259S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4427218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"4427218","articleId":"4427231","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4427241,"authors":[{"name":"Serhan Yarkan","affiliation":["University of South Florida, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Serhan Yarkan [StM] (syarkan@mail.usf.edu) received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Istanbul University, Turkey, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

In this work, location awareness is exploited to improve the wireless communication system design in CR. It is shown that several crucial wireless channel parameters are environment-dependent. In order for CR to relate a corresponding empirical model with an environment, the classification of propagation environments is outlined as well. The methods of characterizing the propagation environment for CR are also discussed. In addition, it is described how CR can carry out all these steps with the aid of a KRS along with RKRL and complete its adaptation cycle.

Recently, however, there have been calls to move beyond these entrenched positions, by developing pragmatic models and solutions that capture some of the benefits of each philosophical position. In this article we cautiously enter that no man's land with two illustrative dynamic spectrum access models. While both of our models retain a bias toward usage of spectrum resources based on a spectrum property rights approach, they also promote dynamic access and short-term dedication of spectrum resources. We call these models dynamic property rights spectrum access (D-Pass) and dynamic commons property rights spectrum access (D-CPass). In this work we focus primarily on engineering issues, proposing the use of a spectrum policy server as a clearinghouse and specifying the spectrum access mechanisms relevant to each model. To demonstrate the useful studies enabled through these models, we present illustrative results via the bandwidth utilization achieved under each model. Our results indicate that both the spectrum access mechanism and market forces will play important roles in determining the resulting bandwidth utilization.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4427243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4427218/04427243.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4427243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427218","startPage":"153","endPage":"160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access models: toward an engineering perspective in the spectrum debate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access models: toward an engineering perspective in the spectrum debate","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9748000","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4427243/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access models: toward an engineering perspective in the spectrum debate","sourcePdf":"025ILERI.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05497S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4427218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4427218","articleId":"4427243","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4427246,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed A.

The lumped-element approach used to build the directional coupler makes it possible to integrate the coupler onto a single monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), as it occupies a small area compared to printed designs. The directional coupler uses varactors and tunable active inductors (TAIs) to synthesize the series and shunt reactances, respectively, which allows extensive electronic control over the coupling coefficient, while insuring a low return loss and a very high isolation. Furthermore, using varactors and TAIs allows the directional coupler to be reconfigured for operation over a wide range of frequencies. Moreover, the symmetric configuration of the coupler allows it to switch from forward to backward operation by simply exchanging the bias voltages applied across the series varactors. The MMIC coupler was fabricated in a standard 0.13-mum CMOS process and operates from a 1.5-V supply. The circuit occupies 730 mum times 600 mum, and is capable of achieving tunable coupling coefficients from 1.4 to 7.1 dB, while maintaining an isolation higher than 41 dB. The MMIC coupler is also capable of operating at any center frequency over the 2.1-3.1-GHz frequency range with higher than 40-dB isolation. The coupler achieves a -4.1-dBm 1-dB compression point while operating from a 1.5-V supply.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Highly Reconfigurable CMOS MMIC Directional Coupler","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.913360","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4446042/04427246.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.913360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Highly Reconfigurable CMOS MMIC Directional Coupler","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4427246/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748439","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Highly Reconfigurable CMOS MMIC Directional Coupler","sourcePdf":"56tmtt02-abdalla.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077673S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4446042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4446042","articleId":"4427246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4427247,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron V.

The proposed predistortion linearizer is based on a nonlinear auto-regressive moving average (NARMA) structure, which can be derived from the NARMA PA behavioral model and then mapped into a set of scalable lookup tables (LUTs). The linearizer takes advantage of its recursive nature to relax the LUT count needed to compensate memory effects in PAs. Experimental support is provided by the implementation of the proposed NARMA DPD in a field-programmable gate-array device to linearize a 170-W peak power PA, validating the recursive DPD NARMA structure for W-CDMA signals and flexible transmission bandwidth scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that a recursive structure is experimentally validated for DPD purposes. In addition to the results on PA efficiency and linearity, this paper addresses many practical implementation issues related to the use of FPGA in DPD applications, giving an original insight on actual prototyping scenarios. Finally, this study discusses the possibility of further enhancing the overall efficiency by degrading the PA operation mode, provided that DPD may be unavoidable due to the impact of memory effects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748449","htmlLink":"/document/4427248/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Lookup Table FPGA Implementation of an Adaptive Digital Predistorter for Linearizing RF Power Amplifiers With Memory Effects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Lookup Table FPGA Implementation of an Adaptive Digital Predistorter for Linearizing RF Power Amplifiers With Memory Effects","sourcePdf":"56tmtt02-gilabert.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076448S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4446042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4446042","articleId":"4427248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4427251,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Nielsen","affiliation":["Technology Platforms Section, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4446042/4427251/4427251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Nielsen was born in Frederikshavn, Denmark, in 1979.

The square wave signal can give a theoretical efficiency of 100% for the subsequent PA. Such a system differs significantly from a conventional up-conversion and PA and, therefore, a significant design challenge results. The first important step is to generate the PWM signal. This paper demonstrates a functional modulator for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System operating at 2 GHz. The modulator is designed in a GaAs HBT process and uses low-frequency feedback combined with predistortion to obtain a high spectral purity.

The assembly of thinned silicon die (25-100 mum) onto flex substrates provides options for ultrathin, flexible electronics for applications ranging from smart cards to space-based radars. For high-density applications, 3-D modules can be fabricated by stacking and laminating preassembled and tested flex layers and then processing vertical interconnections. This paper describes a low cost, highly manufacturable process developed for flip chip assembly of thinned die to poly-imide flex substrates that eliminates the need for special handling tools and techniques. In this paper, solder bumped thinned die are reflow soldered to the patterned flex using a method that maintains the flex substrate flat during die placement and reflow. Reflow is followed by underfill dispense and cure. The underfill dispense process is critical to avoid underfill flowing onto the top of the thin silicon die and will be discussed. Parts assembled using these processes have undergone reliability testing, a high degree of reliability has been found, and those results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427304/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4427304/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"10006869","volume":"31","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Flip Chip Assembly of Thinned Silicon Die on Flex Substrates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flip Chip Assembly of Thinned Silicon Die on Flex Substrates","sourcePdf":"31tepm01-banda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048409S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4427303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4427303","articleId":"4427304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4427305,"authors":[{"name":"Leandro G.

A practical model description that decomposes the overall steady-state process in independently modeled subspaces is provided. The neural network model can be updated in real-time procuring a method to control the process by dynamically searching the optimal set point of the control variables. The optimization is performed by minimizing the weighted mean squared error with respect to the desired solder brick height or volume; furthermore, in the case when multiple solutions exist, the set point that yields the lowest variance is used. The process simulator is mainly suitable for offline testing and debugging of more complex closed-loop control algorithms for the SPP optimization providing a common and realistic framework for algorithm performance evaluation. An important consideration in this paper is based on the fact that the estimation of the sampled moments of the probability distributions is made using a statistically significant number of data samples from each board, for each component type, for each printing direction, and for each pad orientation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4427305/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","accessionNumber":"10006870","volume":"31","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stencil Printing Process Modeling and Control Using Statistical Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stencil Printing Process Modeling and Control Using Statistical Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"31tepm01-barajas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078763S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4427303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4427303","articleId":"4427305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4427325,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua D.

The theory and design methodology of the DRAF are elucidated using the cylindrical DR. It was found that the operating frequency of the filter part can be made equal to, or different from, that of the antenna part. The return loss, input impedance, radiation patterns, and insertion loss of the DRAF are studied. To improve the insertion loss of the filter part, the DR is top-loaded by a metallic disk without significantly affecting the radiation efficiency of the antenna part. The disk, in addition, can be used to tune the frequency of the filter. It was found that the antenna and filter parts of the DRAF can be designed and tuned almost independently. A second-order DRAF is also designed in this paper. As the dual function DRAF is compact and cost effective, it should find applications in modern wireless communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4427323/04427350.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.913152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.913152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of the Dielectric Resonator Antenna as a Filter Element","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric resonator antennas","Resonator filters","Antenna accessories","Frequency","Insertion loss","Dielectric devices","Design methodology","Filtering theory","Antenna theory","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","dielectric resonator antennas","dielectric resonator filters","dielectric-loaded antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric resonator antenna","filter element","return loss","input impedance","radiation patterns","insertion loss","radiation efficiency","wireless communication","multifunction antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","filter","multifunction antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Use of the Dielectric Resonator Antenna as a Filter Element","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4427350/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756523","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of the Dielectric Resonator Antenna as a Filter Element","sourcePdf":"56tap01-lim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095674S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4427323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4427323","articleId":"4427350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4427353,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Manica","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4427323/4427353/4427353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Manica received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in telecommunication engineering both from University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is a member of the ELEDIA Research Group, International Graduate School in Information and Communication Technologies, University of Trento.

The FDTD model employed extends from km below sea level to an altitude of km, and can account for arbitrary horizontal as well as vertical geometrical and electrical inhomogeneities and anisotropies of the ionosphere, lithosphere, and oceans. Using this model, the surface horizontal magnetic field is calculated for different depths and orientations of an electric current occurring below the epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Results show that the alignment and depth of the electric current within the Earth's crust yields significant differences for the calculated surface magnetic field time-waveforms and spectra.

In addition, compared to conventional periodic arrays, these arrays are naturally thinned (i.e., mean inter element spacing is greater than ). The generation of these arrays involves placing array elements at the locations of the vertices of an aperiodic tiling. To obtain a realizable design, the entire array is then scaled and truncated to achieve a desired minimum element spacing and aperture size. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to greatly extend the bandwidth of these arrays by incorporating a simple perturbation scheme into the basic array generation process. The implementation of this perturbation scheme is straightforward and it lends itself well to being combined with an optimization technique such as the genetic algorithm. It is successfully used to generate arrays that have large bandwidths (peak sidelobe level dB with no grating lobes) of up to a minimum element spacing of . Moreover, the flexibility of this technique will be further demonstrated by introducing a slight variation of the basic scheme that is capable of generating arrays with extremely wide bandwidths. An example will be presented for an array design that has a bandwidth corresponding to a minimum element spacing of up to .","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4427323/04427365.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"86","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.913145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.913145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Broadband Planar Arrays Based on the Optimization of Aperiodic Tilings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planar arrays","Design optimization","Fractals","Bandwidth","Genetic algorithms","Gratings","Antenna arrays","Geometry","Turning","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband planar array design","aperiodic tiling optimization","antenna arrays","grating lobe suppression","perturbation scheme","basic array generation process","minimum element spacing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperiodic arrays","aperiodic tilings","broadband arrays","genetic algorithms (GAs)","tiling theory","wideband arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of Broadband Planar Arrays Based on the Optimization of Aperiodic Tilings","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4427365/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742848","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Broadband Planar Arrays Based on the Optimization of Aperiodic Tilings","sourcePdf":"56tap01-spence.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054541S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4427323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4427323","articleId":"4427365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4427366,"authors":[{"name":"Eng Leong Tan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4427323/4427366/4427366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eng Leong Tan (SM'00) received the B.Eng. degree (first class honors) in electrical engineering from the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 1996 and 2000, respectively.","From 1991 to 1992, he was a Research Assistant at the University of Malaya.

Data from session 1 were used to establish an enrolled database, and data from the remaining two sessions were used as test cases. Classification was performed using three different quantitative measures: percent residual difference, correlation coefficient, and a novel distance measure based on wavelet transform. The wavelet distance measure has a classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming the other methods by nearly 10%.

Pesticide is also studied due to its similarities to anthrax. A modified two-beam polarizing interferometer and custom-made sample holders were utilized to obtain the refractive index (RFI), absorption coefficient, complex real and imaginary permittivity, and loss tangent of flour, dry milk, cornstarch, pesticide, baking soda, and talc as a continuous function of frequency in the range of 400-1200 GHz. Dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy was employed to provide phase and amplitude information, leading to the accurate and direct acquisition of the complex RFI and complex dielectric permittivity spectra. It is the first time that such measurements were carried out over such an extended frequency range for common powders to reveal marked variation in absorption and RFI values for different powders. The powders exhibit high-absorption characteristics, and the RFI values lie between 2.4 and 3.4 in this spectral range. A unique resonance signature for talc was detected at 1135 GHz with an associated anomalous dispersion. Parameters such as grain size and orientation were analyzed for their effect on the dielectric properties of powders. Relationships between density, permittivity, and RFI are explored to provide the ability to extrapolate results for other densities. The RFI and the real part of the dielectric permittivity were found to be the most reliable for identification and detection purposes.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.909601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4427371/04427387.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.909601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427371","startPage":"286","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave Dielectric Measurements of Household Powders Using Fourier Transform Spectroscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave Dielectric Measurements of Household Powders Using Fourier Transform Spectroscopy","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 January 2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9756493","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave Dielectric Measurements of Household Powders Using Fourier Transform Spectroscopy","sourcePdf":"57tim02-khan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118159S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","isNumber":"4427371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4427387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4427390,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Massarotto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Public University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain","Dipartimento Elettronica per l'Automazione, Facolt\u00e1 di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Brescia, Brescia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4427371/4427390/4427390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Massarotto was born in Brescia, Italy, in 1977.

Due to the sparseness of the matrices, the solver runs relatively slow. For digital optical tomography (DOT), a large set of linear equations have to be solved which currently takes in the order of hours on desktop computers. Our goal was to speed up the conjugate gradient solver. In this paper we present the results of applying multiple optimization techniques and exploiting multi-core solutions offered by two recently introduced architectures: Intel's Woodcrest general purpose processor and NVIDIA's G80 graphical processing unit. Using these techniques for these architectures, a speedup of a factor three has been achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Computer architecture","Vectors","Memory architecture","Character generation","Parallel processing","Graphics","Bandwidth","Tomography","US Department of Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","mathematics computing","matrix multiplication","multiprocessing systems","optimisation","parallel architectures","sparse matrices","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient algorithm","multicore systems","linear solvers","sparse-matrix vector multiplication","conjugate gradient solver","multiple optimization techniques","Intel Woodcrest general purpose processor","NVIDIA G80 graphical processing unit"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2007.4427436","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427417/4427418/04427436.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2007.4427436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing the conjugate gradient algorithm on multi-core systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementing the conjugate gradient algorithm on multi-core systems","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9774599","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4427436/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing the conjugate gradient algorithm on multi-core systems","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"SOC-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06077S","chronDate":"20-21 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427417","isNumber":"4427418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427417","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4427418","articleId":"4427436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4427439,"authors":[{"name":"Mark P.

A low-complexity length update algorithm is employed to dynamically adjust and optimise the number of taps in the adaptive filter present within the LMMSE receiver according to channel conditions. The results show that the chosen algorithm presents minimal overhead and reduces power consumed due to optimisation of the filter length.

For such applications, hardwired acceleration must be restricted to a minimum subset of kernels, due to the increasing NREs when application update become necessary. Embedded reconfigurable processors, coupling in the same computing engine a general-purpose embedded processor and field-programmable fabrics, provide an appealing trade-off point between pure software and dedicated hardware acceleration. As a case-study, this paper presents the implementation of a set of image processing operators utilized for motion detection on the DREAM adaptive DSP. With respect to pure software solutions, the proposed implementation achieves a performance improvement of 2-3 orders of magnitude, while retaining the same degree of programmability and the same economical perspectives from the end-user point of view of processor-based approaches.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427417/4427418/04427440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSOC.2007.4427440","doi":"10.1109/ISSOC.2007.4427440","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on System-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427440","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart cameras","Embedded computing","Motion detection","Computational intelligence","Image processing","Application software","Acceleration","Video surveillance","Computer applications","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","motion estimation","reconfigurable architectures","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent camera","embedded reconfigurable computing","motion detection","image processing","video surveillance application","computational demanding algorithm","general-purpose embedded reconfigurable processor","field-programmable fabric","DREAM adaptive DSP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427440/","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent cameras and embedded reconfigurable computing: a case-study on motion detection","accessionNumber":"9765709","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4427440/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent cameras and embedded reconfigurable computing: a case-study on motion detection","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"SOC-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039652S","chronDate":"20-21 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427417","isNumber":"4427418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427417","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4427418","articleId":"4427440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4427447,"authors":[{"name":"Girish V.

Following the same sampling criterion that used to define the 424 specimens of the OSA-UCS set, we enlarged such an ensemble by adding 590 samples located in the outer region of the original volume. This allows to overcome the bottleneck in the use of the original color basis for computer vision applications due to lack of saturated colors. The outcomes of a color categorization experiment performed on the extended basis were used to train a discrete color naming model that we have recently proposed. The model was validated through the analysis of its performance for segmenting natural images. Results show that the extended basis removes the inability of the model to deal with saturated colors which significantly improves segmentation results and makes the extended bases exploitable for computer vision applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAPW.2007.41","publicationTitle":"14th International Conference of Image Analysis and Processing - Workshops (ICIAPW 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"14th International Conference of Image Analysis and Processing - Workshops (ICIAPW 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427458/4427459/04427504.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"220","doi":"10.1109/ICIAPW.2007.41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantics Driven Resampling of the OSA-UCS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Semantics Driven Resampling of the OSA-UCS","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4427504/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9894034","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427504/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantics Driven Resampling of the OSA-UCS","confLoc":"Modena, Italy","sourcePdf":"29210216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038923S","chronDate":"10-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427458","isNumber":"4427459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427458","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4427459","articleId":"4427504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4427534,"authors":[{"name":"Changsheng Zhang","affiliation":["College of computer science and Technology, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Changsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085508205"},{"name":"Jigui Sun","affiliation":["College of computer science and Technology, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Jigui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37560366600"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["College of computer science and Technology, Jilin University, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089066267"},{"name":"Qingyun Yang","affiliation":["Changchun Institute of Optics, fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Qingyun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37690925200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3028-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4427534","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Switches","Convergence","Intelligent agent","Conferences","Sun","Educational institutions","Computer science","Physics","Traveling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete particle swarm optimization","traveling salesman problem","premature convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DPSOTSPdiversity indexpremature convergencedepressor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427534","abstract":"An Improved discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO)-based algorithm for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is proposed.

However, because of some inherent shortages, especially chaotic behaviors in the network learning, it is very difficult or impossible to apply the artificial neural network into precise diagnosis of large rotating machinery, such as the diagnosis of unbalance fault, etc. Based on good properties of the Hopfield neural network, a new master-slave neural network model (simply denoted as MSNN) is presented in this paper firstly, whose master network is two Hopfield networks, and the other slave network is a BP network, respectively. After its structure had been innovatively designed, the training algorithm of the MSNN was also discussed simply. At last, the new neural network is applied in the fault diagnosis of some large rotating machinery. By application analyzes and compares, the results show that the master-slave neural network includes more advantages than the BP network, such as a quick asymptotic convergence rate and the smallest network system errors. So, it can successfully be applied in precise diagnosis of large rotating machinery other than BP network.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.34","startPage":"11","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04427658.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Master-Slave Neural Network for Precise Diagnosis of Large Rotating Machinery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427658/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Master-Slave Neural Network for Precise Diagnosis of Large Rotating Machinery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4427658/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9893390","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Master-Slave Neural Network for Precise Diagnosis of Large Rotating Machinery","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"28820011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033222S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427646","isNumber":"4427647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4427647","articleId":"4427658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4427731,"authors":[{"name":"Kuniaki Fujimoto","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, School of Engineering, Kyushu Tokai University, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kuniaki","lastName":"Fujimoto","id":"37403113300"},{"name":"Hirofumi Sasaki","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, School of Engineering, Kyushu Tokai University, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"37398964200"},{"name":"Ren-Qi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, School of Engineering, Kyushu Tokai University, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Ren-Qi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37833266000"},{"name":"Yan Shi","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, School of Engineering, Kyushu Tokai University, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37276886600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4427731","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Hardware","Inference algorithms","Real time systems","Application software","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Circuit optimization","Information systems","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","logic gates","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuro-fuzzy learning algorithm","bit shift operation","NOT operations","real-time systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427731","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04427731.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuro-Fuzzy, Chaos Applications A Study of Neuro-fuzzy Learning Algorithm for Hardware Implementation","abstract":"This paper presents a novel neuro-fuzzy learning algorithm, which has a high learning ability and a high-speed processing.

In this paper, an adaptive learning network is proposed as a kind of neural-fuzzy GMDH. The proposed method can be reinterpreted as a multi-stage fuzzy decision rule which is called as the neural-fuzzy GMDH.

In light-emitting diode (LED) manufacturing, each die on the LED wafer must be inspected to determine whether it has defects or not. Therefore, detection of defective regions is a significant issue to discuss. In this paper, a new approach for inspection of LED wafer defects using the learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network is presented. In the wafer image, each die image and the region of interest (ROI) in them to handle can be acquired. Then, by analyzing the properties of every ROI, we can extract specific geometric features and texture features. Using these features, the LVQ neural network is presented to classify these dies as either acceptable or not.

Conventional wafer inspection was usually performed by human visual judgment. A large number of people visually examine wafers and hand-mark the defective regions. As a result, potential misjudgment may be introduced due to human fatigue. Besides, traditional method bring out a considerable personnel cost. In order to solve these shortcomings, our research intends to develop an automatic inspection system, which recognizes defective patterns automatically. The radial basis function (RBF) neural network was adopted for inspection processing. Actual data obtained from a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan were used in experiments. The results show the proposed RBF neural network successfully identifies the defective dies on LED wafers images with good performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.471","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04427875.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"230","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for LED Wafer Defect Inspection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for LED Wafer Defect Inspection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9893607","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4427875/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for LED Wafer Defect Inspection","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"28820230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052436S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427646","isNumber":"4427647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427646","xplore-issue":"4427647","articleId":"4427875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4427880,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Fa Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Fa","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37693147300"},{"name":"Tsung-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Han","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37271381400"},{"name":"Chih-Hung Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hung","lastName":"Lai","id":"37691722100"},{"name":"Shu-Chung Yi","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Integrated Circuit Design, National Changhua University of Education, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Chung","lastName":"Yi","id":"37689007700"},{"name":"Mao-Hsu Yen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mao-Hsu","lastName":"Yen","id":"37312405700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4427880","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Convolution","Wavelet transforms","Filter bank","Clocks","Very large scale integration","Hardware design languages","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","real-time platform","VLSI architecture","discrete wavelet transform","Verilog HDI","CMOS image sensor"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel, efficient VLSI architecture for the implementation of one-dimension, lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

We compute the average of entropy of two sequences and then assign the weights to count, RPD and APD according to the weight table which is pointed by the variant of entropy of two sequences. The weight tables are then adjusted by genetic algorithms. Experiment shows that such adaptive weight distance mechanism helps reflect the distance between sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.369","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04427940.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","startPage":"295","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Weight Assignment in Distance Function for Biological Sequence Feature Vector by Genetic Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning Weight Assignment in Distance Function for Biological Sequence Feature Vector by Genetic Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4427940/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9893671","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4427940/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Weight Assignment in Distance Function for Biological Sequence Feature Vector by Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"28820295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056858S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427646","isNumber":"4427647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427646","xplore-issue":"4427647","articleId":"4427940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4427960,"authors":[{"name":"Akihiro Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Sasebo National College of Technology, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Sakaguchi","id":"37295281500"},{"name":"Shinnosuke Mori","affiliation":["Ehime University, Ehime, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinnosuke","lastName":"Mori","id":"37285875200"},{"name":"Toru Yamamoto","affiliation":["Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Toru","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37280377100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4427960","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-term control","Helicopters","Humans","Control systems","Manufacturing industries","Learning systems","Design methodology","Neural networks","Databases","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","control system synthesis","helicopters","nonlinear control systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven skill","PID control","pilot-scale helicopter model","human skill representation","controller design","data-driven control","local modeling","nonlinear model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4427960","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04427960.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Skill-Based PID Control of a Pilot-Scale Helicopter Model","abstract":"Lots of works for representing human skills which are cultivated in long experiences have been reported.

Different than the previous approaches of using multiple SISO decoders to process sub-block MAP decoding in parallel, the new parallel turbo decoder immediately passes the extrinsic information of each message bit which is generated by one SISO decoder to the other SISO decoders bit by bit. Thus, the component decoders corresponding to different received sequence perform in parallel and the interleaver delay is eliminated. Simulation results show that with this parallel scheme, decoding time is halved while the performance in terms of BER is comparable, and in some cases superior, to the general turbo decoder.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.73","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04428028.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Decoder Design for Low Latency Turbo Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Decoder Design for Low Latency Turbo Decoding","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9893758","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428028/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Decoder Design for Low Latency Turbo Decoding","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"28820386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053247S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427646","isNumber":"4427647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427646","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4427647","articleId":"4428028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4428032,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Fang Chang","affiliation":["National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jui-Fang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37406505000"},{"name":"Shu-Wei Hsu","affiliation":["National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Wei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37825431300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4428032","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428032","abstract":"Making profit based on historical data is one of the most important problems in the study of financial markets.

The results show that the PSO algorithm is effective in making better returns of portfolios.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.568","startPage":"390","endPage":"390","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04428032.pdf","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Construction of Stock_s Portfolios by Using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Portfolios","Particle swarm optimization","Investments","Mutual funds","Disaster management","Genetic algorithms","Power system security","Power system dynamics","Pricing","Animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["investment","particle swarm optimisation","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stock portfolios","particle swarm optimization","historical data","financial markets","equity fund","investment capitals","Taiwan weighted stock index"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Construction of Stock_s Portfolios by Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9893762","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Construction of Stock_s Portfolios by Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"28820390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055431S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427646","isNumber":"4427647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427646","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4427647","articleId":"4428032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4428039,"authors":[{"name":"Hsu-Hwa Chang","affiliation":["National Taipei College of Business, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsu-Hwa","lastName":"Chang","id":"37835979500"},{"name":"Teng-Yi Huang","affiliation":["National Taipei College of Business, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Teng-Yi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37830841700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4428039","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Artificial neural networks","US Department of Energy","Equations","Educational institutions","Lattices","Petroleum","Design optimization","Data mining","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design of experiments","neural nets","product design","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixture experiment design","artificial neural network","electromagnetism-like mechanism algorithm","response function model","mixed ingredient proportion","fitness value","optimal ingredients proportion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428039","abstract":"A mixture experiment treats a product that is formed of several ingredients together (e.g. gasoline, detergents, and cookies). A mixture experiment is a special type of parameter in which the factors are the ingredients or components of a mixture. Although there have many researchers proposed various methods to improve the design of the mixture experiments, those cannot provide effective analysis. This study aims to use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) algorithm to optimizing the mixture design. First, we employ an ANN to build the response function model (RFM) of the experiment for estimating the response at specific mixed ingredient proportions. An EM algorithm is then used to obtain the fitness value of the response function and the optimal ingredients proportion within the constraints of ingredients. An example adopted from the literature is re-analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.389","startPage":"397","endPage":"397","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04428039.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixture Experiment Design Using Artificial Neural Networks and Electromagnetism-like Mechanism Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428039/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mixture Experiment Design Using Artificial Neural Networks and Electromagnetism-like Mechanism Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428039/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9893769","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixture Experiment Design Using Artificial Neural Networks and Electromagnetism-like Mechanism Algorithm","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"28820397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039432S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427646","isNumber":"4427647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4427647","articleId":"4428039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":4428061,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Li","affiliation":["Dalian Univ. of Technol., Dalian"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Li","id":"37716566900"},{"name":"Weiling Su","affiliation":["E-Business & Logistic Institute, Dalian University, Dalian, P.R.China, 116622"],"firstName":"Weiling","lastName":"Su","id":"37088458268"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4428061","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Linear programming","Computational modeling","Plants (biology)","Biomimetics","Fractals","Light sources","Biological system modeling","Systems engineering and theory","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","finite element analysis","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plant growth simulation algorithm","finite element method","global optimization","integer programming","bionics random algorithm","plant phototropism characterization","growth probability","power model simulating plant"]}],"abstract":"Plant growth simulation algorithm aiming at the global optimization of integer programming is a kind of bionics random algorithm that occurs in nature.

A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed criteria.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2007.503","startPage":"556","endPage":"556","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2007.503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4427647","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Innovative Computing, Informatio and Control (ICICIC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4427646/4427647/04428198.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Stability Criteria for Uncertain Stochastic Cellular Neural Networks with Time Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428198/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Stability Criteria for Uncertain Stochastic Cellular Neural Networks with Time Delays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428198/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9893928","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Stability Criteria for Uncertain Stochastic Cellular Neural Networks with Time Delays","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"28820556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063555S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4427646","isNumber":"4427647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4427646","xplore-issue":"4427647","articleId":"4428198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4428204,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Rao","affiliation":["Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, CN"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Rao","id":"38666958800"},{"name":"Ming-fu Fu","firstName":"Ming-fu","lastName":"Fu","id":"37650703900"},{"name":"Lian Chen","firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37087929584"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4428204","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Polynomials","Neurons","Computer networks","Linear regression","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","MATLAB","Dispersion","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","mathematics computing","neural nets","polynomials","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation neural network structure optimization","polynomial regression","streamlined network structure design","neural network generalization","self-configuration algorithm","nonlinear problem","linear regression theory basis","MATLAB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428204","abstract":"To design a streamlined network structure is a commonly used method for BP neural network to guarantee the neural network's generalization.

Using these two measures as two objective functions, the MOPs is finally converted into a two objective optimization problem. For the transformed problem, a novel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The new approach is tested on two well-known benchmark multiobjective optimization functions taken from the standard literature. Compared with other eight state- of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm remarkably outperforms them in terms of the quality of the solutions and the uniformly distribution of the solutions.

Therefore, the injected power level causing a malfunction of an integrated circuit, according to a given criterion, can be identified and predicted at any frequency up to 1 GHz.

An analytical formulation has been obtained, which allows a better understanding of the shape of the output phase-noise spectrum of these circuits. The simplicity of this formulation is also helpful for circuit design. Approximate expressions for the corner frequencies of the spectrum are determined, identifying the most influential magnitudes and deriving design criteria. In particular, a technique has been developed to shift the frequency of the first corner of the phase-noise spectrum, up to which the output phase noise follows the input one. The expressions for the corner frequencies can be introduced in either in-house or commercial harmonic-balance software, thus allowing an agile design, as no separate phase-noise analysis is required. The validity of the analytical techniques is verified with the conversion-matrix approach and with measurements using two field-effect-transistor-based circuits: a 4.9-GHz injection-locked oscillator and a frequency divider by 2 with 9.8-GHz input frequency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Noise Analysis of Injection-Locked Oscillators and Analog Frequency Dividers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.914375","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4446042/04428280.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.914375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Noise Analysis of Injection-Locked Oscillators and Analog Frequency Dividers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4428280/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748460","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Noise Analysis of Injection-Locked Oscillators and Analog Frequency Dividers","sourcePdf":"56tmtt02-ramirez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157712S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4446042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4446042","articleId":"4428280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4428281,"authors":[{"name":"Toshihiro Togashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4446042/4428281/4428281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Toshihiro Togashi was born in Aomori, Japan, in July 1981.

Rather than utilize an \"echo control\" as proposed by others, which requires instrumentation of the sound-side leg, the proposed approach infers user intent based on the characteristic shape of the force and moment vector of interaction between the user and prosthesis. The real-time intent recognition approach utilizes a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with majority voting and threshold biasing schemes to increase its robustness. The ability of the approach to recognize in real time a person's intent to stand or walk at one of three different speeds is demonstrated on measured biomechanics data.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428400","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428400.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time Intent Recognition for a Powered Knee and Ankle Transfemoral Prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428400/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time Intent Recognition for a Powered Knee and Ankle Transfemoral Prosthesis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9813085","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428400/","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time Intent Recognition for a Powered Knee and Ankle Transfemoral Prosthesis","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06903S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4428419,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Berselli","affiliation":["DIEM, Mech Engineering Department, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Berselli","id":"37546397800"},{"name":"Riccardo Falconi","affiliation":["DEIS, Department of Electronics,  Computer Science and Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Falconi","id":"37546413600"},{"name":"Gabriele Vassura","affiliation":["DIEM, Mech Engineering Department, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Vassura","id":"37283148000"},{"name":"Giovanni Carlo Modugno","affiliation":["DISCA, Faculty of Medicine, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni Carlo","lastName":"Modugno","id":"37841285000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1319-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1320-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7898"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-7901"}],"articleNumber":"4428419","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","Robot sensing systems","Ear","Pathology","Irrigation","Angular velocity","Medical treatment","Robotics and automation","Topology","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ear","medical robotics","patient treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vestibular lithiasis","inner ear","serial robot","Denavit-Hartenberg parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Task based design","BPPV","discrete optimization techniques","data structure","inverse kinematic","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428419","abstract":"Benign Paroxymal Positional Vertigo and variants, collectively called \"vestibular lithiasis\", designate a common disorder caused by a malfunction of the inner ear. These pathologies are connected with the presence of dense particles within the semicircular canals which interfere with the sensing capabilities of angular velocity in the patient, causing nystagmus and vertigo. Some of these conditions can be treated by repositioning maneuvers physically done by the doctor that moves the head of the patient along different poses in space. Despite the fact that the treatment shows a success rate up to 80-90%, the failure rate remains highly significant and it is proven that precision repeatability and unlimited 360deg manoeuvrability can improve diagnostic and treatment potential for overcoming this kind of vertigo. In this paper the kinematic design of a serial robot that will execute repositioning maneuvers automatically is performed through a simplified task based kinematic design technique. The aim of the method is to find the minimum number of degrees of freedom to carry out a set of given tasks as well as the manipulator's topology and the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. The proposed procedure firstly minimizes the number of degrees of freedom only and then a cost function connected to the total link length.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428419","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428419.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Based Kinematic Design of a Serial Robot for the Treatment of Vestibular Lithiasis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Task Based Kinematic Design of a Serial Robot for the Treatment of Vestibular Lithiasis","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428419/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9871543","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Based Kinematic Design of a Serial Robot for the Treatment of Vestibular Lithiasis","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065234S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4428432,"authors":[{"name":"H.

One of the main hurdles that hinder such a development is the challenge of building an ankle-foot prosthesis that matches the size and weight of the intact ankle, but still provides a sufficiently large instantaneous power output and torque to propel an amputee. In this paper, we present a novel, powered ankle-foot prosthesis that overcomes these design challenges. The prosthesis comprises an unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. With this architecture, the ankle-foot prosthesis matches the size and weight of the human ankle, and is shown to be satisfying the restrictive design specifications dictated by normal human ankle walking biomechanics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biomechanical Design of a Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428441","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428441.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Biomechanical Design of a Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428441/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9871550","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biomechanical Design of a Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134301S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4428456,"authors":[{"name":"Sai K.

However, this shared control usually provides assistance to the user in a constant and identical manner each time. Creating an adaptive level of assistance, thereby complementing the user's capabilities at any moment, would be more appropriate. The better the user can do by himself, the less assistance he receives from the shared control system; and vice versa. In order to do this, we need to be able to detect when and in what way the user needs assistance. An appropriate assisting behaviour would then be activated for the time the user requires help, thereby adapting the level of assistance to the specific situation. This paper presents such a system, helping a brain-computer interface (BCI) subject perform goal-directed navigation of a simulated wheelchair in an adaptive manner. Whenever the subject has more difficulties in driving the wheelchair, more assistance will be given. Experimental results of two subjects show that this adaptive shared control increases the task performance. Also, it shows that a subject with a lower BCI performance has more need for extra assistance in difficult situations, such as manoeuvring in a narrow corridor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Brain modeling","Wheelchairs","Mobile robots","Robot control","Humans","Control systems","Brain computer interfaces","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","handicapped aids","man-machine systems","medical control systems","neurophysiology","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive shared control","brain actuated simulated wheelchair","brain signal controlled robotic assistant","human brain signals","brain-computer interface","goal directed navigation task"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428457","startPage":"408","endPage":"414","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428457.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Shared Control of a Brain-Actuated Simulated Wheelchair","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Shared Control of a Brain-Actuated Simulated Wheelchair","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9871556","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4428457/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Shared Control of a Brain-Actuated Simulated Wheelchair","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046745S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4428476,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Arvetti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Arvetti","id":"37828953300"},{"name":"Giuseppina Gini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppina","lastName":"Gini","id":"37294168800"},{"name":"Michele Folgheraiter","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Folgheraiter","id":"37294171700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1319-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1320-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7898"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-7901"}],"articleNumber":"4428476","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":650},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Wavelet analysis","Signal analysis","Neural networks","Neural prosthesis","Grippers","Muscles","Fingers","Electrodes","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","biomechanics","electromyography","medical control systems","medical signal processing","motion control","neural nets","prosthetics","signal classification","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMG signal classification","wavelet analysis","neural networks","active hand prosthesis","electromyographic signals","1 DOF motion","gripper"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428476","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428476.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","startPage":"531","endPage":"536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of EMG signals through wavelet analysis and neural networks for controlling an active hand prosthesis","abstract":"In order to increase the effectiveness of active hand prostheses we intend to exploit electromyographic (EMG) signals more than in the usual application for controlling one degree of freedom (gripper open or closed).

The new method of Complementary Limb Motion Estimation (CLME) analyzes dependencies among human Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) in healthy subjects. Based on this knowledge, adequate motion for inoperable DoFs in patients is estimated on-line from sound limb motion. Thus, the intention of a partially paralyzed person or an amputee can be deduced from residual body motion, in order to coordinately actuate or supervise the impaired limbs. The aim is to increase the dominance of the patient and to reduce the robot to an assistive device. In continuity of priorly published evaluation by comuter simulations, this paper presents a first experimental proof of concept of CLME with healthy subjects. The results of these preliminary tests affirm the suitability of the algorithm for cooperative human-robot interaction.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428516","startPage":"798","endPage":"803","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428516.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complementary Limb Motion Estimation based on Interjoint Coordination: Experimental Evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Rehabilitation robotics","Motion control","Robot kinematics","Open loop systems","Humans","Medical treatment","Leg","Legged locomotion","Intelligent robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","handicapped aids","medical robotics","orthotics","patient rehabilitation","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complementary limb motion estimation","interjoint coordination","motor rehabilitation","hemiplegic patients","motorized orthoses","intelligent prosthetics","robotically assisted limbs","cooperative human-robot interaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Complementary Limb Motion Estimation based on Interjoint Coordination: Experimental Evaluation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428516/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9826207","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary Limb Motion Estimation based on Interjoint Coordination: Experimental Evaluation","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058695S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4428519,"authors":[{"name":"Arno H.A.

As an alternative to the functional approach mimicking activities of daily living, targeted force-coordination training may also have its benefits. Our passive exoskeleton, the Dampace, has controlled braking on the three rotational axes of the shoulder and one of the elbow. It is designed to combine functional training of activities of daily living with force-coordination training. The Dampace exoskeleton can assist in identifying causes behind the movement disorders of stroke patients, tackle these causes with isolated force-coordination training, possibly simultaneously over multiple joints, and then integrate the isolated training back into a functional, task-specific training protocol. Not needing to align the Dampace axes to the human shoulder and elbow axes overcome some of the difficulties traditionally associated with exoskeletons. Although it adds more complexity, the reduction of setup times to a few minutes and the absence of static reaction forces in the human joints, are major advantages and have been well received by therapists and physicians. Controlled braking instead of actively assisting actuators, has the advantage of inherent safety and always actively participating patients, at the cost of not being able to assist movements or create all virtual environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dampace: dynamic force-coordination trainer for the upper extremities","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428519","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428519.pdf","startPage":"820","endPage":"826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dampace: dynamic force-coordination trainer for the upper extremities","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428519/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9826210","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dampace: dynamic force-coordination trainer for the upper extremities","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091155S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4428522,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Most devices control complete joint trajectories and assume symmetry between both legs by either a position or an impedance control. However we believe that the control should not be on a joint level but on a subtask level (i.e. foot clearance, balance control). To this end we have chosen for virtual model control(VMC) to define a set of controllers that can assist in each of these tasks. Thus enabling the exoskeleton to offer selective support and evaluation of each substask during rehabilitation training. The aim of this explorative pilot study was to assess the performance of a VMC of the step height and to assess if selective control of the step height left the remaining of the walking pattern unaffected. Four young healthy subjects walked on a treadmill with their legs and pelvis attached to the lopes exoskeleton in 3 different conditions: (1) providing minimal resistance, (2) control of the left step height with a low stiffness (3) control of the step height with a large stiffness. We have shown that it is possible to exert a vertical forces for the support of foot clearance during the swing phase. The higher stiffness of the VMC resulted in a greater change of the step height, which was achieved by a larger increase of the maximal hip and knee flexion compared to the low stiffness condition. The control of the step height resulted in minor changes in the cycle time and swing time. The joint angles also showed only minor changes. The preliminary results suggest that we were able to control a subtask of walking, while leaving the remaining walking trajectory largely unaffected. In the near future, control of other subtask will be implemented and evaluated in isolation and in conjunction with each other.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428522","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428522.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective control of a subtask of walking in a robotic gait trainer(LOPES)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Selective control of a subtask of walking in a robotic gait trainer(LOPES)","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9826212","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428522/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective control of a subtask of walking in a robotic gait trainer(LOPES)","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088241S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4428530,"authors":[{"name":"T.T.

While mass practice of movement has shown promise for rehabilitation, initial impairment of the hand may be too severe to permit even approximations of the desired movement. To facilitate movement, especially of pinch, we are building an exoskeleton to permit independent actuation of each of the three joints of the index finger. Separate actuators are used for flexion and extension, with closed-loop control of either force or position. In the future, a companion thumb exoskeleton will be developed to permit coordinated performance of pinch. This system will be used to assess strategies for optimizing rehabilitation of pinch and reach-to-pinch following stroke. The design of the actuated index finger exoskeleton is presented here.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428530","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","startPage":"896","endPage":"901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428530.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingers","Exoskeletons","Robot sensing systems","Rehabilitation robotics","Extremities","Mechanical engineering","Force control","Neuromuscular","Laboratories","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","biomechanics","force control","medical control systems","patient rehabilitation","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuated finger exoskeleton","hand rehabilitation","stroke","chronic hand impairment","actuators","flexion","extension","closed-loop control","force control","position control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Actuated Finger Exoskeleton for Hand Rehabilitation Following Stroke","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428530/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428530/","accessionNumber":"9826218","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Actuated Finger Exoskeleton for Hand Rehabilitation Following Stroke","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150549S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4428531,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Fite","affiliation":["Member, IEEE"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Fite","id":"37281515400"},{"name":"Jason Mitchell","firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Mitchell","id":"37289453900"},{"name":"Frank Sup","affiliation":["Member, IEEE"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Sup","id":"37596693500"},{"name":"Michael Goldfarb","affiliation":["Member, IEEE"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Goldfarb","id":"37284476400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1319-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1320-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7898"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-7901"}],"articleNumber":"4428531","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":44,"totalDownloads":1411},"abstract":"This paper describes the design and control of a transfemoral prosthesis with an electrically powered knee joint.

There are some critical parameters which determine the dynamic performance of robot manipulators. While the correlations between these parameters are complex and highly non-linear, deciding on these parameters to optimize the dynamic performance of manipulators is a difficult and time-consuming task, especially in the early conceptual design phase. The gearbox size and the lengths of the arms are parameters that have a large impact on the performance and the cost of robots. In order to perform optimization, a mathematical programming model is developed. An objective function is defined to determine optimal gearboxes and arm lengths from an acceleration capability perspective. The arm lengths are treated as continuous variables whereas the gearboxes are selected from a list of available units. This paper presents a Genetic algorithm procedure which shows how optimization can be used in the early phases of a development process in order to evaluate the potential of a concept. This study considers a three degree of freedom robot. The mathematical model is coded in the C language and optimized using the genetic algorithm. Comparison of the obtained results with optimum values based on complex algorithm , clearly shows the advantages of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428565","startPage":"1129","endPage":"1135","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2007.4428565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428349","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428348/4428349/04428565.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm to Optimum Dynamic Performance of Industrial Robots in the Conceptual Design Phase","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428565/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm to Optimum Dynamic Performance of Industrial Robots in the Conceptual Design Phase","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428565/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9826255","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm to Optimum Dynamic Performance of Industrial Robots in the Conceptual Design Phase","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"ICCOR-00-216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083318S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428348","isNumber":"4428349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428348","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4428349","articleId":"4428565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4428579,"authors":[{"name":"Theodore W.

In these applications, autonomous navigation methods allow a mobile robot to explore an environment independent of human presence or intervention. The mobile robot contains the measurement device and records the data then either transmits it or brings it back to the operator. Sensors are required for the robot to detect obstacles in the navigation environment, and machine intelligence is required for the robot to plan a path around these obstacles. The use of genetic algorithms is an example of machine intelligence applications to modern robot navigation. Genetic algorithms are heuristic optimization methods, which have mechanisms analogous to biological evolution.

Given a network domain, the fundamental issue in placing MRs is to find the minimal configuration of MRs so as to satisfy the network coverage, connectivity, and Internet traffic demand. In this paper, the problem is addressed under a constraint network model in which the traffic demand is non-uniformly distributed and the candidate positions for MRs are pre-decided. After formulating the MR placement problem, we first provide the theoretical analysis to validate the traffic demand and determine the optimal position of Internet gateway (IGW). To reduce complexity of determining the locations of MRs while satisfying the traffic constraint, we propose an effective heuristic algorithm to obtain an close-to-optimal solution. Finally, our simulation results verify our analytical model and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428616","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428592","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428591/4428592/04428616.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Mesh Router Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428616/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Mesh Router Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428616/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9859954","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Mesh Router Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086598S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428591","isNumber":"4428592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428591","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"4428592","articleId":"4428616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4428622,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.M.

However, their reported accuracy fall short of their counterparts. In this paper, we investigate many aspects of fingerprint-based location systems in order to enhance their accuracy. First, we derive analytically a robust location fingerprint definition, and then verify it experimentally as well. We also devise a way to facilitate under-trained location systems through simple linear regression technique. This technique reduces the training time and effort, and can be particularly useful when the surrounding or setup of the localization area changes. We further show experimentally that because of the positions of some access points or the environmental factors around them, their signal strength correlates nicely with distance. We argue that it would be more beneficial to give special consideration to these access points for location computation, owing to their ability to distinguish locations distinctly in signal space. The probability of encountering such access points will be even higher when we denote a location's signature using the signals of multiple wireless technologies collectively. We present the results of two well- known localization algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbor and Bayesian Probabilistic Model) when the above factors are exploited, using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals. We have observed significant improvement in their accuracy when our ideas are implemented.","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428622","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428591/4428592/04428622.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428592","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Localization Using Multiple Wireless Technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Localization Using Multiple Wireless Technologies","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428622/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9859955","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4428622/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Localization Using Multiple Wireless Technologies","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109544S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428591","isNumber":"4428592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428591","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4428592","articleId":"4428622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4428636,"authors":[{"name":"Sumit Gupta","affiliation":["Department ofComputer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37834176300"},{"name":"Rong Zheng","affiliation":["Department ofComputer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37285841600"},{"name":"Albert M.

Upon the occurrence of a physical phenomenon, network nodes relocate themselves so as to properly sample and control the event, while maintaining the network connectivity. Then, as soon as the event ends, all nodes return to the monitoring configuration.

Wireless networks, with their rapidly changing network conditions also create a need to revisit this issue. This paper uses measurements in a wired bio-inspired adaptive network test-bed, the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN), to investigate the pros and cons of adaptive routing. CPN routes packet flows through a store and forward network according to their Quality of Service (QoS) needs through an on-line, distributed reinforcement learning mechanism that incorporates a biologically-inspired Neural Network model for making routing decisions. This paper investigates routing oscillations which occur due to the interaction of multiple flows and studies their effect on QoS in the context of CPN. Our results indicate that routing oscillations can be easily controlled by randomising the route switching, and that from an overall QoS viewpoint increased switching can also lead to improved performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oscillations in a Bio-Inspired Routing Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428681","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428591/4428592/04428681.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Oscillations in a Bio-Inspired Routing Algorithm","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428681/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillations in a Bio-Inspired Routing Algorithm","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043157S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428591","isNumber":"4428592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428591","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4428592","articleId":"4428681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4428683,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Loukas","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Loukas","id":"37423875400"},{"name":"Gulay Oke","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Gulay","lastName":"Oke","id":"37707509400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1455-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"4428683","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Detectors","Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Biology computing","Communication networks","Bayesian methods","Decision making","Neurons","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","neural nets","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biologically inspired denial of service detector","random neural network","denial of service networking attacks","Bayesian decision making","random spiking behaviour","biological neurons","network traffic","likelihood estimation","CPN networking protocol"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428683","abstract":"Several of today's computing challenges have been met by resorting to and adapting optimal solutions that have evolved in nature. For example, autonomic communication networks have started applying biologically-inspired methods to achieve some of their self-* properties. We build upon such methods to solve the recent problem of detection of denial of service networking attacks, by proposing a combination of Bayesian decision making and the random neural networks (RNN) which are inspired by the random spiking behaviour of the biological neurons. Our approach is based on measuring various instantaneous and statistical variables describing the incoming network traffic, acquiring a likelihood estimation and fusing the information gathered from the individual input features using different architectures of the RNN. The experiments are conducted using the CPN networking protocol which is also based on the RNN.","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428683","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428591/4428592/04428683.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Biologically Inspired pired Denial of Service Detector Using the Random Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Biologically Inspired pired Denial of Service Detector Using the Random Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9859993","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4428683/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Biologically Inspired pired Denial of Service Detector Using the Random Neural Network","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062502S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428591","isNumber":"4428592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428591","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4428592","articleId":"4428683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4428700,"authors":[{"name":"Cesare Alippi","affiliation":["Dip. di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Cesare","lastName":"Alippi","id":"37279180000"},{"name":"Giuseppe Anastasi","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Anastasi","id":"37282198200"},{"name":"Cristian Galperti","affiliation":["Dip. di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Galperti","id":"37295877400"},{"name":"Francesca Mancini","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Mancini","id":"37823483100"},{"name":"Manuel Roveri","affiliation":["Dip. di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Roveri","id":"37272856300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1455-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"4428700","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":550},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Energy conservation","Wireless sensor networks","Snow","Monitoring","Energy consumption","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Frequency estimation","Base stations","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","intelligent sensors","snow","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","adaptive sampling","energy conservation","snow monitoring","embedded sensor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428700","abstract":"Energy conservation techniques for sensor networks typically rely on the assumption that data sensing and processing consume considerable less energy than communication. This assumption does not hold in some practical application scenarios, where ad hoc developed sensor units require power consumption comparable with, or even larger than, that of the radio. In this paper we focus on an embedded sensor for monitoring snow composition in mountain slopes for avalanche forecasting. To lower the sensor energy consumption we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm able to dynamically estimate the optimal sampling frequency of the signal to be monitored. In turn, this minimizes the activity of both the sensor and the radio (hence saving energy) while maintaining an acceptable accuracy on the acquired data. Simulation experiments show that the suggested solution can save up to 97% of the energy consumed for sensing when the sensor is always on, while maintaining the error at acceptable levels.","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428700","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428591/4428592/04428700.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sampling for Energy Conservation in Wireless Sensor Networks for Snow Monitoring Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sampling for Energy Conservation in Wireless Sensor Networks for Snow Monitoring Applications","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4428700/","accessionNumber":"9824432","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428700/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sampling for Energy Conservation in Wireless Sensor Networks for Snow Monitoring Applications","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047365S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428591","isNumber":"4428592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428591","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4428592","articleId":"4428700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4428702,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hefeeda","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hefeeda","id":"37295054700"},{"name":"Majid Bagheri","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Bagheri","id":"37689287700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1455-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"4428702","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1739},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Fires","Sensor systems","Costs","Humans","Forestry","Surveillance","Large-scale systems","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Lightning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forestry","telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","forest fires early detection","fire weather index system","North America","forestry research","sensor manufacturers","k-coverage problem","data aggregation scheme","network lifetime"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428702","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428702","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","abstract":"We present the design and evaluation of a wireless sensor network for early detection of forest fires. We first present the key aspects in modeling forest fires. We do this by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, and show how its different components can be used in designing efficient fire detection systems. The FWI System is one of the most comprehensive forest fire danger rating systems in North America, and it is backed by several decades of forestry research. The analysis of the FWI System could be of interest in its own right to researchers working in the sensor network area and to sensor manufacturers who can optimize the communication and sensing modules of their products to better fit forest fire detection systems. Then, we model the forest fire detection problem as a k-coverage problem in wireless sensor networks. In addition, we present a simple data aggregation scheme based on the FWI System. This data aggregation scheme significantly prolongs the network lifetime, because it only delivers the data that is of interest to the application. We validate several aspects of our design using simulation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428592","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428591/4428592/04428702.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Sensor Networks for Early Detection of Forest Fires","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4428702/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Sensor Networks for Early Detection of Forest Fires","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824431","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Sensor Networks for Early Detection of Forest Fires","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044825S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428591","isNumber":"4428592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428591","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4428592","articleId":"4428702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4428726,"authors":[{"name":"Beatrice Pietrarca","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Beatrice","lastName":"Pietrarca","id":"37696134200"},{"name":"Giovanni Sasso","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Sasso","id":"37665462800"},{"name":"Gian Paolo Perrucci","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Gian Paolo","lastName":"Perrucci","id":"37296313700"},{"name":"Frank H.P.

Next-generation mobile communication systems also plan to adopt orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology for multi-user scenario, in which subcarriers can be grouped as resource blocks or subchannels and allocated to different users. Hence, only partial subcarriers in one OFDM symbol may be used by one user end (UE). In this situation, more (a) Partial FFT algorithm (b) Cached-FFT algorithm redundant power consumption is produced by the complete FFT computation for OFDM demodulation in the UE. Among the available FFT architectures, cached-FFT has much regularity and lower power consumption than others. Thus, a partial FFT algorithm can be applied to the cached-FFT architecture for power reduction of OFDMA UE. In this paper, a partial cached-FFT algorithm is proposed to control the operation of the cached-FFT processor for different proposals of OFDMA resource block allocation schemes, thereby reducing the computing power.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4428800","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04428800.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4428800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial cached-FFT algorithm for OFDMA communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial cached-FFT algorithm for OFDMA communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428800/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9822761","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4428800/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial cached-FFT algorithm for OFDMA communications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4428800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043942S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4428800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4428838,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wei Peng","id":"37398569900"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Shaodan Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Tung Sang Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tung Sang Ng","id":"37280168200"},{"name":"Jiang Zhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of electronics, University of Kent, UK"],"lastName":"Jiang Zhou Wang","id":"37280544800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1271-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4428838","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational complexity","Computer simulation","Iterative algorithms","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Maximum likelihood detection","Constellation diagram","Euclidean distance","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QRM-ML detection","candidate selection","MIMO multiplexing systems","QR decomposition associated M algorithm","maximum-likelihood detection","multiple input multiple output multiplexing systems","transmitted signal","squared Euclidean distance calculation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an improved QR decomposition associated M algorithm for maximum-likelihood detection (QRM-ML) with candidate selection in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) multiplexing systems.

The proposed fast global elimination algorithm (FGEA) can skip unnecessary search positions by the preprocessing unit. We employ the preprocessing unit to calculate the sub-sampled sum of subblock absolute difference (sub-sampled SSAD) for each candidate macro-block (MB) in the search range, where the preprocessing can select a number of probable candidate motion blocks. Then we calculate the sum of absolute difference (SAD) from these selected candidate blocks and find out the final motion vector. The proposed FGEA which uses the sub-sampled skill, reduces the computation cost of preprocessing and maintains the same compensated video quality in comparison with the previous GEA, which almost provides the same quality as the well-known full search block matching algorithm (FSBMA). Software simulation results show that the proposed fast block matching motion estimation algorithm can reduce about 38% absolute difference (AD) costs and perform average 1.64 runtime faster than the previous GEA method on the basis of the same compensated video quality with the FSBMA Through VLSI implementations, the realization of the FGEA only needs 22.1 k gate counts to achieve real-time process 30 frames/sec CIF-format video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4428873","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04428873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4428873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast global elimination algorithm and low-cost VLSI design for motion estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast global elimination algorithm and low-cost VLSI design for motion estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4428873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9822834","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4428873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast global elimination algorithm and low-cost VLSI design for motion estimation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12062007-000103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047402S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4428873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4428894,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Rieger","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Rieger","id":"37272222000"},{"name":"Yen-Yow Pan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Yow Pan","id":"37087484983"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1271-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4428894","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Voltage","Electrodes","Feedback","Cutoff frequency","Information filtering","Information filters","Dynamic range","Electrocardiography","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosignal amplifier system","very-large dynamic-range","high-gain amplification","high-gain system","time-varying offset voltages"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4428894","abstract":"The recording of small signals such as body potentials requires high-gain amplification.

Binary wavelet transform was adopted to detect power quality disturbance based on wavelet transform local modulus maximum theory, which corresponding to the singular point of power quality disturbance signal and can be used to detect disturbance.

With a SSNR maximization criterion, the MSSNR TEQ method is one attractive method with its supreme performance. However, the MSSNR method suffers from high computation complexity when employing the TEQ with long taps. We first demonstrate the MSSNR method and the Steiglitz McBride method for translating the prescribed FIR to an IIR form. Then we propose a multistage TEQ method with the Steiglitz McBride method. Based on the structures, we analyze the computational complexity. Simulations show that the proposed method is almost the same performance as the existing ones and its computation can be reduced dramatically.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4428957","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 -

The iris images captured from the same person or different persons differ in size due to illumination variations and other factors. The iris recognition system is composed of many steps. Namely, capturing the iris patterns; determining the location of the iris boundaries; converting the iris boundary to the polar coordinate system; extracting the iris code based on wavelet transforms; and classification of the iris code. There are many methods proposed for iris recognition by many researchers. The proposed system based on dual tree complex wavelet transform for iris recognition system with high performance and acceptance/rejection capabilities is described.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04429050.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iris recognition based on dual tree complex wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris recognition","Wavelet transforms","Biometrics","Feature extraction","Humans","Image segmentation","Educational institutions","Image edge detection","Telecommunications","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","image recognition","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iris recognition","dual tree","complex wavelet transform","personal identification","personal verification","biometrics","iris boundary","polar coordinate system","iris code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"An iris recognition based on dual tree complex wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429050/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823011","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iris recognition based on dual tree complex wavelet transform","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12062007-000280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120026S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4429050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429051,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Lei","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, China","Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Lei","id":"37286772500"},{"name":"Shan ouyang","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"ouyang","id":"37272275500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1271-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4429051","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Radar imaging","Finite difference methods","Ground penetrating radar","Ultra wideband radar","Radar detection","Ultra wideband technology","Bandwidth","Apertures","Microwave imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","electromagnetic wave refraction","finite difference time-domain analysis","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain beamformer","UWB through-wall imaging","ultra-wideband short-pulse signal","through-wall radar imaging","wave refraction","finite-difference time-domain","FDTD"]}],"abstract":"A time-domain beamformer using ultra-wideband short-pulse (UWB SP) signal for through-wall imaging (TWI) applications is proposed in this paper.

Assuming full channel knowledge at the receiver near-ML performance at low complexity can be achieved by so-called sphere decoding.

On the other hand, the performance of the sphere decoding is restricted by fading caused by multipath propagation.

Many of the cardiac problems are visible as distortions in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Normally ECG related diagnoses are carried out by the medical practitioners manually. The major task in diagnosing the heart condition is analyzing each heart beat and co-relating the distortions found therein with various heart diseases. Since the abnormal heart beats can occur randomly it becomes very tedious and time-consuming to analyze say a 24 hour ECG signal, as it may contain hundreds of thousands of heart beats. Hence it is desired to automate the entire process of heart beat classification and preferably diagnose it accurately. In this paper the authors have focused on the various schemes for extracting the useful features of the ECG signals for use with artificial neural networks. Once feature extraction is done, ANNs can be trained to classify the patterns reasonably accurately. Arrhythmia is one such type of abnormality detectable by an ECG signal. The three classes of ECG signals are Normal, Fusion and Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC). The task of an ANN based system is to correctly identify the three classes, most importantly the PVC type, this being a fatal cardiac condition. Transform feature extraction and morphological feature extraction schemes are mostly preferred. Discrete Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis, and Discrete Wavelet Transform are the three transform schemes along with three other morphological feature extraction schemes are discussed and compared in this paper","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429096","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04429096.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A brief performance evaluation of ECG feature extraction techniques for artificial neural network based classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429096/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A brief performance evaluation of ECG feature extraction techniques for artificial neural network based classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429096/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9823057","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A brief performance evaluation of ECG feature extraction techniques for artificial neural network based classification","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12062007-000326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053357S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4429096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4429099,"authors":[{"name":"Tyrone W.

All of circuits are designed based on 0.18 mum CMOS technology with a single 1.8 volt power supply.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429101","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04429101.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact mixer and DAC for implementation of a direct conversion OQPSK transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A compact mixer and DAC for implementation of a direct conversion OQPSK transmitter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429101/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823062","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4429101/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact mixer and DAC for implementation of a direct conversion OQPSK transmitter","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12062007-000331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050444S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4429101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429110,"authors":[{"name":"Yin-Tsung Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yin-Tsung Hwang","id":"37333724200"},{"name":"Ying-Ji Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Ji Chen","id":"37836258700"},{"name":"Wei-Da Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wei-Da Chen","id":"37537269300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1271-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4429110","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","MIMO","OFDM","Hardware","Process design","Delay","Computer architecture","Scalability","Wireless communication","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable FFT kernel designs","MIMO OFDM","communication systems","scalable FFT processor design","multi-standard MIMO processing","multi-path delay commutator","pre- ordering data buffer","data flow reconfiguration"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel scalable FFT processor design capable of handling various transform sizes and data channels for multi-standard MIMO processing.

Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) is trained with obtained closest loadability margins for different operating points in normal and contingency conditions. As an important result, online contingency ranking is obtained in addition to prediction of the closest loadability margin for current operating point.

This paper proposes a 32-bit datapath implementation in small Xilinx FPGA Chip (Spartan-3 XC3S200). It uses 148 slice, 11 block RAMs (BRAMs) and achieves the data stream of 647 Mega bits per second ( Mbps) at 287 MHz working frequency.

However, this approach has yet to be investigated for multi-objective problems with higher dimensionality. In this paper, our objective is to conduct comprehensive empirical tests for cooperative coevolution using an evolutionary multiobjective algorithm for 3-dimensional problems. A new algorithm which integrates cooperative coevolutionary (CC) and the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) is proposed to achieve this objective. The resulting algorithm is referred to as the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 with cooperative coevolution (SPEA2-CC). The performance between SPEA2- CC is compared against SPEA2 in solving tri-objectives problems in DTLZ suite of test problems. The results showed that SPEA2-CC clearly outperforms SPEA2, further proving the validity and effectiveness of augmenting evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with the cooperative coevolution approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pareto optimization","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Collaboration","Artificial intelligence","Sorting","Current measurement","Pareto analysis","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative coevolution algorithm","Pareto multiobjective optimization","SPEA2","evolutionary multiobjective optimization","strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429134","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429134","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04429134.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429134/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative coevolution for pareto multiobjective optimization: An empirical study using SPEA2","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9823095","htmlLink":"/document/4429134/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative coevolution for pareto multiobjective optimization: An empirical study using SPEA2","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12062007-000364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086687S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4429134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429140,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Hwa Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Hwa Liu","id":"37087172640"},{"name":"Jen-Hao Teng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Hao Teng","id":"37087170983"},{"name":"Chin-Hsin Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Hsin Hsieh","id":"37087170998"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1271-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4429140","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"abstract":"Recent advances in semiconductor technology have renewed interest in class-D audio amplifiers, especially for portable devices and consumer electronics. The motivating factor driving research in class-D amplifiers is efficiency. In addition, one important benefit that class-D amplifiers bring is the ability to directly couple to a digital audio signal, removing the need to convert to analog first. In this paper, a FPGA based digital audio amplifier has been developed, implemented and tested. The proposed class-D amplifier system can keep the audio signal chain in the digital domain, which prevents transmission noise from distorting the audio signal. In order to achieve the goals of high fidelity and high efficiency, a zero voltage switching (ZVS) modulation strategy is also presented. The experimental system demonstrates that fully digital audio amplification is possible. According to the experimental results, the proposed test system is able to deliver more than 15 W into a 4 \u03a9 load with an efficiency of 80% and total harmonic distortion less than 2%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","Pulse width modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Space vector pulse width modulation","Zero voltage switching","Topology","Circuits","Digital control","Decoding","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signals","audio-frequency amplifiers","consumer electronics","field programmable gate arrays","semiconductor technology","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-D audio amplifier system","semiconductor technology","portable devices","consumer electronics","digital audio signal","FPGA-based digital audio amplifier","field programmable gate array","zero voltage switching","ZVS modulation strategy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429140","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04429140.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of a fully-digital, high efficiency class-D amplifier system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of a fully-digital, high efficiency class-D amplifier system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429140/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429140/","accessionNumber":"9823101","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of a fully-digital, high efficiency class-D amplifier system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12062007-000370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050879S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4429140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4429144,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Hao Tien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Hao Tien","id":"37648898300"},{"name":"Chen-Pin Tu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Pin Tu","id":"37402600500"},{"name":"Guu-Chang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Guu-Chang Yang","id":"37276271000"},{"name":"Wing C.

To mitigate the soft ambiguity in the multiuser detection, a three-level hard-limiter on each chip is proposed with the detection thresholds determined by maximum-likelihood criterion. Based on the evaluation of PDFs of chip corresponding to different number of users hit on it, soft output is derived. Since the channel is non-binary, non-binary LDPC code make there no binary-symbol conversion loss between multiuser detection and channel decoder. Those users whose soft reliability values of the estimated coded symbols exceed a predefined threshold are defined as reliable users. As iteration proceeds, the number of reliable users is increased and multiuser detection process is carried out. Numerical results show that in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels, the performances of three-level systems outperform two-level systems and performances in AWGN channels are better than that in Rayleigh channels. However, for two-level systems, the performance in AWGN channel takes no benefit over Rayleigh channel due to useful information is lost.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429157","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2007 - 2007 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4428769/4428770/04429157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2007.4429157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4428770","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A soft multiuser demodulation for non-binary LDPC coded FFH MA/MFSK systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A soft multiuser demodulation for non-binary LDPC coded FFH MA/MFSK systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429157/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9823118","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4429157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A soft multiuser demodulation for non-binary LDPC coded FFH MA/MFSK systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-12062007-000387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063919S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4428769","isNumber":"4428770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4428769","xplore-issue":"4428770","articleId":"4429157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429180,"authors":[{"name":"Qiyao Yu","affiliation":["Eutrovision, Inc., Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4670323/4429180/4429180-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiyao Yu received the BASc degree from Tsinghua University, China, in 1997, the MASc degree from Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada, in 2002, and the PhD degree in systems design engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2006.

First, it uses graduated increased edge penalty (GIEP) functions within the traditional Markov random field (MRF) context model in formulating the objective functions. Second, IRGS uses a region growing technique in searching for the solutions to these objective functions. The proposed IRGS is an improvement over traditional MRF based approaches in that the edge strength information is utilized and a more stable estimation of model parameters is achieved. Moreover, the IRGS method provides the possibility of building a hierarchical representation of the image content, and allows various region features and even domain knowledge to be incorporated in the segmentation process. The algorithm has been successfully tested on several artificial images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","volume":"30","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10313088","pubMedId":"18988947","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429180/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"IRGS: Image Segmentation Using Edge Penalties and Region Growing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IRGS: Image Segmentation Using Edge Penalties and Region Growing","sourcePdf":"ttp2008122126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086037S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4670323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"4670323","articleId":"4429180","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4429192,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Arino","affiliation":["Universitat Jaume I, de la Plana, Castell\u00f3, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Arino","id":"37398088700"},{"name":"Antonio Sala","affiliation":["Technical University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Sala","id":"37272874200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4429192","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control system analysis","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Control systems","Uncertainty","Stability","Linear matrix inequalities","Systems engineering and theory","Context modeling","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","fuzzy control systems","multiplicative bounds","uncertain knowledge","Takagi-Sugeno model","membership uncertainty","affine inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)","parallel distributed compensation (PDC)","quadratic stability","relaxed condition","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Fuzzy Logic","Models, Statistical"]},{"kwd":["Fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)","parallel distributed compensation (PDC)","quadratic stability","relaxed condition","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems"]}],"abstract":"In the December 2005 issue of this journal, Lam and Leung proposed stability results for fuzzy control systems where the membership functions in the controller were not the same as those from the process one, but some multiplicative bounds were known.

Three new temporal filtering approaches are proposed and based on constrained versions of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), principal component analysis (PCA), and minimum class distance (MCD), respectively. It is shown that these proposed temporal filters can effectively improve the speech recognition accuracy in various noise-corrupted environments. In experiments conducted on Test Set A of the Aurora-2 noisy digits database, these new temporal filters, together with cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN), provide average relative error reduction rates of over 40% and 27% when compared with baseline Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) processing and CMVN alone, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.913405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4451143/04429197.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.913405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing Modulation Frequency Domain-Based Features for Robust Speech Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429197/","displayDocTitle":"Constructing Modulation Frequency Domain-Based Features for Robust Speech Recognition","volume":"16","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9870022","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429197/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing Modulation Frequency Domain-Based Features for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"16tasl03-hung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155134S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4451143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4451143","articleId":"4429197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4429205,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungyoul Min","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4429199/4429205/4429205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyungyoul Min was born in Busan, Korea in 1980.

In order to reduce computational complexity of the Kalman recursions, the state model in the new algorithm uses only phase rather than both phase and frequency which are usually used in conventional modeling. The frequency is considered as an input term to the system equation and estimated by a phase error detector. A reduced observation model is also introduced to relieve computing load from multiple matrix to scalar operations in the Kalman recursions. Simulations show that the proposed one-state Kalman algorithm has better performance and lower complexity than the two-state Kalman algorithm for synchronization applications. The new algorithm is applied to the cable modem downstream system to demonstrate its effectiveness with FPGA implementation results.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.4429210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4429199/04429210.pdf","startPage":"1260","endPage":"1267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.4429210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Carrier Synchronization Using Decision-Aided Kalman Filtering Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429210/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Carrier Synchronization Using Decision-Aided Kalman Filtering Algorithms","volume":"53","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9726899","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429210/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Carrier Synchronization Using Decision-Aided Kalman Filtering Algorithms","sourcePdf":"p1260-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142648S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4429199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4429199","articleId":"4429210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4429213,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-wei Zheng","affiliation":["Nation Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","College of Information Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4429199/4429213/4429213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zi-Wei Zheng received his B.

Under multipath fading channels, synchronization methods proposed for the single input single output (SISO) OFDM systems may be to fail if they are directly applied to the multiple-antenna OFDM-based DVB-H receivers. In this paper, a plateau removed maximum likelihood synchronization scheme is proposed for the multiple-antenna OFDM-based DVB-H receivers. Compared to the conventional maximum likelihood multiple antenna OFDM synchronization scheme, the proposed scheme not only removes the timing ambiguity caused by the plateau problem and has better detection capability but also is robust to different multipath fading channels. System performance studies are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme for the multiple-antenna OFDM-based DVB-H receiver under different fading channel situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4429199/04429213.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.4429213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.4429213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Plateau Removed Synchronization Techniques for Multiple-antenna OFDM-Based DVB-H Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Digital video broadcasting","Frequency synchronization","OFDM","Fading","Maximum likelihood detection","MIMO","Diversity reception","Timing","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","multibeam antennas","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust plateau removed synchronization","multiple antenna","OFDM","DVB H receivers","digital video broadcasting for handheld systems","maximum likelihood synchronization","multipath fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Plateau Removed Synchronization Techniques for Multiple-antenna OFDM-Based DVB-H Receivers","volume":"53","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4429213/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9726901","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Plateau Removed Synchronization Techniques for Multiple-antenna OFDM-Based DVB-H Receivers","sourcePdf":"p1281-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112733S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4429199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4429199","articleId":"4429213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429217,"authors":[{"name":"Eduard Bertran","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4429199/4429217/4429217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eduard Bertran (SM\u201902) received the Ingeniero and Doctor Ingeniero degrees in Telecommunication Engineering, both from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in 1979 and 1985, respectively.

Hence, the BER performance of proposed scheme is better than that of Zhao's scheme even in a large frequency offset.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.4429221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4429199/04429221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.4429221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429199","startPage":"1333","endPage":"1338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of a New ICI-Self-Cancellation-Scheme in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of a New ICI-Self-Cancellation-Scheme in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9726906","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4429221/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of a New ICI-Self-Cancellation-Scheme in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"p1333-peng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076003S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4429199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4429199","articleId":"4429221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429239,"authors":[{"name":"Young-jin Kim","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4429199/4429239/4429239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Jin Kim (S'05) received the B.E. degree and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997 and 1999, respectively.

However, this technique is not very well suited to be implemented in consumer electronics, such as television, because the method tends to introduce unnecessary visual deterioration such as the saturation effect. One of the solutions to overcome this weakness is by preserving the mean brightness of the input image inside the output image. This paper proposes a new method, known as brightness preserving dynamic histogram equalization (BPDHE), which is an extension to HE that can produce the output image with the mean intensity almost equal to the mean intensity of the input, thus fulfill the requirement of maintaining the mean brightness of the image. First, the method smoothes the input histogram with one dimensional Gaussian filter, and then partitions the smoothed histogram based on its local maximums. Next, each partition will be assigned to a new dynamic range. After that, the histogram equalization process is applied independently to these partitions, based on this new dynamic range. For sure, the changes in dynamic range, and also histogram equalization process will alter the mean brightness of the image. Therefore, the last step in this method is to normalize the output image to the input mean brightness. Our results from 80 test images shows that this method outperforms other present mean brightness preserving histogram equalization methods. In most cases, BPDHE successfully enhance the image without severe side effects, and at the same time, maintain the mean input brightness\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2007.4429280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2007.4429280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4429199/04429280.pdf","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brightness Preserving Dynamic Histogram Equalization for Image Contrast Enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Brightness Preserving Dynamic Histogram Equalization for Image Contrast Enhancement","volume":"53","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429280/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9726939","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429280/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brightness Preserving Dynamic Histogram Equalization for Image Contrast Enhancement","sourcePdf":"p1752-ibrahim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051183S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4429199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"354","xplore-issue":"4429199","articleId":"4429280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4429281,"authors":[{"name":"Suk-ju Kang","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4429199/4429281/4429281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suk-Ju Kang received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University, Rep. of Korea, in 2006.

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian estimation approach which gives a joint solution for these problems. The problem is modeled as a blind sources separation (BSS). The data are M hyperspectral images and the sources are K<M images which are composed of compact homogeneous regions and have mutually disjoint supports. The set of all these regions cover the total surface of the observed scene. To insure these properties, we propose a hierarchical Markov model for the sources with a common hidden classification field which is modeled via a Potts-Markov field. The joint Bayesian estimation of the hidden variable, sources, and the mixing matrix of the BSS gives a solution for all three problems: spectra classification, segmentation, and data reduction of hyperspectral images. The mean field approximation (MFA) algorithm for the posterior laws is proposed for the effective Bayesian computation. Finally, some results of the application of the proposed methods on simulated and real data are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed method compared to other classical methods, such as PCA and ICA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4429302/04429303.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.914227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.914227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429302","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Approach With Hidden Markov Modeling and Mean Field Approximation for Hyperspectral Data Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Bayesian methods","Hyperspectral imaging","Data analysis","Image segmentation","Image analysis","Layout","Approximation algorithms","Computational modeling","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Bayes methods","blind source separation","data reduction","hidden Markov models","image classification","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian approach","hidden Markov modeling","mean field approximation","hyperspectral data analysis","hyperspectral image analysis","spectral classification","spectral segmentation","data reduction","blind sources separation","common hidden classification field","Potts-Markov field","PCA","ICA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian approach","blind sources separation (BSS)","hyperspectral images","mean field approximation (MFA)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Bayes Theorem","Computer Simulation","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Markov Chains","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Spectrum Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Approach With Hidden Markov Modeling and Mean Field Approximation for Hyperspectral Data Analysis","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4429303/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742967","pubMedId":"18270113","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Approach With Hidden Markov Modeling and Mean Field Approximation for Hyperspectral Data Analysis","sourcePdf":"17tip02-bali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081005S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4429302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4429302","articleId":"4429303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4429309,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Fu","affiliation":["Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4429302/4429309/4429309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun Fu (S'07) received the B.E. degree in information engineering from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and intelligence systems from the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in statistics from the Department of Statistics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Urbana, in 2007.

To classify images for versatile applications, an effective algorithm is necessarily designed by systematically considering the data structure, similarity metric, discriminant subspace, and classifier. In this paper, we provide evidence that, besides the Fisher criterion, graph embedding, and tensorization used in many existing methods, the correlation-based similarity metric embodied in supervised multilinear discriminant subspace learning can additionally improve the classification performance. In particular, a novel discriminant subspace learning algorithm, called correlation tensor analysis (CTA), is designed to incorporate both graph-embedded correlational mapping and discriminant analysis in a Fisher type of learning manner. The correlation metric can estimate intrinsic angles and distances for the locally isometric embedding, which can deal with the case when Euclidean metric is incapable of capturing the intrinsic similarities between data points. CTA learns multiple interrelated subspaces to obtain a low-dimensional data representation reflecting both class label information and intrinsic geometric structure of the data distribution. Extensive comparisons with most popular subspace learning methods on face recognition evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CTA. Parameter analysis also reveals its robustness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.914203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4429302/04429309.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"234","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.914203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Classification Using Correlation Tensor Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Image Classification Using Correlation Tensor Analysis","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4429309/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742970","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","pubMedId":"18270114","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Classification Using Correlation Tensor Analysis","sourcePdf":"17tip02-fu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085096S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4429302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4429302","articleId":"4429309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4429330,"authors":[{"name":"Qingjiang Chang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qingjiang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37319491400"},{"name":"Hongyan Fu","affiliation":["Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Fu","id":"37304733300"},{"name":"Yikai Su","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yikai","lastName":"Su","id":"37276451600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4429330","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":602},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal generators","Frequency","Baseband","Optical modulation","Data communication","Phase shift keying","Light sources","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Optical transmitters","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","optical modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downstream multiband signals","upstream data","bidirectional radio-over-fiber system","dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator","baseband signals","frequency-doubled signals","frequency-quadrupled signals","optical carrier suppression","frequency-shifting techniques","differential phase-shift keying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)","dual-parallel Mach\u2013Zehnder modulator (DPMZM)","multiband signals","radio-over-fiber (RoF)","wireline and wireless access"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429330","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2007.912992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","abstract":"We propose and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous generation and transmission of downstream multiband signals and upstream data in a bidirectional radio-over-fiber system.

The model validation is here done within the low input back-off (IBO) region of the power amplifier, thus showing significant nonlinear operation. The figure of merit (FoM) applied is the normalized mean square error (NMSE). A rectangle constellation modulation, 16-QAM, is used as input signal, and the nonlinearities caused by the low IBO operating conditions of the PA distort the output constellation. The PA output signal used to estimate the model coefficients presented high distortion levels, requiring a model capable to also care for memory effects, as it will be seen in this article. It has been observed that the combination of a selection of the optimal delays values with parallel-cascade Hammerstein pseudo-inverse based models can improve the identification accuracy, leading to precise models. This condition is important regarding the design of efficient pre-distorters, once its performance is very sensitive to the model quality.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429423","publicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429423.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"286","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2006.4429423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of optimal delays selection on parallel cascade hammerstein models for the prediction of RF-power amplifier behavior","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Application of optimal delays selection on parallel cascade hammerstein models for the prediction of RF-power amplifier behavior","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4429423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9835715","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of optimal delays selection on parallel cascade hammerstein models for the prediction of RF-power amplifier behavior","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046233S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4429425,"authors":[{"name":"Yasuta Shinohara","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center (AWCC), University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yasuta Shinohara","id":"37825768200"},{"name":"Ryo Ishikawa","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center (AWCC), University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Ryo Ishikawa","id":"37603790600"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Honjo","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center (AWCC), University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazuhiko Honjo","id":"37275579900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-902339-08-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-902339-11-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4429425","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Analytical models","Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic fields","SPICE","Electromagnetic measurements","Gold","Fingers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","finite difference time-domain analysis","heterojunction bipolar transistors","semiconductor device models","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-finger HBT analysis","FDTD method","electromagnetic field simulation","device simulation","SPICE","technology computer aided design","finite-difference time-domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device and EM co-simulation","TCAD","FDTD","long-finger HBT"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an integrated analysis of a FDTD electromagnetic field simulation and a device simulation applying for HBT's having long-finger structure.

According to our results, the latter case does not fulfill the orthogonality condition and therefore it cannot be established that DC power is equal to the fundamental output power as it is assumed in other research works.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429457","publicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429457.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"440","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2006.4429457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic orthogonality condition in RF Class-E Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic orthogonality condition in RF Class-E Power Amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4429457/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9835739","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429457/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic orthogonality condition in RF Class-E Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037958S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4429458,"authors":[{"name":"Sher Azam","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology (IFM), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"lastName":"Sher Azam","id":"37088164153"},{"name":"R.

Furthermore, the different terms, delays and coefficients are shown to be related to Volterra kernels. In order to validate this approach a HEMT amplifier has been constructed and characterized with W-CDMA signals at diverse symbol rates and input levels.

this paper, a varactor-tuned hairpin bandpass filter (BPF) using tapped open stub is proposed so that the passband bandwidth can be maintained nearly constant within the tuning range. The tapped open stub not only works as a K-inverter but also introduces an attenuation pole that can be located at upper or lower side of the passband. Varactors loaded at the end of hairpin resonator and the tapped open stub enable the proposed hairpin BPF to control the center frequency with constant bandwidth. Design equations are derived so that the constant bandwidth requirements can be satisfied with reasonable equivalent circuit parameter value. Hairpin tunable BPF with one tapped open stub is designed and tested at 2 GHz. Also, two open stub's tunable BPF of elliptic-type performance is experimented at 1 GHz.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","startPage":"645","endPage":"648","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429503.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Varactor-tuned hairpin bandpass filter with enhanced stopband performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4429503/","displayDocTitle":"Varactor-tuned hairpin bandpass filter with enhanced stopband performance","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9835573","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Varactor-tuned hairpin bandpass filter with enhanced stopband performance","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047122S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4429517,"authors":[{"name":"Chuming David Shih","affiliation":["RF Power Division, Infineon Technologies, North American Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Chuming David","lastName":"Shih","id":"37692525200"},{"name":"Paul Andersson","affiliation":["RF Power Division, Infineon Technologies, Nordic AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Andersson","id":"37701636400"},{"name":"Reza Bagger","affiliation":["RF Power Division, Infineon Technologies, Nordic AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Bagger","id":"37695816000"},{"name":"Yinglei Yu","affiliation":["RF Power Division, Infineon Technologies, North American Corporation, USA"],"lastName":"Yinglei Yu","id":"37087699509"},{"name":"Abel Rivera","affiliation":["RF Power Division, Infineon Technologies, North American Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Abel","lastName":"Rivera","id":"37840261400"},{"name":"Johan Sjostrom","affiliation":["RF Power Division, Infineon Technologies, Nordic AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Sjostrom","id":"37830800800"},{"name":"Rick Hooper","affiliation":["RF Power Division, Infineon Technologies, North American Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Rick","lastName":"Hooper","id":"37723443200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-902339-08-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-902339-11-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4429517","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Driver circuits","Radio frequency","High power amplifiers","Gain","Application specific integrated circuits","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Modulation","Bandwidth","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","driver circuits","MOS integrated circuits","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear driver IC","RF power amplifiers","RF LDMOS power amplifier driver integrated circuits","cellular base station","power 20 W","frequency 800 MHz to 2300 MHz","bandwidth 200 MHz","bandwidth 300 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDMOS","power amplifiers","IC","broadband","base station","basestation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429517","abstract":"Three 20 W RF LDMOS power amplifier driver integrated circuits (driver ICs) for cellular base station applications have been developed in Si LDMOS IC technologies.

With the introduction of additional internal ports in the filter model, the multi-port admittance-matrix (Y-matrix) is obtained. The main advantage lies in the fact that the filter's basic parameters, as there are the resonant frequency of each resonator, the coupling coefficients and the external Qs are directly accessible through the multi-port Y-matrix. These values are known to give a broad insight into the filter and allow a straightforward optimization procedure to meet the specified data of the synthesis. Furthermore, parasitic effects and design restrictions can be identified and even quantified. Here, an example of a combline filter with a six pole Chebyshev characteristic has been chosen to demonstrate the technique and to verify the method, which can be adapted to other types of filters as well as to other characteristics.

Thus, it can operate on power amplifiers driven in the high efficiency region and relax the strict requirements for the hardware as compared to conventional M-ary QAM systems. The proposed system, however, is sensitive to superposition error.

The measured results show the significant cancellation of IM3 and IM5 components for a two-tone test and the notably improved adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) for four-carrier WCDMA applications over a wide range of output power levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429555.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"890","publicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2006.4429555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearity improvement of RF power amplifiers using a simple high-order predistorter for WCDMA applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Radio frequency","High power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Multiaccess communication","Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Testing","Power measurement","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","broadband networks","code division multiple access","intermodulation distortion","linearisation techniques","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF power amplifiers","WCDMA","high-order predistorter","third-order intermodulation components","fifth-order intermodulation components","class-AB power amplifier","wide-band code division multiple access band","adjacent channel leakage ratio","linearization techniques","two-tone test","frequency 2.11 GHz to 2.17 GHz","power 45 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error generator","intermodulation","LDMOSFET","power amplifier","predistorter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Linearity improvement of RF power amplifiers using a simple high-order predistorter for WCDMA applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9902358","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearity improvement of RF power amplifiers using a simple high-order predistorter for WCDMA applications","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039477S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429557,"authors":[{"name":"Takana Kaho","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Takana Kaho","id":"37087580464"},{"name":"Yo Yamaguchi","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Yo Yamaguchi","id":"37087327743"},{"name":"Tadao Nakagawa","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Tadao Nakagawa","id":"37088139785"},{"name":"Kiyomichi Araki","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"lastName":"Kiyomichi Araki","id":"37087446287"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-902339-08-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-902339-11-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4429557","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":142},"abstract":"We propose a novel adaptive linearization technique for amplifier arrays.

Most design tools for circuits are based on the fundamental circuit theory using the S-matrix combined with the harmonic-balance method. Consequently, the electromagnetic effect is ignored or approximated at best. Therefore, the extended finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method combined with the equivalent circuit simulation had been presented. However, it takes very long times to analyze any circuits. In this paper, we propose a novel extended FDTD method to reduce calculation resources. We investigate its efficiency to compare with the conventional extended FDTD method or measurements, consequently, it is confirmed that the proposal method is required calculation resources less than 10% compared with the conventional method. We also show that the proposal method is able to analyze characteristics of the active integrated antenna(AIA) which are practicably impossible to analyze by using the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2006.4429570","publicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","startPage":"953","endPage":"956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel extended FDTD method for the analysis of the active integrated circuit and antenna mounted non- linear devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel extended FDTD method for the analysis of the active integrated circuit and antenna mounted non- linear devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429570/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9902361","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4429570/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel extended FDTD method for the analysis of the active integrated circuit and antenna mounted non- linear devices","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064476S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4429571,"authors":[{"name":"Kumar Vaibhav Srivastava","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"lastName":"Kumar Vaibhav Srivastava","id":"37086904005"},{"name":"Vishwa V.

integrator and analog-to-digital converter effect on a Multi-Resolution Spectrum Sensing (MRSS) for cognitive radio systems","abstract":"The proposed multi-resolution spectrum sensing (MRSS) technique is a flexible, low-power, high-speed spectrum-sensing solution for cognitive radio systems. Meanwhile, impairments of analog building blocks may degrade the accuracy of the proposed MRSS performance. In this paper, the effect of non-idealities of an integrator is explored. The dominant pole position is suggested to be less than 20% of the spectrum-sensing resolution- bandwidth. Then, the quantization effect of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is addressed when one of a linear amplifier and logarithmic amplifier is present in front of the ADC, respectively. A 7-bit ADC is suggested when a high-dynamic- range logarithmic amplifier is accompanied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429573/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9902362","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429573/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analog integrator and analog-to-digital converter effect on a Multi-Resolution Spectrum Sensing (MRSS) for cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog integrator and analog-to-digital converter effect on a Multi-Resolution Spectrum Sensing (MRSS) for cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066131S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4429582,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Sub Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong-Sub Lee","id":"37087642099"},{"name":"Kye-Ik Jeon","affiliation":["RFcore Limited, Sungnam, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kye-Ik Jeon","id":"37087184836"},{"name":"Yoon-Ha Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yoon-Ha Jeong","id":"37087153704"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-902339-08-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-902339-11-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4429582","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429582","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power system harmonics","High power amplifiers","Design methodology","Propagation losses","Impedance matching","Power transmission lines","Power measurement","Transmission line measurements","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics suppression","power amplifiers","power MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-E LDMOS power amplifier","LDMOSFET","peak envelope power","harmonic power suppression","loss reduction","transmission line","power 10 W","bandwidth 2.14 GHz","gain 13.8 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E power amplifier","drain efficiency","harmonic","LDMOSFET","transmission line"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a high efficiency class-E power amplifier using the experimental-based design method.

The PHEMT Darlington achieves 13 dB of gain at 2 GHz and is monolithically matched to 50 ohms across a wide 0.1-3 GHz bandwidth. The IRL and ORL are better than 15 dB across the band. Noise figure of 3.3 dB and OIP3 of 41.4 dBm are achieved at 2 GHz with a PldB compression of 21.8 dBm. The monolithically matched amplifier achieves > 40 dBm IP3 across a wide 3 GHz band.

A 4-order bandpass filter whose centerfrequency is 5.8GHz, and the bandwidth is 30MHz is designed to prove the effectiveness of the method.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2006.4429618","startPage":"1185","endPage":"1188","publicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429618.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of synthesis of cross-coupled bandpass resonator filters by using Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429618/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A method of synthesis of cross-coupled bandpass resonator filters by using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429618/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9902377","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of synthesis of cross-coupled bandpass resonator filters by using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033718S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4429631,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Luh Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Luh Hsu","id":"37556370700"},{"name":"Jen-Tsai Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Tsai Kuo","id":"37275495600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-902339-08-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-902339-11-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4429631","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip filters","Dual band","Band pass filters","Frequency","Bandwidth","Arm","Microwave filters","Resonator filters","Coupling circuits","Passband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip circuits","microstrip filters","multiplexing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip dual-band filter design","double- diplexing configuration","T- junctions","extended microstrip arms","mutual couplings","two-port F-parameter analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combline","dual-passband","interdigital line","microstrip circuit"]}],"abstract":"Two microstrip filters are diplexed at the input and output ports to realize a dual-band characteristic.

These include a patch, slot, inverted-F, and dipole antenna. Some of them exhibit circular polarization and one is broadband. Impedance is seen to be fairly constant regardless of bending, though if circular polarization is excited by careful antenna shaping, the circular polarization and corresponding resonance are easily lost. The axial ratios of all examined antennas degrade quickly with decreasing bend radius. Linearly polarized antennas are more tolerant to bending effects, though their polarization may twist and main lobe direction change.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of bending GPS antennas","publicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2006.4429712","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429712.pdf","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Effects of bending GPS antennas","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429712/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9835471","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of bending GPS antennas","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041517S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4429728,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos E.

Its conversion loss is around 6.7 dB and relative flat across this frequency range. Around its center frequency, the amplitude balance is less than 0.1 dB and the phase balance is almost ideal 180deg.

Simulations are realized in order to validate and evaluate the performance of the proposed model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new computational parallel model applied in 3D ray-tracing techniques for radio-propagation prediction","publicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2006.4429771","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429360/4429361/04429771.pdf","startPage":"1859","endPage":"1862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2006.4429771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429361","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A new computational parallel model applied in 3D ray-tracing techniques for radio-propagation prediction","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429771/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9835517","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new computational parallel model applied in 3D ray-tracing techniques for radio-propagation prediction","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066766S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4429360","isNumber":"4429361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429360","xplore-issue":"4429361","articleId":"4429771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE of JapanIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4429773,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The realization is based on Baugh-Wooley's algorithm, which partitions the multiplication into unsigned and signed sections. To achieve efficient implementation, a set of optimized schemes for the realization of multi-level additions of the partial products is proposed. Our approach has been evaluated through the implementation of squarers for operands with sizes ranging from 20 to 128 bits. The designs are synthesized and implemented on Xilinx' Spartan-3 with ISE 8.1 design platform and compared with the standard implementation, and with Xilinx' IP Core. The results indicate that our approach offers substantial LUT savings by up to 52% with an average delay reduction of 13%. The usage of the number of embedded multipliers is reduced by 38% compared with the standard schemes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Military computing","Embedded computing","Design optimization","Educational institutions","Design engineering","Partitioning algorithms","Table lookup","Delay","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based efficient design approach","squarers","delay reduction","embedded multipliers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429952","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429952","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429947/4429948/04429952.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429952/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Efficient Design Approach for Large-Size Two's Complement Squarers","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9832730","htmlLink":"/document/4429952/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Efficient Design Approach for Large-Size Two's Complement Squarers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ASAP-00-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112218S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4429947","isNumber":"4429948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429947","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4429948","articleId":"4429952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4429953,"authors":[{"name":"Antonino Tumeo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonino","lastName":"Tumeo","id":"37391915300"},{"name":"Matteo Monchiero","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Monchiero","id":"37424560000"},{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Palermo","id":"37391879400"},{"name":"Fabrizio Ferrandi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Ferrandi","id":"37298982800"},{"name":"Donatella Sciuto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Sciuto","id":"37273958200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1026-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1027-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"4429953","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Reconfigurable logic","Costs","Computer architecture","Application specific integrated circuits","Performance loss","Hardware","Prototypes","Switches","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image coding","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["JPEG encoder","dynamic reconfiguration","FPGA design","reconfigurable computing"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic reconfiguration allows to selectively substitute blocks of logic at run-time in order to improve the area efficiency of a FPGA design.

The complexity of hardware design methodologies for FPGAs requires specialist engineering knowledge and presents a significant barrier to entry for scientific users with only a software background. Recently, a number of High-Level Languages (HLLs) for programming FPGAs have emerged that aim to lower this barrier and abstract away hardware-dependent details. This paper presents the results of a study on implementing hardware accelerators using the Mitrion-C HLL. The implementation of two floating-point scientific kernels: dense matrix-vector multiplication (DMVM) and the computation of spherical boundary conditions in molecular dynamics (SB) are described. We describe optimizations that are essential for taking advantage of both the features of the HLL and the underlying HPRC hardware and libraries. Scaling of the algorithms to multiple FPGAs is also investigated. With four FPGAs, 80 times speedup over an Itanium 2 CPU was achieved for the DMVM, while a 26 times speedup was achieved for SB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of a High-Level-Language Methodology for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429954","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429947/4429948/04429954.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of a High-Level-Language Methodology for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429954/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9832737","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of a High-Level-Language Methodology for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ASAP-00-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033463S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4429947","isNumber":"4429948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429947","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4429948","articleId":"4429954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429955,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Huang","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37402214700"},{"name":"David Grunert","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Grunert","id":"37832069400"},{"name":"Lothar Thiele","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lothar","lastName":"Thiele","id":"37274921100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1026-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1027-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"4429955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Windowed FIFOs for FPGA-based Multiprocessor Systems","abstract":"FPGA-based multiprocessor systems are viable solutions for stream-based embedded applications.

The new concept allows non-destructive read, reordering, and skipping of data within a communication channel. We present the behavior, the software interface and the hardware design of this mechanism.

Experiments based on 20 custom instructions reveal that the estimation results show an average of only 8% increase in the area costs when compared with the corresponding hardware synthesized results.

Previous work in reconfigurable hardware has focused on implementations of 2D 8times8 transforms of the type commonly used in the JPEG and MPEG standards. Several applications for larger DCTs exist, including those involving the extraction of features from image data, solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and those utilizing the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method such as phase-unwrapping. This paper presents an indirect algorithm and implementation on a Xilinx FPGA that performs 1D DCTs on large block sizes using a block floating point format. The DCT was designed to use fewer resources than other popular approaches due to the larger point sizes supported which would otherwise consume all available chip area, but at the cost of higher latency. This latency is similar to that required for an identically sized FFT A 512-point DCT has been shown to take 1771 cycles or 13.3 us at 133 MHz as compared to a similarly sized FFT that takes 1757 cycles or 13.2 us (including all component transfer times).","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429965","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429947/4429948/04429965.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 1D Discrete Cosine Transform For Large Point Sizes Implemented On Reconfigurable Hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429965/","displayDocTitle":"The 1D Discrete Cosine Transform For Large Point Sizes Implemented On Reconfigurable Hardware","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9808521","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429965/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The 1D Discrete Cosine Transform For Large Point Sizes Implemented On Reconfigurable Hardware","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ASAP-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059988S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4429947","isNumber":"4429948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429947","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4429948","articleId":"4429965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4429972,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Aguiar","affiliation":["Universidade de Santa Cruz do Su, Santa Cruz do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Aguiar","id":"37409237100"},{"name":"Marcio Kreutz","affiliation":["Universidade de Santa Cruz do Su, Santa Cruz do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcio","lastName":"Kreutz","id":"37414276100"},{"name":"Rafael Santos","affiliation":["Universidade de Santa Cruz do Su, Santa Cruz do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Santos","id":"38546393600"},{"name":"Tatiana Santos","affiliation":["Universidade de Santa Cruz do Su, Santa Cruz do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Tatiana","lastName":"Santos","id":"37300467500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1026-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1027-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"4429972","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Distributed computing","Genetic algorithms","Application software","Grid computing","High performance computing","Computer architecture","Costs","Supercomputers","Embedded software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design flow","computer cluster","distributed genetic algorithm","computer grids"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429972","abstract":"In the past few years, computer grids and clusters of computers have been widely used in order to keep up with the high computational performance required by high-end applications. Also, they are especially attractive due to their good performance at relatively low cost, if compared to powerful servers and supercomputers. The same scenario can be faced on the embedded world, where high specialized tasks are usually partitioned to dedicated processors composing distributed systems. This work is focused on the architectural specialization of cluster machines by analysing application behavior and optimizing instruction-set architectures. The motivation for this work relies on the observation that tasks found in embedded software present a behavior that normally can be implemented by a subset of instruction-set architectures. This opens opportunities for optimization by removing the not needed instructions. As a consequence, processors become specialized since their resources fit better to applications performance and power consumption constraints. This work proposes a design flow to adapt cluster machines to the constraints of embedded applications, where high flexibility and performance are achieved by hardware customization and its further distribution. Moreover, it is presented a case of study with the entire design flow description as well as the synthesis results.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429972","startPage":"148","endPage":"153","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429948","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429947/4429948/04429972.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Flow of a Dedicated Computer Cluster Customized for a Distributed Genetic Algorithm Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429972/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design Flow of a Dedicated Computer Cluster Customized for a Distributed Genetic Algorithm Application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429972/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9808527","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Flow of a Dedicated Computer Cluster Customized for a Distributed Genetic Algorithm Application","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ASAP-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050137S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4429947","isNumber":"4429948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429947","xplore-issue":"4429948","articleId":"4429972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429975,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

Due to their high computational load and intrinsic parallelism, they are ideal candidates for acceleration using reconfigurable hardware. However, for maximum efficiency the hardware configuration must be parametrised to match the characteristics of both the simulation task and the platform on which it will be executed. This paper presents a methodology for the automatic implementation of Monte-Carlo simulations, starting from a high-level mathematical description of the simulation and resulting in an optimised hardware configuration for a given platform. This process automatically generates fully-pipelined hardware for maximum performance; it also maximises thread-level parallelism by instantiating multiple pipelines to optimise device utilisation. The configured hardware is used by an associated software component to execute simulations using run-time supplied parameters. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by five different Monte-Carlo simulations, including log-normal price movements, correlated asset Value-at-Risk calculation, and price movements under the GARCH model. Our results show that hardware implementations from our approach, on a Xilinx Virtex-4 XC4VSX55 FPGA at 150 MHz, can run on-average 80 times faster than software on a 2.66 GHz Xeon PC.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429975","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429947/4429948/04429975.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Generation and Optimisation of Reconfigurable Financial Monte-Carlo Simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429975/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Generation and Optimisation of Reconfigurable Financial Monte-Carlo Simulations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9832731","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429975/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Generation and Optimisation of Reconfigurable Financial Monte-Carlo Simulations","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ASAP-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062773S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4429947","isNumber":"4429948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429947","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4429948","articleId":"4429975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4429981,"authors":[{"name":"Siavash Bayat-Saramdi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Siavash","lastName":"Bayat-Saramdi","id":"38270187400"},{"name":"M.A. Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37307140300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1026-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1027-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6862"}],"articleNumber":"4429981","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Linear code","Galois fields","Polynomials","Circuits","Computer errors","Channel coding","Very large scale integration","Cryptography","Digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","error detection codes","linear codes","multiplying circuits","polynomials","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-time error detection probability","polynomial basis multiplication","linear codes","channel coding","VLSI testing","cryptography","single-input encoding scheme"]}],"abstract":"In this article we consider detection of errors in polynomial basis multipliers, which have applications in channel coding, VLSI testing, and cryptography.

Processor hardware modifications and subsequent adaptation of software development tools (e.g. assembler, linker and compiler) are described. Additionally, this work focuses on seamless integration of the co-processor to enable ease of use for the application development. Power consumption and silicon area of the co-processor can be reduced by choosing an application specific subset of functions. Hardware description files of ASIP and co-processor are used for functional verification and processing cycle determination. Area and power estimation of the overall architecture is presented for a 90nm standard cell CMOS technology. Finally, a design space exploration of the presented architecture used in a satellite navigation receiver reveals efficient co-processor configurations.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429996","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429947/4429948/04429996.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of a Tightly Coupled ASIP / Co-Processor Architecture Used in GNSS Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4429996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429996/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of a Tightly Coupled ASIP / Co-Processor Architecture Used in GNSS Receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9808543","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4429996/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of a Tightly Coupled ASIP / Co-Processor Architecture Used in GNSS Receivers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ASAP-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048191S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4429947","isNumber":"4429948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429947","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4429948","articleId":"4429996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4429998,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Cope","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Cope","id":"37300244600"},{"name":"Peter Y.K.

The design challenges of implementing five algorithms on two field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and two GPUs are explained and performance results contrasted. Explored algorithm features include data dependence, flexible data reuse patterns and histogram generation. A customisable systemC model, which demonstrates that features of the GPU pipeline can be transferred to a general multi-core architecture, is implemented. The customisations are: choice of processing unit (PU); processing pattern; and on-chip memory organisation. Example tradeoffs are: the choice of processing pattern for histogram equalisation; choice of number of PUs; and memory sizing for motion vector estimation. It is shown that a multi-core architecture can be optimised for video processing by combining a GPU pipeline with cores that support reconfigurable datapath operations.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4429947/4429948/04429998.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429998","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4429948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridging the Gap between FPGAs and Multi-Processor Architectures: A Video Processing Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bridging the Gap between FPGAs and Multi-Processor Architectures: A Video Processing Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4429998/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4429998/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9832740","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridging the Gap between FPGAs and Multi-Processor Architectures: A Video Processing Perspective","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ASAP-00-50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059342S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4429947","isNumber":"4429948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4429947","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4429948","articleId":"4429998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"}]
