This technique expands the scope of approximate computing to scientific and engineering applications. The changing error resilience of PCG during the solving process is exploited by different levels of approximation which trade off numerical precision and hardware utilization. Such approximation levels are determined at runtime by periodically estimating the error resilience. An efficient fault tolerance technique allows reductions in hardware utilization by ensuring the continued exploitation of suitable energy-precision trade-offs. Experimental results show that the hardware utilization is reduced on average by 14.5% and by up to 41.0% compared to executing PCG on precise hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7684063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7684063/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16424508","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applying efficient fault tolerance to enable the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver on approximate computing hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying efficient fault tolerance to enable the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver on approximate computing hardware","confLoc":"Storrs, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081207S","chronDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590261","isNumber":"7684053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590261","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7684053","articleId":"7684063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7684069,"authors":[{"name":"Hananeh Aliee","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Hananeh","lastName":"Aliee","id":"37586367100"},{"name":"Stefan Vitzethum","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Vitzethum","id":"37085906164"},{"name":"Michael Gla\u00df","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gla\u00df","id":"37355962600"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Teich","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"},{"name":"Emanuele Borgonovo","affiliation":["Bocconi University, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Borgonovo","id":"37085902529"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3623-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3624-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7684069","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Embedded systems","Space exploration","Reliability engineering","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","embedded systems","genetic algorithms","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guiding genetic algorithms","reliable embedded system design","reliability importance measures","optimization process","power consumption","resource cost","electronic system-level"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7684069","abstract":"Reliability importance measures (IMs) support analysts in understanding the contributions of components to the reliability of the system under investigation.

However, network and compute intensive NFs may be difficult to virtualize without performance degradation. In this context, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been shown to be a good option for hardware acceleration of virtual NFs that require high throughput, without deviating from the concept of an NFV infrastructure which aims at high flexibility. Regular expression matching is an important and compute intensive mechanism used to perform Deep Packet Inspection, which can be FPGA-accelerated to meet performance constraints. This solution, however, introduces new challenges regarding dependability requirements. Particularly for FPGAs, soft errors on the configuration memory are a significant dependability threat.

The long-term objective is to propose and decide how to protect these vulnerable parts without impacting the characteristic features of ARM processors: energy-efficiency and high-performance.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2016.7684076","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590261/7684053/07684076.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2016.7684076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft error vulnerability assessment of the real-time safety-related ARM Cortex-R5 CPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7684076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7684076/","displayDocTitle":"Soft error vulnerability assessment of the real-time safety-related ARM Cortex-R5 CPU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7684076/","conferenceDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft error vulnerability assessment of the real-time safety-related ARM Cortex-R5 CPU","confLoc":"Storrs, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065994S","chronDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590261","isNumber":"7684053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590261","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7684053","articleId":"7684076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7684081,"authors":[{"name":"Ronak Salamat","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Ronak","lastName":"Salamat","id":"37945716600"},{"name":"Masoumeh Ebrahimi","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Masoumeh","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37398164600"},{"name":"Nader Bagherzadeh","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Bagherzadeh","id":"37085535635"},{"name":"Freek Verbeek","affiliation":["Open University of The Netherlands, Radboud University, Nijmegen"],"firstName":"Freek","lastName":"Verbeek","id":"37411828200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3623-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3624-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7684081","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Routing","Elevators","System recovery","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","fault tolerance","integrated circuit reliability","network routing","network-on-chip","thermal stresses","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CoBRA","low cost compensation","3D-NoC","power efficient connection","through-silicon-vias","thermal stress","manufacturing process","reconfigurable fault-tolerant routing algorithm","fabrication-time tolerance","run-time TSV failure","fault-free communication","elevator-first routing algorithm","network-on-chip"]}],"abstract":"3D-NoC has emerged to provide fast and power efficient connection between the layers of 2D-NoCs using Through-Silicon-Vias (TSV). Thermal stress, warpage, impurities and misalignment during the manufacturing process make these expensive TSVs vulnerable to faults. Chips with faulty TSVs should be either discarded or utilized by providing a proper fault-tolerant method. In this paper, we target designing a reconfigurable fault-tolerant routing algorithm capable of tolerating fabrication-time or run-time TSV failures. The proposed algorithm ensures a fault-free communication between any two nodes in the presence of TSV failures. Experimental results show that the proposed fault-tolerant routing algorithm provides 100% reliability as long as there is one healthy TSV in the eastmost or westmost column. The reliability of the counterpart algorithm, the Elevator-first routing algorithm, drops to 75% and 45% in presence of one and two faulty TSVs, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2016.7684081","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590261/7684053/07684081.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2016.7684081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CoBRA: Low cost compensation of TSV failures in 3D-NoC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7684081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7684081/","displayDocTitle":"CoBRA: Low cost compensation of TSV failures in 3D-NoC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424507","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7684081/","conferenceDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CoBRA: Low cost compensation of TSV failures in 3D-NoC","confLoc":"Storrs, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085642S","chronDate":"19-20 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590261","isNumber":"7684053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590261","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7684053","articleId":"7684081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7684102,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Wei","id":"38490656200"},{"name":"Gihan J.

In every datacenter, thousands of virtual servers or virtual machines run at any instance of time which hosts many tasks and in parallel cloud system should keep receiving the batches of task requests. In this context, out of many powered on servers only few targeted servers should fulfill batch of incoming tasks. Hence, task scheduling is an important issue which greatly influences the performance of cloud. The main objective of the scheduling algorithms in cloud environment is to utilize the resources efficiently while balancing the load between resources, to get the minimum execution time. In this paper we designed a rank based efficient task scheduler which effectively utilizes resources and provides high performance than spaceshared and timeshared task schedulers. This algorithm has been tested using CloudSim toolkit and results were compared with spaceshared and timeshared task schedulers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Data Mining and Advanced Computing (SAPIENCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590274/7684105/07684151.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"346","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Data Mining and Advanced Computing (SAPIENCE)","doi":"10.1109/SAPIENCE.2016.7684151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAPIENCE.2016.7684151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684105","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7684151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank based efficient task scheduler for cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Virtual machining","Analytical models","Round robin","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rank based efficient task scheduler","cloud computing","cloud data centers","data storage","cloud services","parallel cloud system","task scheduling","scheduling algorithms","load balancing","resource utilization","CloudSim toolkit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Task","VM","Scheduler","Cloud Computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7684151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Rank based efficient task scheduler for cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7684151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16540597","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank based efficient task scheduler for cloud computing","confLoc":"Ernakulam, India","sourcePdf":"SAP16-230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064491S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590274","isNumber":"7684105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590274","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7684105","articleId":"7684151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7684172,"authors":[{"name":"Vincy Devi V.K","affiliation":["Dept of Computer Applications, Sree Narayana Gurukulam College of Engineering, Kolenchery, Ernakulam dist, Kerala"],"lastName":"Vincy Devi V.K","id":"38558216400"},{"name":"Rajesh R","affiliation":["Dept of Computer Applications, Sree Narayana Gurukulam College of Engineering, Kolenchery, Ernakulam dist, Kerala"],"lastName":"Rajesh R","id":"37086074204"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8594-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8595-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7684172","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7684172","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bones","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Transforms","Ultrasonic imaging","Neural networks","Pregnancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","feature extraction","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection","obstetrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["down syndrome detection","artificial neural network","classifier training","wavelet transforms","DCT","discrete cosine transform","transform domain","spatial domain","medical imaging techniques","image processing based features extraction","nasal bone region contrast","gestation","foetus image","pregnancy","nasal bone absence","genetic disorder","ultrasonogram images","time 11 week to 13 week"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Down Syndrome","Feature extraction","DCT","Wavelet decomposition","Back Propagation Neural Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAPIENCE.2016.7684172","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590274/7684105/07684172.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Data Mining and Advanced Computing (SAPIENCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Data Mining and Advanced Computing (SAPIENCE)","startPage":"204","endPage":"209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAPIENCE.2016.7684172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on Down syndrome detection based on Artificial Neural Network in Ultra sonogram images","abstract":"Down syndrome is a genetic disorder in which disrupts infants, physical and cognitive development. Down syndrome is characterized by the absence of nasal bone during the late first trimester of pregnancy. Presently Down syndrome is identified by visually examining the ultra sonogram image of foetus of 11 to 13 weeks of gestation for the presence of nasal bone. The visually identification by the change in the contrast of nasal bone region of ultra sonogram is a very difficult task. So the image processing based features extraction by considering various parameters have been extremely important. This paper provides comprehensive survey on various medical imaging techniques that can be effectively used for detecting the syndrome in the early stage of pregnancy. Our proposed survey consider different methods based on the various parameters extracted using a series of operations such as Region Of Interest (ROI), Nasal Bone (NB) segmentation using morphological, Otsu thresholding and logical operations from the ultra sonogram images, both in spatial domain as well as transform domain using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and wavelet transforms. The extracted data is normalized and used to train classifiers like Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN).

In order to achieve very high accuracy, recent pedestrian detectors have been based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Unfortunately, such approaches require vast amounts of computational power and memory, preventing efficient implementations on embedded systems. This work proposes a CNN-based detector, adapting a general-purpose convolutional network to the task at hand. By thoroughly analyzing and optimizing each step of the detection pipeline, we develop an architecture that outperforms methods based on traditional image features and achieves an accuracy close to the state-of-the-art while having low computational complexity. Furthermore, the model is compressed in order to fit the tight constrains of low power devices with a limited amount of embedded memory available. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) it proves that a region based deep neural network can be finely tuned to achieve adequate accuracy for pedestrian detection (2) it achieves a very low memory usage without reducing detection accuracy on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced memory region based deep Convolutional Neural Network detection","doi":"10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2016.7684706","startPage":"15","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2016.7684706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7684690","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 6th International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 6th International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590260/7684690/07684706.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7684706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7684706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Reduced memory region based deep Convolutional Neural Network detection","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7684706/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413248","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced memory region based deep Convolutional Neural Network detection","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p15-tome.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084414S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590260","isNumber":"7684690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590260","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7684690","articleId":"7684706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7684711,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Joaquinito","affiliation":["Electronic System Design and Automation, INESC-ID/IST/ULisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Joaquinito","id":"37085892133"},{"name":"Helena Sarmento","affiliation":["Electronic System Design and Automation, INESC-ID/IST/ULisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Helena","lastName":"Sarmento","id":"37344442900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2096-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2097-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7684711","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":392},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Heart rate","Temperature sensors","Biomedical monitoring","Temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical telemetry","biothermics","Bluetooth","data communication","electrocardiography","field programmable gate arrays","lab-on-a-chip","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","smart phones","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless biosignal measurement system","system-on-chip FPGA low energy standard","Bluetooth low energy standard","embedded ARM processor","wireless data transmission","smartphone","body temperature monitoring","heart rate monitoring","steel-head thermistor","ECG acquisition module","real-time operating system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["biosignals","ECG","SoC FPGA","Zynq","Bluetooth Low Energy"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the development of a prototype for a wireless biosignal measurement system, which makes use of a System-on-Chip FPGA, with an embedded ARM processor, and the Bluetooth Low Energy standard for wireless data transmission to a smartphone.

In this paper, we propose an automatic learning resources recommendation algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN can be used to predict the latent factors from the text information. To train the CNN, its input and output should be solved firstly. For its input, the language model is employed. For its output, we propose the latent factor model, which is regularized by L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm. Furthermore, the split Bregman iteration method is introduced to solve the model. The major novelty of the proposed recommendation algorithm is that a new CNN is constructed to make personalized recommendations. Experimental results on public database in terms of quantitative assessment show significant improvements over conventional methods. Especially, it can also work well when the existing recommendation algorithms suffer from the cold-start problem.","doi":"10.1109/ISET.2016.12","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Educational Technology (ISET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Educational Technology (ISET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636499/7685573/07685589.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISET.2016.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7685573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7685589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Recommendation Technology for Learning Resources with Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7685589/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Recommendation Technology for Learning Resources with Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7685589/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"19-21 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16413472","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Recommendation Technology for Learning Resources with Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1651a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073582S","chronDate":"19-21 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636499","isNumber":"7685573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636499","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7685573","articleId":"7685589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"}]
